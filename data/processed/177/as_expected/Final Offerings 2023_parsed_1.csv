177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,1,TABLE OF CONTENTS,1.17,Other Financial Measures and Ratios,1.17.1,,"In this offering memorandum, we present certain unaudited non-IFRS measures and ratios, such as Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Profit, EBITDA, Reported EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Reported EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Capital Expenditures, Maintenance Capital Expenditures, Growth Capital Expenditures, Gross Margin, Total Debt, Net Debt, Net Working Capital, Other Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, Net Interest Paid, Change in Financial Debt and Liquidity (each as defined herein) that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. We believe that non-IFRS financial measures are a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. We believe that Reported EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are relevant measures for assessing our performance because they are adjusted for certain items which, we believe, are not indicative of our underlying operating performance and thus aid in an understanding of EBITDA. We present non-IFRS financial measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. However, non-IFRS financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. In particular, our EBITDA-based measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial statements. Some of these limitations, as applicable, are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; iii ----- - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our income statement; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required to make such replacements; - they do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In addition, our calculation and presentation of EBITDA-based measures in this offering memorandum are different from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA contained in the section entitled “Description of the _Notes” of this offering memorandum, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Accordingly,_ the EBITDA-based measures presented in this offering memorandum may not provide precise indications as to the level of our adherence to the terms of the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Reported EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our results reported under IFRS and using these non-IFRS financial measures only to supplement your evaluation of our performance. In this offering memorandum, we present a reconciliation of each of the non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and discuss its limitations. For a reconciliation of these non-IFRS financial measures, please refer to “Summary Historical _Condensed Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial Data.”_ Our non-IFRS financial measures are defined by us as follows: - We define “EBITDA” as earnings (profit (loss) for the period), before interest, taxes (income taxes), depreciation and amortization. - We define “EBITDA Margin” as EBITDA for each period as a percentage of revenue for the same period. - We define “Reported **EBITDA” as EBITDA adjusted for exchange gains and losses and financial income/expense for adjusting liabilities to fair value. - We define “Reported **EBITDA Margin” as Reported EBITDA for each period as a percentage of revenue for the same period. - We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as Reported EBITDA adjusted for accrual and release of provisions for risks and charges, other impairment losses, bad debt provisions, advisors’ and other costs for one-off transactions, start-up costs of TechMah and HSS and costs relating to reorganizations within the Group. - We define “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA for each period as a percentage of revenue for the same period. - We define “Capital Expenditures” as the increases in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. For internal purposes, we additionally classify our Capital Expenditures into: (i) Growth Capital Expenditures, which we define as increases in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets which, in each case, are discretionary and utilized to expand our business or to increase the long-term operating capacity of our assets or our operating income; and (ii) Maintenance Capital Expenditures, which we define as increases in property, plant and equipment i ----- and other intangible assets which, in each case, are utilized to maintain the efficiency or increase the longevity of our capital assets. - We define “Cash Conversion” as cash flows from operating activities for each period as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA for the same period. - We define “Cost of Goods Sold” as costs and expenses directly associated with the production of products, including costs of the raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods, direct labor costs and amounts paid to third-party service providers. Cost of Goods Sold does not, however, include general overhead expenses. - We define “Gross Profit” as revenue less Cost of Goods Sold. - We define “Gross Margin” as revenue for the period less the Costs of Goods Sold for the period as a percentage of revenue for such period. - We define “Total Debt” as the sum of our indebtedness under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes, lease liabilities, and other financial liabilities. - We define “Total Senior Secured Debt” as our indebtedness secured on certain collateral assets, which as of September 30, 2022, is the indebtedness under the Existing Notes and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. - We define “Net Debt” as Total Debt less cash and cash equivalents. - We define “Total Senior Secured Net Debt” as Total Senior Secured Debt less cash and cash equivalents. - We define “Net Working Capital” as the sum of trade receivables, inventories and other current assets less the sum of trade payables and other current liabilities. - We define “Other Operating Cash Flow” as cash flows relating to taxes, other miscellaneous receivables and payables and cash payments related to costs included in Reported EBITDA (but not Adjusted EBITDA). - We define “Free Cash Flow” as cash flows from operating activities less acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and acquisitions of intangible assets; - We define “Adjusted **Free Cash Flow” as cash flows from operating activities less cash flows used in investing activities (comprising of acquisitions of property, plant and equipment, acquisitions of intangible assets, disposal of property, plant and equipment and disposal of intangible assets). - We define “Net Interest Paid” as the sum of interest income (actually received in cash) and interest paid (in cash) for the period. - We define “Change in Financial Debt” as the sum of net change in current financial liabilities, net change in non-current financial liabilities and decrease in lease liabilities. - We define “Liquidity” as cash and cash equivalents plus amounts available for drawing under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The offering memorandum includes industry and market data pertaining to the Issuer’s business and markets. Such information is based on our analysis of multiple sources such as publicly available information, industry publications and surveys, industry reports prepared by consultants, internal surveys and customer feedback. The market, economic and industry data have primarily been derived and extrapolated from reports provided by the National Joint Registry (“16th annual report 2019” (National Joint Registry for England, Wales, _Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, 2019)) and Registro Italiano ArtroProtesi (“Rapporto ISS COVID-19 n. 7/2021 Rev - Impatto dell’emergenza COVID-19 sui volumi di attività della chirurgia protesica ortopedica in sette Regioni italiane” (Registro Italiano ArtroProtesi, March 31, 2021)), which we believe are useful to investors_ to assess the information relating to our industry, despite the inherent uncertainty of any market analysis and industry data as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, certain statistics, data and other information relating to markets, market sizes, market shares, market positions and other industry data pertaining to the Issuer’s business and markets in this offering memorandum are not based on published data obtained from independent third parties or extrapolations therefrom, but rather are based upon the Issuer’s analysis and best estimates, which are in turn based upon multiple third party sources, including Orthoworld, GIA, Globaldata and services commissioned from a global management consulting company. Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that there can be no assurance as to the accuracy and completeness of such information. We believe that these industry publications, surveys and forecasts are reliable, but we have not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources. Forecasts and other forward-looking information obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and uncertainties as the other forward-looking statements in this offering memorandum. We cannot assure you that any of the assumptions underlying any statements regarding the orthopedic implant industry are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry. Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and speculative and are not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. In addition, the value of comparisons of statistics for different markets is limited by many factors, including that (i) the markets are defined differently, (ii) the underlying information was gathered by different methods and (iii) different assumptions were applied in compiling the data. Accordingly, the market statistics included in this offering memorandum should be viewed with caution and no representation or warranty is given by any person, including the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers, as to their accuracy. Elsewhere in this offering memorandum, statements regarding the orthopedic implant industry are not based on published statistical data or information obtained from independent third-parties, but are based solely on our experience, our internal studies and estimates, and our own investigation of market conditions at the time of this offering memorandum. We cannot assure you that any of these studies or estimates are accurate, and none of our internal surveys or information have been verified by any independent sources. Investors are urged to make their investment decisions based on their own determination and analysis of market and industry data and not to place undue reliance on the industry information presented in this offering memorandum.

177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Industry and Business,13.1.1,We operate in a highly competitive industry and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business.,"The worldwide market for orthopedic implants is highly competitive in terms of pricing, product quality, product innovation, time-to-market and customer service, among other factors. We face numerous competitors, some of which are well-established operators in the global orthopedic devices market and might be better positioned to respond more quickly to the industry's demands for technological innovation, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing or other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners. As we have a less comprehensive product range than certain of our peers, particularly with respect to knee products and hip stems, we may not be able to keep up with our competitors’ access to surgeons and hospital administrators and ability to absorb pricing pressures, which could result in losing some or all of our market share. In particular, our less comprehensive product range than some of our competitors could limit our ability to be competitive in certain sectors or markets compared to competitors who are able to offer a wider range of products and benefit from significant synergies and cross-selling. These gaps in the product portfolio currently prevent us from competing in certain segments within the orthopedic market. In addition to existing competition, we may face competition from new entrants in the markets we target. For example, new start-ups capable of developing new disruptive technologies could enter and/or create new markets in the digital applications business. These factors, alone or in combination, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, our competitors may develop products or technologies that will directly compete with our devices and technology, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As a specialist manufacturer of orthopedic implants, it is important that we are at the forefront of technological change. Our innovative technology and devices have attracted the interest of many companies in the orthopedic implant industry. While several companies have unsuccessfully tried to replicate our technology, including our distinctive Trabecular Titanium (“TT”) and 3D printing technologies, we cannot guarantee that another company will not replicate or develop these technologies in the future. Further, because of how technologically advanced our TT products are, we are able to charge a premium price for these implants, and if a competitor were able to effectively compete with this technology at a lower price, this would affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, even if we were able to demonstrate superior or equivalent results from our technology, practitioners may choose not to use our technology and we may suffer a competitive disadvantage. Should another company be able to develop technologies that address the targeted application for our current technology, this would affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Industry and Business,13.1.2,Our business may be negatively affected by changes in international economic conditions.,"Our business environment is influenced by conditions in the domestic and global economies. In times of economic downturn, we could experience lower demand and a more challenging market environment for our product offerings resulting from a general decline in consumer and business confidence, increased unemployment and difficulties experienced by third party payors. For instance, in addition to a general decline in demand, the strained budgets of many insurers and national healthcare providers put pressure on these entities to contain healthcare costs and reimbursement rates. 55 ----- This may make it more difficult for patients to obtain funding and as a result they may have to modify, delay or cancel any surgical plans that involve purchasing our products. Any of the foregoing factors may cause a decrease in the number of products sold or a reduction in the average selling price we are able to charge for our products, as well as an extension of payment terms. Further, macroeconomic conditions may cause a deterioration in the creditworthiness of certain local or regional public administrations and delays in the collection of trade receivables from national health care systems, which would adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, or operating results. Geopolitical tensions, including but not limited to tensions resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 and tensions between China and the United States, could also negatively affect international economic conditions. In addition, increases in inflation and expectations that annual inflation may remain high for a long period of time (driven at least in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting impact on energy markets) has forced central banks to accelerate the withdrawal of emergency monetary policies and liquidity support measures put in place during the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As some of these measures expire, are withdrawn or are no longer supported by governments, economic growth may be negatively impacted, which in turn may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the implementation of measures, on a global level by national governments and from time to time more restrictive, aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 that have led to limitations of our operations. Hospitals globally have, to varying degrees, suspended and delayed elective surgeries in order to allocate and direct medical supplies and capacity to the COVID-19 response. Some hospitals have also limited access to their facilities or changed access protocols, which has made it difficult for us to support our surgeon customers. The cumulative effect of a significant decrease of elective procedures at hospitals and the increase of their spending supplies and infrastructure to expand system capacity related to COVID-19 had an impact on our business in 2020 and in 2021, and it is not possible for us to accurately predict the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the timing for a broad and sustained resumption of elective surgical procedures. Consistent with national guidelines and with local orders, we continued to operate across our footprint. Notwithstanding our continued operations, and any benefits we received from the economic measures adopted by local governments, we have faced challenges in training and educating surgeons on our surgical techniques and products due to travel restrictions and physical distancing requirements. These restrictions also impacted, albeit to a limited extent, our manufacturing capabilities and distribution and warehousing operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may have further negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, which may lower our revenues, including as a result of the postponement and/or cancellation of elective surgeries in impacted countries. In addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic at certain regulatory bodies have prevented new or modified products from being developed, cleared, approved, certified or commercialized in a timely manner or at all. While regulatory authorities continue to adapt to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic by monitoring and implementing changes to their inspection activities and designation processes to ensure the safety of their employees and those of the firms they regulate, any future disruptions, like those brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact their ability to timely review and process our regulatory submissions and perform their audits, which in turn could negatively impact our business.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

We may not be able to successfully implement the business strategies described in this offering memorandum or those otherwise developed by our business, including the penetration of new market segments, and these strategies may not sustain or improve our results of operations in targeted sectors, or justify their costs.

177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Industry and Business,13.1.5,"We rely on third party suppliers for raw materials and supplies, and such parties’ failure to perform would result in increased production costs.","Our top five suppliers of raw materials and semi-finished products (excluding instrument sets) accounted for 74.5% of our total costs of materials and raw materials for the year ended as of December 31, 2021, with our top supplier accounting for approximately 23.3% of purchases. Should the availability and on-time delivery of raw materials (particularly, titanium powder and ceramics) and supplies necessary for the production of our products and services become unreliable or significantly more costly, then our reputation, relationship with customers and earnings may be materially and adversely impacted. This would be due to the resulting increased costs of production or our inability to supply products in a timely manner or at all. The economic impact from the recent Russian military action in Ukraine has resulted in, and may continue to result in, inflationary pressure in the months to come, affecting energy prices and global supply chains. Though we have not yet experienced supply chain disruptions or material increases in our energy costs or in the prices of our manufacturing materials, including those supplied by third-parties, there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how inflationary increases in our manufacturing material costs, energy costs and supply chain disruptions may develop, which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. We also rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide instrument sets which we consign to hospitals and surgeons to implant our products. In addition, we face risks associated with any supplier’s failure to adhere to quality control and service guidelines or failure to ensure an adequate and timely supply of instrument sets for our products. Any of these factors affecting our suppliers could negatively affect our business and financial performance.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Industry and Business,13.1.6,"The existence of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement is important for the sales of our products; cost-containment efforts, including more rigorous cost-benefit analyses by our customers, purchasing groups, third-party payors and governmental organizations, as well as health care reform, could adversely affect adoption of our products and our future revenue and profitability.","Successful sales of our products depend, in part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental payors, which are essential for achieving product acceptance and widespread adoption in the marketplace. Since our products or procedures using our products are typically covered by public insurance and other government healthcare programs in Italy and other countries, our business is impacted by cost-containment efforts by governments in particular and other third-party payors and customers more generally. For instance, in the United States, prices for orthopedic implants are largely influenced by government and private insurance reimbursement programs. In all the main markets in which we operate, and irrespective of the type of third party payor involved (which differs from country to country), initiatives promoted by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to control healthcare costs are underway. These include price regulation, excise duties and price competition, with the aim of containing the cost of healthcare spending, and which limit both the coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products, including ours. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product or procedures using such product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us or our partners to provide to each payor scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data supporting the use of our products on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Further, as a result of such initiatives, patients have begun to pay more out of their own pockets, which results in patients more closely scrutinizing the products to decide whether the products are worth the money. In addition, in most countries in which we operate, the reimbursement of costs to private and public hospitals is based on predetermined specific rates for each diagnosis related group (DRG) based on diagnoses, procedures, age, sex, discharge status, and the presence of complications or comorbidities. Any changes in the way national healthcare systems reimburse the cost of our products, including, in particular and changes in the current structure of the healthcare system in Italy (our largest single market by revenue), could result in reduced demand or prices for our products, with negative effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 57 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Industry and Business,13.1.7,"We derive a substantial portion of our business from the award of public contracts, which requires frequent participation in competitive, highly regulated public tender offer processes, often limit our ability to negotiate pricing and other terms and make us subject to changes in public spending policies.","We participate in public tenders for contracts with public institutions, including governments and regional and local institutions. Public tender laws generally require that contracts with public institutions for the supply of products such as ours be put to competitive tender upon expiration, and automatic renewal clauses are prohibited. As a result, we must constantly win new contracts to defend our market share and sustain growth and such new contracts may be subject to competitive bidding. Any such new contracts may also themselves be subject to competitive bidding, which is often limited to those companies that can supply comprehensive product portfolios with availability of every device within a certain category. The requirements for these public tender processes are subject to change and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to fulfil the requirements to participate in these. As part of some tenders, we may be required to provide bank and insurance guarantees (including sureties, advance payments or independent guarantee contracts), which we may not be able to obtain. The failure to obtain such contracts–even if due to errors made by our own employees and/or to cases of corporate infidelity–could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, national, regional and local level governments have increasingly relied upon multi-year contracts with pre-established terms and conditions, which, in turn, may require us to make sustained efforts to reduce costs in order to realize profits under such contracts. If we are not successful in reducing the amount of costs we incur, our profitability on contracts with public institutions will be negatively impacted. In addition, in the event we fail to provide the specific devices awarded under a tenders, we could be excluded from future tenders. As of the date of this offering memorandum, many existing and potential customers in the private sector for our products have become members of group purchase organizations, integrated delivery networks and other centralized purchasing agencies (collectively, the “Group Purchase Organizations” or “GPOs”) in an effort to reduce costs. Group Purchase Organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with orthopedic product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. Group Purchase Organizations typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. Bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers with the intention of driving down pricing, with the possible consequence of reducing the market prices of our products as well as our profitability. We may therefore spend significant time and incur significant costs in order to prepare bids or proposals, or participate in the relevant bidding process with Group Purchase Organizations, at the end of which we may not be retained. As a result, due to the highly competitive nature of the contracting processes for Group Purchase Organizations, we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major Group Purchase Organizations across our product portfolio. While having a contract with a Group Purchase Organization for a given product category can facilitate sales to members of that Group Purchase Organization, such contract positions can offer no assurance that sales volumes of those products will be maintained. Group Purchase Organizations may award contracts to multiple suppliers for the same product line and members of the Group Purchase Organization generally are free to purchase from other suppliers. Furthermore, contracts with Group Purchase Organizations typically are terminable without cause upon limited notice and they may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or quality offered by such competitors, which could result in a decline in our sales and profitability. Moreover, the Italian healthcare regulations, as recently supplemented, provide that a yearly budget to purchase medical devices is assigned to each Italian region and, in case such yearly budget is exceeded, each region shall ask for a reimbursement to the medical devices suppliers for a portion of the excess amount, and in proportion to the annual market share of each supplier in the relevant region (the “Payback Mechanism”). In particular, pursuant to Law Decree No. 115 of August 9, 2022 (as converted into Law No. 142/2022), the Italian Ministry of Health determined the amounts in excess of the regional budgets for each of the years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 in its Decree published on September 15, 2022 (the “Decree 216/2022”) and provided the guidelines that the Italian regions shall apply when asking for reimbursements under the Payback Mechanism with a Ministerial Decree published on October 6, 2022 (the “Decree 251/2022”). Pursuant to such mechanism, each region shall issue payment orders to the medical device suppliers by mid-December 2022. Should a supplier not pay the requested amounts in 30 days, Decree 216/2022 provides that such amounts are offset against any outstanding credits such suppliers towards each region and/or the entities affiliated to the regional healthcare 58 ----- system (the “Offset Mechanism”). With Law Decree No. 4 of January 11, 2023, the deadline for the payment of all the amounts required under the Payback Mechanism has been postponed until April 30, 2023. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have received payment orders pursuant to the Payback Mechanism from the regions of Lombardy, Sardinia, Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Piedmont, Apulia, Marche, Tuscany, Umbria, Sicily, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Liguria, as well as from the Autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano, for claimed reimbursement amounts collectively totaling €8.8 million and covering the years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. In addition, we have received certain communications of process commencement from other Italian regions in relation to the years 2015 through 2018, but with no indication of any potential future amount of payment request. In line with the approach of other medical device companies, we timely challenged Decree 216/2022 and Decree 251/2022 before the Regional Administrative Court of the Lazio Region, challenging (among other items) the constitutionality of Decree 216/2022 and Decree 251/2022. We also intend to challenge the above-mentioned payment orders received to date and any further resolution issued by any relevant authority under the Payback Mechanism, also arguing that such challenges in court make it unlawful for the regions and/or the entities affiliated to the Regional Healthcare System to use the Offset Mechanism. On December 12, 2022, the region of Sardinia suspended its resolution No. 1356 of November 28, 2022, whereby it had determined the specific amounts due by each medical device supplier pursuant to Decree 216/2022 and according to the guidelines provided with Decree 251/2022, until the appeals brought before the Administrative Court for Lazio (TAR Lazio) by numerous medical device suppliers (including us) against Decree 216/2022 and Decree 251/2022 are decided.

We also cannot predict the amounts of any related potential future requests. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Italian Ministry of Health will determine that the regional budgets for each of the years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 have been exceeded and, if so, whether the Italian regions will issue further payment orders to us with respect to each of such years, nor can we make a specific assessment on the amounts of the related potential requests (if any) at this stage, since no decree outlining the criteria to quantify liability amounts due by medical devices suppliers under the Payback Mechanism exists with respect to any of these years. In the future, we may determine (in accordance with applicable accounting principles) that the potential liabilities under such payment orders warrant the provision of special reserves in our balance sheet relating to the Payback Mechanism, though the scope and calculation of such liability is uncertain as of the date of this offering memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In addition, this contraction may also occur as devices move into ASCs and as the demand for additional technologies to be offered free of charge increases. One of the results of the rapid innovation in the orthopedic implant industry is that pricing pressure, especially on products containing older technology (and, therefore, subject to commoditization), can be intense. In order to profitably supply these products, we must reduce our production costs in line with the lower net sales price we can expect to receive per unit. Usually, this is accomplished through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies. We may not be able to cease production of unprofitable products, either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons, and as a result, we may incur losses on such products. While the extremities segment has held better pricing for longer, this segment could also experience price erosion. In addition, new, premium products may not sustain premium pricing as the product becomes standardized over time, thereby negatively impacting our margins and profitability. If we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 59 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In addition, some of our customers have required us to obtain one or more internationally-recognized certifications for our activities, or we do on a voluntary basis because the terms of public tenders confer advantages on bidders who are so certified. We incur significant costs and expenses, including any necessary upgrades to our equipment and fixed assets, associated with maintaining these certifications. If we fail to maintain any of our certifications, our business may be harmed because our customers that require them may cease contracting our products which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We continue to assess the potential impact of such developments in the healthcare regulatory environment, as there is no certainty that they will not adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Industry and Business,13.1.10,Legislative or regulatory reforms may have a material adverse effect on us.,"From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may change their marketing authorization or certification procedures and policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions, which may prevent or delay the receipt of marketing authorizations or certifications for our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared or certified products on a timely basis. Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the 510(k) premarket notification pathway. Among other things, the FDA announced that it plans to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. In September 2019, the FDA also issued revised final guidance establishing a “Safety and Performance Based Pathway” for “manufacturers of certain well-understood device types” allowing manufacturers to rely on objective safety and performance criteria recognized by the FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence, obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and will continue to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria and recommended testing methodologies for each such device type, where feasible. The FDA may establish performance criteria for classes of devices for which we or our competitors seek or currently have received clearance, and it is unclear the extent to which such performance standards, if established, could impact our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain clearance or approval for, manufacture, market or distribute our products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require additional testing before obtaining clearance or approval; changes to manufacturing methods; recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products; or additional record keeping. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. In addition, the landscape concerning medical devices in the EU recently evolved. On May 25, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation (“EU Medical Devices Regulation”) entered into force, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, regulations are directly applicable (i.e., without the need for implementation into national law) in all EU member states and are intended 60 ----- to eliminate current differences in the regulatory requirements on medical devices among EU member states. The EU Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The EU Medical Devices Regulation became applicable on May 26, 2021. The new regulation among other things: - strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market (e.g. reclassification of certain devices and wider scope than the EU Medical Devices Directive) and reinforces surveillance once they are available; - establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; - establishes explicit provisions on importers’ and distributors’ obligations and responsibilities; - imposes an obligation to identify a responsible person who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new regulation; - improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end user or patient through the introduction of a unique identification number, to increase the ability of manufacturers and regulatory authorities to trace specific devices through the supply chain and to facilitate the prompt and efficient recall of medical devices that have been found to present a safety risk; - sets up a central database (Eudamed) to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and - strengthens the rules for the assessment of certain high risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo a clinical evaluation consultation procedure by experts before they are placed on the market. These modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to develop our business in the EU and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland). For example, as a result of the transition towards the new regime, notified body review times have lengthened, and product introductions could be delayed or canceled, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”) came into effect on January 1, 2021. The TCA does not specifically refer to medical devices. However, as a result of Brexit, the EU Medical Devices Regulation will not be implemented in the UK, and previous legislation that mirrored the EU Medical Devices Regulation in the UK law has been revoked. The regulatory regime for medical devices in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will continue to be based on the requirements derived from current EU legislation, and the UK may choose to retain regulatory flexibility or align with the EU Medical Devices Regulation going forward. CE markings will continue to be recognized in the UK, and certificates issued by EU-recognized notified bodies will be valid in the UK, until June 30, 2023. For medical devices placed on the market in Great Britain after this period, the UKCA, marking will be mandatory. In contrast, UKCA marking and certificates issued by UK notified bodies will not be recognized on the EU market. The TCA does provide for cooperation and exchange of information in the area of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls (or other similar actions). For medical devices that are locally manufactured but use components from other countries, the “rules of origin” criteria will need to be reviewed. Depending on which countries products will be ultimately sold in, manufacturers may start seeking alternative sources for components if this would allow them to benefit from no tariffs. The rules for placing medical devices on the Northern Ireland market will differ from those in Great Britain. On June 26, 2022, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) published its long-awaited response to its consultation on the UK’s post-Brexit regulatory regime for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The MHRA confirmed that the new regulatory landscape will mirror many of the provisions of the EU regulatory regime, as contained within the EU Medical Devices Regulation. However, the response also highlighted that in certain areas, medical devices regulation in Great Britain is likely to deviate from the EU framework. The UK government now needs to translate its proposals into legislation, via amendments to the UK 61 ----- Medical Devices Regulations (SI 2002 No 618, as amended). These modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to conduct our business in these countries.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In case of product malfunctioning, defects or error in design, we may have to withdraw such products from the market whether by choice or due to a regulatory order from local authorities, which could expose us to product liability. In addition, in some jurisdictions in which we may choose to commercialize our products, we may be subject to strict liability with respect to defects in our products, such that we would be liable for damages even without a demonstration by the plaintiff of negligence or culpability on our part. We cannot provide assurance we will not face product liability claims that result in substantial liability for which we might not be fully insured. A large, successful claim against us, for which we are partially or completely uninsured, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the cost of defending such a claim, together with the costs associated with any payment of damages. Even if a product liability claim is meritless, otherwise unsuccessful or not in excess of our insurance coverage limits, our cash available for other purposes, such as R&D, could be adversely affected, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, under consumer product legislation in many countries, we may be forced to recall or repurchase defective products and more restrictive laws and regulations relating to these matters may be adopted in the future. Negative publicity surrounding our products, caused by product defects, recalls, regulatory investigations, legal proceedings or other events, could also have a negative impact on how our products are perceived in the healthcare industry.

Surgeons play a significant role in determining the course of treatment and, ultimately, the type of product that will be used to treat a patient. Hospitals and other healthcare providers, such as outpatient surgical clinics are increasingly involved in the evaluation of products and product purchasing decisions as well. Some of our most important customers are public entities (including hospitals) which, operating through government-sponsored healthcare programs, are traditionally subject to increasing pressures in terms of reducing or controlling spending. These customers accounted for 38.5%, 26.7% and 36.1% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Therefore, given that the size and purchasing power of these parties allow them to obtain commercially advantageous conditions, it cannot be excluded that, in the event of renewal of the related contracts, we will be in the position of having to accept less favorable conditions than those currently negotiated. By reason of the absence of contractual regulation of the relationships with healthcare professionals and the various counterparties involved in the process, there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain these relationships in the future, selling our products to existing clients or selling them at the conditions applied as of the date of this offering memorandum. We establish relationships with surgeons and other medical professionals through providing instrument sets and the necessary training to use our implants. We also conduct trainings and provide instrument sets to medical schools, where we teach medical students how to use our instruments and implants, which helps facilitate relationships with new surgeons and strengthens relationships with medical school professionals. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our ability to conduct such trainings. While changing suppliers of orthopedic products could be labor-intensive and costly for many of our customers, our customers are not contractually committed to purchase any minimum quantity nor are they prohibited from terminating their relationships with us.

We devote substantial resources to R&D, but cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in developing profitable new products or improving existing products so that our products remain competitive and avoid obsolescence. In addition, whether successful or not, our R&D costs are significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business if we are unsuccessful in developing and producing competitive products that achieve market acceptance or the products do not perform as expected. In particular, we invest substantial resources into innovating our manufacturing capabilities, designing differentiated instrument sets and maintaining quality control systems in a highly regulated industry. There can be no assurance that our investments in these areas will result in increased profitability or that we will be able to maintain adequate levels of working capital or have funds available for future borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility in order to compete and innovate, as well to as meet our business’s other needs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, in the orthopedic implant industry, it is critical that a manufacturer provide surgeons and hospitals with a set of instruments that enables the surgeon to implant the orthopedic product. We are required to maintain significant inventory of instrument sets for consignment to our customers. These instrument sets are designed specifically for use with our products, and a surgeon generally cannot use another manufacturer’s instrument sets for a different implant. Instrument sets are provided free of charge to hospitals and surgeons, and typically last about 5 years before their components need to be replaced. In the event that a portion of our inventory becomes obsolete, the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. Concerns raised by regulators relating to our instrument sets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospect. As we continue to grow globally, our investments in instrument sets must increase in order to reach the new customers who buy our products. In addition, as we introduce new products, new implant and instrument sets may be required, which may result in a significant initial investment in order to support the launch of a product. Our Capital Expenditures related to instrument sets are significant and there is no guarantee that the costs we incur in designing and ordering new instrument sets will be repaid or covered by future sales.

Successful growth through future acquisitions is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions and integrate the acquired business into our Group. Such activities expose us to a number of risks. For example, there may be liabilities or asset impairments that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing acquisition-related due diligence investigations. Furthermore, even for obligations and liabilities that we do discover during the due diligence process, neither the valuation adjustment nor the contractual protections we negotiate may be sufficient to fully protect us from losses. If we make acquisitions, we may not be able to generate expected margins or cash flows, or to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including growth or expected synergies. In addition, the acquisition agreements we have already in place or that we may enter into in the future contain or may contain deferred consideration, which may impact our financial condition and future operating results. For example, our agreement with MT Ortho for our purchase of a branch of business operating as a going concern provides for us to make certain deferred payments depending on the revenues generated by certain MT Ortho products included in the acquisition. Our assessments of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets may prove to be incorrect, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. We may also incur unforeseeable and unexpected liabilities or contingencies relating to customers, employees, suppliers or other parties, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. It could also be more costly or not possible to successfully integrate the companies subject to acquisition or integration, both in terms of internal functions and production processes, and we may therefore be exposed to financial and operational risks and uncertainties, with possible adverse effects on our activities and prospects as well as on our economic and financial condition. 67 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The operation of our production plants and the transfer of data between our subsidiaries, distribution and service partners and financial institutions depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our IT system, which requires significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems. Further, IT systems are generally susceptible to disruptions, damage, power failure, computer viruses, hacking attempts by third-parties, fire and other events. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of our IT systems could have a material adverse effect on our business. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have implemented certain measures to protect ourselves against such events; however, operational breakdowns or interruptions of these systems may still occur and any such event could impair our ability to maintain our efficient production and supply processes and guarantee sufficient quality controls. As our manufacturing processes rely on a high level of automation, IT system breakdowns or interruptions could also lead to production stoppage, which in turn could result in lower revenue and unexpected costs.

Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the UK and the EU as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about the precise terms of the future relationship between the parties. This uncertainty has had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Lack of clarity about future UK laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate, could increase costs, disrupt supply chains, depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. Brexit could also result in the UK significantly altering its regulations affecting the certification of medical devices, which will result in additional costs and increased uncertainty as to any new conformity assessment procedures.

Our industry is characterized by significant litigation regarding patent rights. We do not always conduct independent reviews of patents issued to third parties. Third parties may, in the future, assert claims that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization, including claims from competitors or from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. As we continue to commercialize our implant systems in their current or updated forms, launch new products and enter new markets, we expect that competitors may claim that one or more of our implant systems infringe their intellectual property rights as part of business strategies designed to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technology involved, and the uncertainty of litigation may increase the risk of business resources and management’s attention being diverted to patent litigation. Moreover, as the initiation of such proceedings does not require the achievement of particularly high value thresholds, we may become party to future proceedings relating to our own patent portfolio or that of third parties, which could prove to be particularly costly and prolonged in time. Any litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial defense costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be required to pay substantial damages (which may be increased up to three times of awarded damages) or substantial royalties and could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to redesign our products in a way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Relating to Intellectual Property,13.2.2,We may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.,"The laws of certain countries, such as China, India, Turkey and Russia, do not offer robust protection of intellectual property rights, which may make it difficult to address infringement of foreign patents, where obtained, or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights. For example, certain countries limit patent protection against certain types of third parties, including government agencies or contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries. As a result, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. Any patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. In particular, following the entry into force of the Leahy-Smith Act America Invents Act and the implementing regulations promulgated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, inter alia: (i) it has been established in the United States the transition from a system of protection “first to invent” to a system of protection “first to file,” such that patent protection is granted to the first person to file the patent application, where the novelty of the invention compared to that of another subject is not important; and (ii) a special administrative tribunal such as the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (“PTAB”) has been established to provide a forum for any patent disputes. 69 ----- As of the date of this offering memorandum, we are unable to accurately predict the long-term impact of PTAB proceedings on our business, and it cannot be excluded that the availability of the PTAB as a lower-cost, faster and potentially more effective patent challenge court could result in an increase in the number of challenges and/or claims, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, the initial results of patent challenge proceedings before the PTAB since its inception in 2013 have resulted in the invalidation of many U.S. patent claims.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. Our standard practice is to seek patent protection for the intellectual property technical solutions relevant to our business, including our TT technology, as well as for the solutions relating to our technology platform. As of September 30, 2022, we owned 157 patents and had 155 patent applications pending. From time to time, we may be involved in patent disputes. Patent litigation and challenges involving our patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive us of market exclusivity for a patented product. For example, our patent relating to the TT technology was subject to litigation in the United States, which we successfully defended and prevailed in affirming the validity of our patent. As of the date of this offering memorandum, a similar legal challenge against our patent relating to the TT technology in Europe is pending. We intend to defend our TT technology vigorously and believe that we have valid defenses to these claims. Litigation involving our patents carries the risk that one or more of our patents will be held invalid or held unenforceable. An adverse court ruling could allow third parties to commercialize our products or use our technologies and then compete directly with us, without payment to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to achieve profitability. Our patents may not have, or our pending patent applications that mature into issued patents may not include, claims with a scope sufficient to protect our implant systems, any additional features we develop for our implant systems or any new products. Other parties may have developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our platform, may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive patents that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or devices or by claiming subject matter that could dominate our patent position. The patent positions of medical device companies, including our patent position, may involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, the scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. Proceedings challenging our patents could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application.

We are required to manufacture and market many of our products internationally, in compliance with statutes and regulations such as the EU Medical Devices Regulation, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) in the U.S., and the implementing regulations of the relevant government agencies. In order to demonstrate compliance with the applicable requirements and obtain the right to sell our products, we must undergo authorization, certification and other assessment procedures, which varies according to the type of medical device, its classification and the market in which our products is going to be sold. Moreover, we are required to implement an effective quality management system, which affects, inter alia, product design, production, documentation, personnel training and qualification, handling, storage, distribution and installation of medical devices. Our orthopedic implants and devices that we market in the U.S. are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or approval of a premarket approval (“PMA”), from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, before a device may be marketed, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally-marketed “predicate” device, which includes a device that has been previously cleared through the 510(k) process, a device that was legally marketed before May 28, 1976 (preamendments device), a device that was originally on the U.S. market pursuant to an approved PMA and later down-classified, or a 510(k)-exempt device. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the process of obtaining PMA approval, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. 71 ----- Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally require FDA approval. Similarly, certain modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k) clearance. Both the PMA and the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but can last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA. In addition, a PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical trials. Despite the time, effort and cost, a device may not be approved or cleared by the FDA. Subject to the transitional provisions and in order to sell our products in EU member states, our products must comply with the general safety and performance requirements of the EU Medical Devices Regulation, which repeals and replaces the Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the European Conformity (“CE”) mark to our products, without which they cannot be imported to, sold or marketed in the EU. All medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and – where applicable – other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. A conformity assessment procedure, depending on the risk class of the medical device, requires the involvement of a notified body. The notified body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we would not be allowed to affix the CE mark to our products, which would prevent us from selling them within the EU. The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA. Non-compliance with the above requirements would also prevent us from selling our products in these three countries. Following the end of the “Brexit” transitional period, from January 1, 2021, the MHRA became responsible for the UK medical device market. The new regulations require medical devices to be registered with the MHRA (but manufacturers were given a grace period of four to 12 months to comply with the new registration process) before being placed on Great Britain market. Manufacturers based outside the UK need to appoint a UK Responsible Person to register devices with the MHRA in line with the grace periods.

The U.S. government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of medical device manufacturers. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; - The U.S. federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act; - The U.S. federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier; - The U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which, in addition to privacy protections applicable to healthcare providers and other entities, prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; - The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act which requires certain applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under certain federal healthcare programs, to monitor and report to CMS, certain payments and other transfers of value in cash or in kind to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician providers (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives), and teaching hospitals, to report annually ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members; - The FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices, and regulates device marketing; - U.S. federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm customers; 73 ----- - Analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws requiring device companies to comply with specific compliance standards, restrict payments made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, and report information related to payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers; and - EU and other foreign law equivalents of each of the laws, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Though we have not experienced such issues, it is possible that governmental authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. We could be adversely affected if regulatory agencies determine our financial relationships with our customers and physicians to be in violation of applicable laws. Due to the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, and the range of interpretations to which they are subject, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws. To enforce compliance with the healthcare regulatory laws, certain enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time and resource-consuming and can divert management’s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement.

Any modification to these systems that has not been previously cleared may require us to submit a new 510(k) premarket notification and obtain clearance, or submit a PMA and obtain FDA approval before implementing the change. Specifically, any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer’s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have made modifications to 510(k)-cleared products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals were not required. We may make modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMA applications for modifications to our previously cleared products for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

The notified body will then assess the planned changes, determine the need for additional audits and verify whether the planned changes affect the products’ ongoing conformity with the EU Medical Devices Regulation. If the assessment is favorable, the notified body will issue a new certificate of conformity or an addendum to the existing certificate attesting compliance with the general safety and performance requirements and quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the EU Medical Devices Regulation.

The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of the implant. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the Regulators could take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearance, seizure of our products or delay in clearance of future products. The Regulators have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The regulators’ authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations. Depending on the corrective action we take to redress a product’s deficiencies or defects, regulators may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new marketing authorizations or certifications for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such clearances, approvals or certifications may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties or civil or criminal fines. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to regulatory authorities. We may initiate voluntary withdrawals or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of applicable regulatory authorities.

If the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance or imposition of an untitled letter, which is used for violators that do not necessitate a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. We could face similar consequences from action by foreign regulatory bodies when offering our products outside the United States. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws, if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government health care programs and the curtailment of our operations. In addition, physicians may misuse our products or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability.

However, such policies may be insufficient or our employees may not adhere to their letter and spirit. If any of our personnel is found to have engaged in illegal or unethical acts, or we are found not to have taken effective steps to manage and mitigate the risk or to address allegations or findings, of inappropriate conduct in our business, this may damage our reputation, result in criminal, regulatory or civil sanctions, impair our ability to participate in business with national healthcare providers and payors and may result in formal or informal exclusions from such business, with material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In particular, in Italy, under the Legislative Decree 231/2001 (the “Decree 231”) on the administrative liability of legal persons, our Group companies may be held liable for certain crimes committed in Italy or abroad (including corruption, fraud against the State, corporate offenses and market abuse) in their interest or for their benefit, by individuals having a functional relationship with our Group companies, including directors, employees and third party agents. However, pursuant to Decree 231, a defense can be established by an entity involved in a Decree 231 proceeding and liability can potentially thus be excluded if it can prove that it had adopted and properly implemented, prior to the commission of the crime, an organization, management and control model aimed at effectively preventing the commission of such criminal acts (“Model 231”). The suitability of the Model 231 is judicially determined ex post, on the basis of a concrete assessment of the existing facts and circumstances. We approved and adopted the Model 231 on March 31, 2011 (last updated in March 2022), and appointed a supervisory body (organismo di vigilanza) (the “Supervisory Body”) with continuous oversight of the Model 231, that monitors and assesses the implementation status of preventive measures and reports regularly to the Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not extended the adoption of the Model 231 to our subsidiaries and therefore, the Model 231 applies only to us and not to our foreign subsidiaries. Although we are currently evaluating the adoption of risk analysis procedures for our foreign subsidiaries, pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, and our Group has already adopted a Code of Ethics that is applicable to all our foreign subsidiaries. However, we have not yet implemented detailed controls and procedures for our foreign subsidiaries regarding export and sanctions regimes, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Failure to comply with Decree 231 could result in the imposition of criminal sanctions on our directors and employees and/or monetary sanctions, which would be determined by the judicial authority on the basis of a quota system, in proportion to our financial conditions, and of other types of sanctions (e.g., interdictory sanctions, including disqualifications, prohibitions, confiscation of the price or profits deriving from the crime and 78 ----- publication of the judgment) and loss of confidence of our customer base as well as render us ineligible to participate in a public tender or result in the termination of a public contract already awarded, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As part of our business activities, we are required to comply with the laws and regulations applicable in the countries in which we operate on anti-corruption matters – including, for example, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 (the “Bribery Act”), the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (“OECD”) Anti-Bribery Convention – which, inter _alia, prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering or making improper payments (or giving anything_ of value) to government officials and/or persons in the private sector or commercial partners for the purpose of influencing them or intending to obtain or retain business or an advantage in the conduct of business on its behalf. Our activities expose us to the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments or other financial or other advantages by one of our employees, associated persons or our agents that could be in violation of applicable anti-corruption laws. In 2014, in the U.S., we introduced the current internal control system (i.e. integrated compliance) by setting out general principles and application guidelines and also established a policy concerning the selection of our commercial partners (as well as a complex procedure for the compliance assessment of the latter). Although we have policies, procedures and internal controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will protect us from governmental investigations or inquiries surrounding actions of our employees or any agents or distributors that we might use or, in the past, have used. In the future, there may be allegations of employees or agents acting in a way that is in contravention of our requirements in relation to bribery, competition and third-party partners and it is possible that such allegations might emerge in relation to past conduct, in any case potentially resulting in major reputational and financial damage to the business. In addition, allegations of instances of misbehavior on the part of former agents, current or former employees or others acting on our behalf or on the part of public officials or other third-parties doing or considering business with us could emerge. While we endeavor to monitor such press reports and investigate matters that we believe warrant an investigation in keeping with the requirements of our compliance program, and if necessary make disclosures to relevant authorities, any adverse publicity that such allegations attract might have a negative impact on our reputation and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business practices.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, standards, or perception of their requirements may have on our business. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing our processing of personal data could result in negative publicity, government investigations and enforcement actions, claims by third parties and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial condition. As our operations and business grow, we may become subject to or affected by new or additional data protection laws and regulations and face increased scrutiny or attention from regulatory authorities. In the U.S., HIPAA imposes, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, which govern the privacy, processing and protection of health-related and other personal information. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach 79 ----- litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) recently passed in California. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA and will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Similar laws have passed in Virginia, and Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The enactment of such laws could have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. In the event that we are subject to or affected by HIPAA, the CCPA, the CPRA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition. We are subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”), which went into effect in May 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States; in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU (“CJEU”) limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EU/EEA to the United States by invalidating the Privacy Shield for purposes of international transfers and imposing further restrictions on the use of standard contractual clauses (SCCs). The European Commission issued revised SCCs on June 4, 2021 to account for the decision of the CJEU and recommendations made by the European Data Protection Board. The revised SCCs must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021; existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022. The new SCCs apply only to the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and not the UK. The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office has published new data transfer standard contracts for transfers from the UK under the UK GDPR. This new documentation will be mandatory for relevant data transfers from September 21, 2022; existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the new documentation by March 21, 2024. There is some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to non-EEA entities subject to the GDPR. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the SCCs cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results. Failure to prevent an incident or event, including a cybersecurity incident or other data breach, could amount to a breach of the GDPR. Non-compliance with the GDPR requirements can result in significant penalties (up to the higher of €20 million or 4% of total annual global turnover), as well as litigation, compensation claims by affected individuals (including class action type litigation where individuals suffer harm), regulatory investigations, and enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data, which may have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition, expose us to legal and regulatory costs, and impair our reputation and goodwill. In addition, compliance with the requirements of the GDPR may increase our legal, compliance, and operational costs. We are constantly working to ensure compliance with the requirements set forth by the GDPR and we are continuing to implement measures in order to map all the risks and to improve data protection. However, there can be no assurance that all GDPR measures have been fully and correctly implemented or that the relevant data protection authorities' view on the level of compliance will coincide with our views. This could in turn result in penalties, orders and/or claims against us which could have a material adverse effect of our reputation and/or on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, since the beginning of 2021, after the end of the transition period following the UK’s departure from the European Union, we are also subject to the UK data protection regime, which imposes separate but similar obligations to those under the GDPR and comparable penalties, including fines of up to £17.5 million or 4% of a noncompliant company’s global annual revenue for the preceding financial year, whichever is greater. The relationship between the UK and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the UK, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the UK without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision 80 ----- will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews or extends that decision. In September 2021, the UK government launched a consultation on its proposals for wide-ranging reform of UK data protection laws following Brexit and the response to this consultation was published in June 2022. There is a risk that any material changes which are made to the UK data protection regime could result in the European Commission reviewing the UK adequacy decision, and the UK losing its adequacy decision if the European Commission deems the UK to no longer provide adequate protection for personal data. Other foreign jurisdictions, such as China and Russia, are increasingly implementing or developing their own privacy regimes with complex and onerous compliance obligations and robust regulatory enforcement powers. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Furthermore, because the technologies used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage or disrupt, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. Even if identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our and our service providers’ employees who are (and may continue to be) working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. We and certain of our service providers are from time to time subject to cyberattacks and security incidents. While we do not believe that we have experienced any significant system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss, corruption or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets, personal information or other proprietary or sensitive information or other similar disruptions. If a security breach or other incident were to result in the unauthorized access to or unauthorized use, disclosure, release or other processing of personal data, it may be necessary to notify individuals, governmental authorities, supervisory bodies, the media and other parties pursuant to privacy and security laws. Any security compromise affecting us, our service providers, strategic partners, other contractors, consultants, or our industry, whether real or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures and lead to regulatory scrutiny. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or systems, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary or personal information, we could incur liability, including litigation exposure, penalties and fines, we could become the subject of regulatory action or investigation, our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our products and services could be delayed. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our business. Further, our existing insurance policies may not cover, or may cover only a portion of, any potential claims related to security breaches to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all or any portion of liabilities that may be imposed. 81 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The actual tax rates applicable to us in the future could be affected by a wide range of factors, including possible changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We are also exposed to possible tax assessments in numerous jurisdictions and to the risk that the relevant tax authorities disagree with any interpretation of the legislation as adopted by us and consequently challenge the amount of tax paid. We are exposed to the risk that any provisions made in the financial statements may not be sufficient to cover the costs of any tax assessment proceedings and penalties. Although we believe that we have acted in compliance with current legislation and that our estimates are reasonable, we are subject to the risk that, should claims be made by the competent tax authorities, any provisions made in the financial statements will not be sufficient to cover the final outcome of such claims and the related dispute, with consequent negative effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, the existence of numerous commercial and financial transactions between Group companies residing in different countries for tax purposes may result in the competent tax authorities applying transfer pricing regulations (instead of the criterion of agreed consideration). These regulations provide for the criterion of the ""arm's length value"", i.e. a price determined, also on the basis of estimates made by us and our subsidiaries, in accordance with the arm's length principle for the purposes of correctly allocating the taxable base to each of the companies involved in these intercompany transactions and belonging to the same corporate group. While we believe that we have operated in full compliance with national and international rules and principles on transfer pricing, as defined by the OECD as a whole, since the regulations on this subject are complex and potentially subject to different interpretations by the authorities of the various countries, there can be no guarantee that the methods and conclusions reached by us and our subsidiaries are always fully shared by each of these authorities. Therefore, there is a risk that, in the event of an audit by the tax authorities, disputes may arise on the fairness of the transfer prices applied in intragroup transactions between Group companies resident in different countries, which could lead to the request for higher taxes and possibly the application of administrative 82 ----- sanctions pursuant to applicable regulations, with possible negative effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

On February 3, 2020, we submitted our observations pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 7, Law No. 212 of July 27, 2000, with reference to the PVC received, asking the Italian Tax Authority (Agenzia delle Entrate) to acknowledge the unfoundedness of some findings contained in the PVC and, consequently, not to proceed with the issuance of the notices of assessment, reserving the right to produce further briefs and to initiate a possible contradictory discussion with the Italian Tax Authority. On January 11, 2023, the Italian Tax Authority proceeded on the matter and sent us an invitation to settle by paying an amount equal to approximately €3.2 million in taxes and reduced penalties, as well as approximately €0.6 million of interest for late payment (calculated up to January 24, 2023) in a tax settlement procedure to be held on January 31, 2023. As of the date of this offering memorandum, it is not possible to make any assessments or forecasts regarding the outcomes of the aforesaid tax settlement procedure, but it is possible that the Italian Tax Authority will issue a notice of assessment if a tax settlement agreement is not reached. Moreover, if a tax settlement agreement is not reached and an assessment is issued, we would expect to appeal the Italian Tax Authority’s assessment. It is possible that any appeals process may continue for several years before a final outcome is reached. Amounts requested by the Italian Tax Authority in the foregoing invitation to settle are determined on a provisional basis; should a tax assessment be issued, additional amounts in terms of penalties and interest would be requested. To the extent that we are subject to any resulting fines, we would seek to offset such fines against any available tax credits. It should also be noted that in 2019 a request for prior agreement on transfer pricing was submitted to the competent office of the Italian Tax Authority, concerning the prior definition of the methods (proposing the use of the Transactional Net Margin Method – TNMM) for the definition of the “arm’s length value,” within the scope of the sales of finished products by us to our subsidiaries.

In particular, acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the European Union (including Italian) and acquisitions of interests by persons or entities not belonging to the European Union that entail the acquisition of at least 10% of the voting rights or share capital (provided that the value of investments is equal to at least €1 million) must be reported to the Office of the President of the Council of Ministers for the possible exercise of the veto right or the application of conditions; acquisitions that exceed the 15%, 20%, 25% and 50% voting rights or share capital thresholds are also subject to the reporting obligation. Starting from January 1, 2023, acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the European Union are subject to the Italian Golden Power Legislation only if related to companies holding operating in the defense and national security, communications energy, transport, healthcare, agri-food and financial sectors. In the defense and national security sector, the relevant threshold is more than 3% voting rights or share capital for both European Union and non-European Union investors. Resolutions, acts or transactions approved by a company holding assets and relationships in strategic sectors that give rise to changes in the ownership, control or possession of such assets, including the enforcement of securities over the shares / assets, or in the use or purpose thereof must also be reported within ten days, and in any case prior to their implementation, to the Office of the President of the Council of Ministers. As a result, our ability to pursue commercial or industrial strategic resolutions, acts or transactions that involve, by way of example, the acquisition of, or the subscription for, our shares by a partner (or that imply an 83 ----- amendment to our shareholders’ structure) may be impacted by the exercise by the Italian Government of its special powers under the Italian Golden Power Legislation. On a more general note, if any of the companies forming part of the Group is involved in any transaction, act or resolution falling within the scope of the Italian Golden Power Legislation, the Italian Government may veto or impose conditions in order to consent to the implementation of such transaction, act or resolution, which may, in each case, be material. Accordingly, we may not be permitted to undertake such transaction, act or resolution in a timely fashion, without remedies or undertakings, or at all. Therefore, the Italian Golden Power Legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Furthermore, in the future, our shareholders’ ability to enter into change of control or takeover transactions relating to shareholdings in our share capital may be impacted by the exercise by the Italian Government of its special powers under the Italian Golden Power Legislation. Our shareholders may not be able to transfer their interests or such a transfer may be subject to conditions, which diminish the value of the transaction and discourage investments.

Our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory, technical and other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and our other debt agreements and other agreements we may enter into in the future.

In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such noteholders. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the enforcement sale of any Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other indebtedness secured by such collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the recovery from an enforcement sale. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain hedging obligations or the holders of any permitted additional indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interest of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant Security Documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (attribution _conventionnelle_ _(pacte commissoire)) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined (by reference to the date of enforcement) either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a precontractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral and whether or not the secured creditors are able to sell the Collateral for its full value as determined by the expert. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Meeting of Holders of Notes,” the majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of Notes will be one or more persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders of the Notes, including holders of Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the quorum requirements relating to meetings and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and change the amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of Notes and may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.

The measures of insolvency for the purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred the debt: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of its assets; 97 ----- - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. We cannot be sure as to what standard a court would apply in making a solvency determination or that a court would conclude that the Issuer was solvent immediately after the issuance of the Notes. Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests granted to secure the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors or by operation of law under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security _and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for further information._ If challenged successfully, the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. For a description of fraudulent conveyance and similar laws in other jurisdictions where the Guarantors are organized, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ In addition, Italian insolvency laws and regulations have recently been replaced by a new crisis and insolvency code – introduced by virtue of, among others, Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 (as subsequently amended and supplemented, the “Italian Insolvency Code”, also known as Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency) – being a comprehensive legal framework regulating, among others, insolvency matters.

In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender.","The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of control” of the Issuer. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default, or acceleration of the debt, under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, PIK Loan Agreement and agreements governing our other indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of events constituting a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PIK Loan Agreement or our other indebtedness may not constitute a change of control under the Indenture, and vice versa, and certain of the negative covenants under the PIK Loan Agreement may be more 98 ----- restrictive than those under the Indenture. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a change of control offer could cause a default under our other indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The source of funds for any repurchase required will be available cash or cash generated from operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity or funds provided by subsidiaries. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our subsidiaries’ then existing debt instruments. If we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated net leverage ratio of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met. The definition of “change of control” in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. Moreover, in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture, we will be required to commence an asset disposition offer (as defined under the Indenture) to all holders of the Notes pursuant to which we will be obligated to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will also have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of the Notes (provided that such price shall not be less than 100% of the principal amount).

A further deduction of interest expense in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30% of fiscal EBITDA of a company (i.e. risultato operativo lordo della gestione caratteristica) (“ROL”) determined according to tac rules for the calculation of the corporate income taxable base. The amount of ROL and interest income exceeding interest expenses not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expenses in a fiscal year can be carried forward, respectively for the following five fiscal years and without time limits. Net interest expense not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward and deducted in the following fiscal years, provided that and to the extent that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income is lower than 30% of ROL. The carried forward ROL, determined according to accounting rules under the previously applicable limitation provision could be offset only with interest expenses incurred on loans granted before 17 June 2016, to the extent that their maturity and their total amount committed have not been changed as of that date. In the case of an Italian tax group, interest expense not deducted by an entity in the Italian tax group due to lack of ROL can be deducted at the tax unity level, within the limit of the excess of ROL of the other companies within the Italian tax group. Our ability to deduct interest expense in respect of the Notes and other indebtedness incurred by companies within the Group will therefore depend on the ROL and our ability to have tax group arrangements. Any delay in the effectiveness of a tax group will impact the ability to deduct interest expense. The failure to achieve such a tax group could adversely impact our ability to use ROL to offset interest expense, including, inter alia, in respect of any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, there can be no assurance that in the case of a tax audit, the relevant tax authorities would not try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with the component of any financing used, in whole or in part, to refinance an outstanding loan or debt, when the terms and conditions of the refinancing transaction appear less favorable than the ones of the previous financing transaction. In particular, in such circumstances, the relevant tax authorities could argue that the interest expenses arising from such financing do not relate to the business of the borrowing entity (as the relevant transaction is deemed to be “antieconomic” and as such not compliant with the “inherence” principle set out under Italian tax law). Moreover, (i) any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation or application (including any future limitation on the use of the ROL of the Issuer and its subsidiaries), or (ii) the tax treatment of interest expense arising from any indebtedness, including the Notes, the failure to satisfy the applicable legal requirements relating to the deductibility of interest expense or (iii) a change in the interpretation and application by Italian tax authorities of Italian tax law may result in our inability to fully deduct our interest expense, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition. The tax deduction of a negative item of income (interest expenses included) may also be denied under the Italian anti-hybrid mismatch rules laid down in Article 6 and ff. of Legislative Decree 29 November 2018, no. 142 (“Decree 142/2018”), which transposed into national law the EU Directive 2016/1164 (ATAD 1) as amended by the EU Directive 2017/952 (ATAD 2).

A hybrid mismatch outcome may occur in the following cases: (i) the interest expenses are tax deductible in Italy and in another jurisdiction (double deduction, “DD”); or (ii) the interest expenses are tax deductible in Italy and the corresponding interest income is not included in the taxable income of the payee jurisdiction (deduction without inclusion, “D/NI”); or (ii) the payment directly or indirectly funds deductible payments giving rise to an hybrid mismatch (imported mismatch).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

On December 8, 2015, Estonia indicated that it would no longer be a Participating Member State. The Commission’s Proposal is still pending before the Council of the EU and its status is regularly discussed at the European and Financial Affairs Council. Moreover, in the course of 2020, the European Commission brought to the attention of the Council of the EU and the EU Parliament the possibility to propose, by June 2024, the introduction of a reshaped EU FTT as a new EU own resource. The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and, if introduced in its current form, could apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Under the Commission’s Proposal, the EU FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes provided that at least one party to the transaction is established or deemed established in a Participating Member State and that there is a financial institution established or deemed established in a Participating Member State which is party to the transaction, acting either for its own account or for the account of another person, or acting in the name of a party to the transaction. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State. The Commission’s Proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may, therefore, be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate and/or other Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. If the Commission’s Proposal or any similar tax were adopted, transactions in the Notes could be subject to higher costs and the liquidity of the market for the Notes may be diminished.

In 2002, we developed the Shoulder Modular Replacement (“SMR”) system, which is one of the leading modular shoulder platforms on the market. We are pioneers in 3D printed implants, with decades of experience underlying our proprietary TT technology. In 2015, together with a team of surgeons, we developed the Physica system, an innovative total knee replacement concept. - _Passion and care to people: We are committed to advancing patient-centered care through the development of better digital and hardware solutions. We work in collaboration with a host of respected medical research centers, hospitals and key opinion leaders (“KOLs”) globally to adapt and innovate our product lines. Our success is made possible by our employees, their motivation and passion, and our strong cultural heritage. Prosthetic implants, which we develop with patients in mind, are only the final step in a long process of design, development, advanced manufacturing and quality control. - _Design and engineering heritage: Over 75 years after our founding in 1945, our commitment to precision and quality remains. We combine deep expertise and passion for design, which allows us to achieve excellence in advanced manufacturing, as underscored by our commitment to precision test every product that we manufacture. Our innovation is grounded in decades of manufacturing expertise, creative talent and clinical research. 108 ----- - _Global footprint and broad customer base: We have a global footprint, serving customers in 51 countries through 26 subsidiaries with a strong local management team and distributors covering the remaining 25 countries.

We carry a broad product portfolio of orthopedic implants, focusing on product lines that offer relatively higher value in terms of expected market growth. We specifically focus on what we identify as high value-add products, namely products for the extremities segment (shoulder and elbow), hip and knee “revision” implants (which replace existing implants, as opposed to “primary,” i.e. first-time implants), ProMade custom solutions manufactured for revision and other complex primary surgeries and Trabecular Titanium 3D printed devices. We operate in the large and attractive global orthopedic implants market, underpinned by strong fundamentals, valued at approximately $45.5 billion in 2019 and project to grow even further. According to 109 ----- industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company, the shoulder, knee and hip implants market in our key markets, the U.S., Italy, Germany, the UK, Australia, Japan and France totaled approximately $13.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.0% to 1.5% from 2019 to 2025. ###### Shoulder, Knee and Hip Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2007-2025 ($Bn) _Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._ Our market is expected to continue benefitting from favorable structural tailwinds, including the following: - **Demographic factors: Demographic factors such as aging of the global population, increased levels of chronic diseases, rising levels of obesity worldwide (affecting younger and younger populations) and active lifestyles, particularly in advancing years, as well as sports-related and other injuries, lead to greater wear on joints and higher rates of degenerative diseases, which tends to support greater spending in the orthopedics market. - **COVID-19 backlog: Due to the characteristics of a “product of need” and the importance of orthopedic devices in treating patients suffering from injuries to bones and joints or supporting soft tissue injuries, the global orthopedic market historically has proven to be resilient, including during the recent global financial crisis and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significantly, there is pent-up demand in the global orthopedics market as a result of the postponement of a large number of non-emergency and elective procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe will contribute to increased spending in the orthopedics market over the medium-term until the demand for non-urgent procedures has been absorbed. - **Growth in high-value segments: The extremities market (particularly for shoulder implants, which is one of our core product lines), which generally benefits from higher profitability as compared to other segments, is growing faster than the overall global orthopedic implants market, with joint prostheses being the fastest growing segment at a CAGR of approximately 5.0% to 5.5% between 2019 and 2025 (according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company) and some key geographical areas growing even faster. For instance, the orthopedic implant market for joints in Australia, one of our strongest geographies in APAC, was forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 3.0% to 3.5% between 2019 and 2025 (according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

We invest substantial time, effort and financial resources into research and development to maintain a rich pipeline of innovative and marketable proprietary products. We undertake research and development 110 ----- spending across all product lines, with a particular focus on shoulder, knee and elbow products, as well as our own custom-made ProMade unit. As of December 31, 2021, our research and development team consisted of approximately 140 professionals with long-lasting experience and educational degrees in mechanical engineering, biomedical, aerospace, materials science, and physics. We believe that we are at the forefront of medical device technology, having invested €15.3 million, €16.3 million and €18.0 million in R&D (capitalized and expensed) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our research and development initiatives have targeted growth in high-value segments (i.e., segments within the market which benefit from relatively higher profitability) involving significant complexity, contributing to our strong profit margins for the periods under review. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 55.4%, 54.4% and 54.0% of our revenue were derived from what we refer to as high value-add products involving significant technical complexity, namely: - products for the high-growth extremities segment, which, for the year ended December 31, 2021 represented 35.3% of our revenue (excluding TT 3D printed products and custom implants, which are accounted for under a different product line), compared to 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 34.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019; the shoulder market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.0% to 5.5% from 2019 to 2025, according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company; - hip and knee revision implants, which, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we estimate represented 6.8% of our revenue (excluding TT 3D printed products and custom implants), compared to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019; based on our experience in the market, this type of product is generally priced 30% higher than primary implants due to its inherent complexity; - custom implants, which represented 1.7% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019; this market, in which we hold a leading position thanks to our ProMade products, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8% to 12% 2019 and 2025, according to industry and market data analyzed by a global management consulting company; and - our TT 3D printed differentiated technology, which generates higher profit margins compared to our standard products and represented 11.6% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We plan to continue growing our presence in these segments. Our differentiated 3D printed TT implants position us to benefit from the shift to outpatient clinics and ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”) (mainly present in the United States) for less complex, routine orthopedic procedures, a trend that has been further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe we are well prepared for the shift toward ASCs and we are in the process of developing pilot offerings with ASC-based surgeons and managers (for example, the streamlining of trays (part of our instrument sets) and co-marketing initiatives).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Product Mix** **Geographic Mix Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.3,"COVID-19 Pandemic and Recovery, Macroeconomic Condition","The years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 were marked by the impact of COVID-19. Having experienced strong year-on-year revenue growth in 2019, our revenue continued to grow strongly during the first two months of 2020 as compared to the corresponding prior-year period, until our operations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic mostly in terms of a decrease in revenue resulting from postponement of surgeries, particularly in public health structures, especially in those countries where healthcare is managed by local governments (e.g., Eastern Europe). Elective surgeries decreased in the early stage of the pandemic (March and April 2020), as hospitals were required to reserve intensive care beds for COVID-19 patients. When the first wave of the pandemic subsided during the summer of 2020, we experienced a significant sales recovery, with third quarter sales outperforming those of the same period in 2019. However, as a result of the second wave of the pandemic, which coincided with the onset of autumn, hospitals were forced to reduce (if not to fully suspend) elective surgeries in order to handle the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This caused a further slowdown in our sales, although more limited that at the beginning of 2020. This slowdown had a greater impact in Italy than in the other countries in which we operate, mainly due to the different approaches to addressing the pandemic in various countries. We continued to be largely affected by these lockdowns until the end of the first half of 2021. 111 ----- Partially offsetting the negative impact of the contraction in sales, our management implemented a structural review of costs, maximizing the transition to digital, cancelling virtually all in-person trade shows, workshops and sector conventions, and capitalizing on the opportunity offered by the critical juncture to adopt a new model which benefits our profitability and contributes to our employees’ work-life balance. Where possible, we benefited from employment support measures introduced by local governments in response to the COVID-19 emergency, such as the dedicated furlough scheme (Cassa Integrazione Guadagni) adopted for 18 weeks between March and July of 2020 in Italy, which significantly supplemented the government measures and allowed us to fully reimburse our employees for compensation which was temporarily reduced during the period. In addition, our management team contributed to these efforts by accepting a reduction of their salaries in solidarity with furlough scheme adopted in 2020 and 2021. Between January and June 2021, we took advantage of an additional furlough scheme in Italy (Cassa Integrazione Guadagni) and reimbursed 50% of affected employees’ salary reductions during the period. Lastly, following COVID-19-related government initiatives, some of our branches received medium-term subsidized loans during the year that have now all been repaid. While our revenue decreased 12.9% from €222.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to €194.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, it later increased 9.7% to €212.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The strong performance in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 reflects surgery volumes recovering to, or otherwise surpassing, pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels in most of the geographies in which we operate, and increasing orders following postponements and cancellations of surgeries. Our continued return to normality post-COVID-19 has been further supported by the demand for our products resulting from the backlog of non-emergency and elective procedures which were postponed, as, among other factors, (i) hospital capacity and healthcare resources were significantly re-routed to deal with patients suffering from COVID-19, (ii) many hospitals and healthcare providers placed restrictions on the number and type of non-emergency and elective procedures performed at their facilities, and (iii) many candidates for such procedures preferred to minimize their exposure to clinical settings for fear of contracting COVID-19. For example, as of February 2022, the British National Health Service estimated that 6.0 million people were on the waiting list for planned service delivery, up from 4.4 million prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-urgent medical procedures in the United States were also significantly disrupted, with providers in some parts of the country, such as Texas and Florida, banning elective surgeries in 2020. We believe there is significant pent-up demand for our products as a result of the lockdowns that restricted elective procedures across our markets. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we estimate such backlog to amount to over €60.0 million of sales for our business over the medium-term. As the capacity of healthcare facilities and providers returns to, or exceeds, pre-COVID levels, we believe this backlog will be absorbed over the next few years, resulting in a de-risking of a significant portion of our future revenue growth. During the pandemic, we continued to invest in the growth of our business. We purchased a significant amount of instrument sets (totaling €32.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021) and manufactured inventory while continuing spending on the development of new products (thereby increasing our working capital), which we believe will yield customer conversions and further growth in the business. As a result, we believe that we are well-invested and prepared to tackle the post-COVID-19 rebound of sales, with resources readily available to be deployed into the market. We are already seeing the benefits of our preparedness to take advantage of this backlog, with revenue increasing by 16.2% to €180.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from €155.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (despite the continued impact of COVID-19 on APAC, which is still recovering from ongoing governmental COVID-19 responses (particularly in Australia, New Zealand and Korea) and a continued slow-down in elective surgeries as a result). We expect our Net Working Capital to normalize over the medium-term, resulting in a trend towards pre-COVID19 levels of Net Working Capital, and in particular of days sales outstanding (“DSO”) and days inventory outstanding (“DIO”), as we are able to sell inventory (and quicken the receipt of payments from our customers post-pandemic) which we continued to procure during the pandemic in expectation of the post-pandemic sales rebound. See “—Net Working Capital.” Supported by our continued focus on new customer conversion, sales force expansion and new instrument sets deployment, we also gained additional market share (as estimated by comparing our revenue growth against publicly available reporting of top-line sales figures of our peers), growing above our peers in the market (recording revenue growth of 12.7% between the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022 as compared to our top four competitors’ top-line sales figures growing at 6.0%, 6.5%, 1.2% and 3.5% over the same period, respectively). Moreover, we experienced improving Cash Conversion of 72.0% for the nine months ended 112 ----- September 30, 2022, compared to 47.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, supported by an overall decrease in Net Working Capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Demand for our products and our cost base may also be influenced by general macroeconomic economic conditions. In times of economic downturn, we could experience lower demand and a more challenging market environment for our product offerings resulting from a general decline in consumer and business confidence, increased unemployment and difficulties experienced by third party payors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to _Our Industry and Business—Our business may be negatively affected by changes in international economic conditions.”_ Nevertheless, as of the date of this offering memorandum we have not been materially affected by the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022. We control a significant proportion of our value chain, from machining to finishing, coating, clean room and packaging, allowing for efficient cost management and production flexibility. We source a limited number of products from dependable third-parties located primarily in Italy, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, including certain raw materials (principally titanium, titanium powders, polyethylene and ceramic) and ancillary semi-finished components and as of the date of this offering memorandum, have not experienced supply chain disruptions in 2022. We have benefited from a strengthening of the U.S. dollar since the invasion of Ukraine, due to a large portion of our revenues being denominated in U.S. Dollars and a majority of our costs being incurred in euro. Our energy and power supply (industrial) costs have also not been a material component of our cost of production, amounting to €2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and €1.2 million, €1.3 million and €1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We also maintain a partial ability to pass on raw material cost inflation to customers (primarily third-party distributors).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

We have a global network which provides a footprint in the local markets where our subsidiaries are present, offering proximity to the most attractive markets for the development of the healthcare sector and potential patients, operating in five main geographical segments: Europe (excluding Italy), Italy, APAC, the United States and the Rest of the World with sales in over 50 countries. Until the early 1990s, most of our revenue was generated in Italy. Since then, we have grown and continue to grow the percentage of revenue generated outside of Italy, with revenue generated in Italy decreasing from 21.4% of revenue in 2019 to 19.8% of revenue in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 37.1% of revenue was generated in Europe (excluding Italy), 19.8% in Italy, 18.0% in APAC, 16.6% in the United States and 8.4% in the Rest of the World. We intend to further penetrate the high-value U.S. market by expanding our existing product offering, which is currently focused on our higher-priced and higher-margin shoulder implants. To further grow our market share in the United States, we intend to further expand our product offering and address the evolutionary trend toward new ambulatory surgery centers, and the demand for cost-efficient outpatient procedures for less complex, routine orthopedic needs. The U.S. market is generally characterized by higher prices for healthcare products as compared to other geographies such as Europe, and as such, we are able to charge higher prices for our products in the region, contributing to higher margins. We believe that further expansion in the U.S. will therefore be margin-accretive and beneficial to our results.

We have historically entered into and expect to continue to pursue such strategic acquisitions that complement or enhance our existing products. We have sought to strategically invest in niche specialty products where attractive opportunities arise that could complement our organic growth strategy and/or complete or enhance our product portfolio in key geographies and where we believe we have significant 114 ----- expertise in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions while remaining focused on our financial performance. _TechMah Medical LLC_ In September 2018, our U.S.-based subsidiary, Lima USA acquired TechMah, a company that specializes in software for medical devices and focuses on digital technologies for orthopedic surgery. The acquisition of TechMah enabled the addition of software expertise to our own 3D printing know-how. In particular, we funded TechMah and supported the development of its digital solutions dedicated to orthopedic surgery. TechMah did not generate revenue in the three-year period from 2018 to 2020, due to its investments in the development of digital technology for the shoulder guidance, which received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in March 2021. The shoulder guidance product is currently in the Controlled Release phase. TechMah was fully consolidated from the year ended December 31, 2018 using the anticipated acquisition method. The consideration for the acquisition amounted to $38.0 million (€33.2 million at EUR/USD exchange rate as of December 31, 2018), structured as follows: - initial cash consideration of $7.0 million (€6.1 million at the EUR/USD exchange rate as of December 31, 2018); - deferred cash consideration (in the form of capital contributions) of $8.0 million (€6.9 million at the EUR/USD exchange rate as of December 31, 2018), paid in instalments in 2018, 2019 and 2020; - further contingent consideration in the form of cash and shares of the Issuer, paid upon the completion of certain milestones, amounting to $10.9 million (€9.5 million at the EUR/USD exchange rate as of December 31, 2018); - further contingent consideration in the form of cash and shares of the Issuer, paid upon the completion of certain performance milestones (i.e. the number of surgical operations performed), amounting to $12.2 million (€10.6 million at the EUR/USD exchange rate as of December 31, 2018). As of September 30, 2022, outstanding contingent consideration relating to the TechMah Acquisition amounted to €8.8 million.

Our portfolio includes four main product lines: extremities, knee, hip and other products. Moreover, our ProMade product line permits us to provide custom implants for patients with complex orthopedic needs. Our strategy is focused on high value-adding products, including extremities products. Our revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, after an initial decrease in the year ended December 31, 2020 attributable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which many healthcare providers and hospitals deferred or otherwise limited non-emergency surgeries. Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased as compared to our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 showing a continued post-COVID-19 rebound, especially in Europe and the United States. Despite this latest revenue growth trend, we operate in a competitive industry and, depending on the product and geography, face varying degrees of pressure to reduce our selling prices, and we expect such pricing pressure to continue in the future. While average selling prices for hips and knees have generally been declining globally at low-single-digit annual rates, we believe we can offset these declines by focusing on extremities, where pricing is more stable (particularly, shoulder products), by tilting our geographical sales mix towards high-margin countries (such as the U.S) and through product innovation across the portfolio. Innovation is primarily responsible for an underlying shift from more commoditized products (like standard hip and knee implants) to more specialized products made using advanced technologies and materials like our proprietary Trabecular Titanium (“TT”) technology. These factors directly translate into higher average selling prices levels as well as an increase in after-surgery service. Given our strong position in niche markets such as shoulder and revision surgeries, where price pressure is expected to be less intense, as well as our proven innovation capabilities, differentiated TT technology, and recent acquisitions of high-profile products, we believe we are favorably positioned within the current pricing environment. Accordingly, we endeavor to continue to innovate and introduce new products. We rely on a steady pipeline of new products in various stages of concept, design and market release. As of December 31, 2021, we had 10 products in the concept stage (four extremities products, two knee products, one hip product and three digital products) and 21 products in the development stage (10 extremities products, six knee products, two hip product and three digital products). Four products were released in the market/launched in 2022, and eight products are expected to be in 2023. In addition to the traditional product lines, we also offer bespoke products across all product lines which are consolidated in ProMade. ProMade implants are designed and manufactured using computer aided design and additive manufacturing technologies for exclusive patient needs with high level of surgical complexity across hip, shoulder and knee. Custom-made products are required in severe and complex cases like cancer patients, revision and especially in re-revision operations since the removal of primary and revision implants can cause bone and tissue damage, making more sophisticated and complex implants necessary. The development of customized implants and instrument sets require advanced research and development capability, resulting in higher price points and ultimately higher profit margins. We do not currently report revenue attributable to ProMade separately, but we account for such revenue under the main product line the custom-made product belongs to.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Our Capital Expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 amounted to €38.5 million, €47.0 million and €37.0 million, respectively, and amounted to €37.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. During the period under review, we made a proactive decision to sustain investment in our business to foster growth acceleration post-pandemic. These expenditures have left us well-invested, with sufficient inventory and capacity to capitalize on the post-pandemic rebound in sales activity. We purchased a significant amount of instrument sets (totaling €32.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021) and manufactured inventory while continuing spending on the development of new products (thereby increasing our working capital), which we believe will yield customer conversions and further growth in the business. We believe there is significant pent-up demand for our products as a result of the lockdowns that restricted elective procedures across our markets. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we estimate such backlog to amount to over €60.0 million of sales for our business over the medium-term. We expect that our investments position us to benefit from the short-term rebound in procedures due to clearing of the backlog from deferred surgeries during the COVID-19-related shutdowns and further expect our Capital Expenditures to normalize at a lower level over the medium-term. We are already seeing the benefits of our preparedness to take advantage of this backlog, with revenue increasing by 16.2% to €180.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from €155.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (despite the continued impact of COVID-19 on APAC, which is still recovering from ongoing governmental COVID-19 responses (particularly in Australia, New Zealand and Korea) and a continued slow-down in elective surgeries as a result). Our Capital Expenditures amounted to €122.5 million between 2019 and 2021, of which (i) €47.4 million was linked to investments in instrument sets (which we expect to drive incremental revenue), (ii) €36.0 million was used on property, plant and equipment, primarily to expand production capacity via new production and manufacturing machinery, including new 3D printing facilities and a grey room plant, (iii) €19.2 million was linked to the TechMah acquisition between 2019 and 2021 and (iv) €19.9 million was related to expenditures on other intangibles, comprising start-up and expansion costs, R&D, development and costs related to patents and intellectual property rights not otherwise attributable to TechMah’s integrated end-to-end digital surgery platform (“Smart SPACE”). For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our investments were aimed at implementing further growth and classified as Growth Capital Expenditures (i.e., discretionary expenditures) while the remaining 20% consisted of maintenance investments and classified as Maintenance Capital Expenditures, in line with approximately 80% and 20% for the year ended December 31, 2020. In the medium term, we expect to benefit from our previous investments in our platform and to gradually reduce our Growth Capital Expenditure as a result of the long life of the instruments sets deployed and the expected increase in turn per sets. As such, we expect our yearly Maintenance Capital Expenditures over the medium-term to amount to approximately €5-8 million, in line with historical levels, and our yearly Growth Capital Expenditures to remain in the range of 5-10% of sales (with Growth Capital Expenditures trending towards the lower end of this range assuming the completion of our discretionary expansion of production capacity at our Villanova di San Daniele site in 2024, including a distribution center and additional manufacturing plant capacity). Part of our targeted investment approach is accelerating growth and increasing handling efficiency through management of instrument sets. Our total capital expenditures in instruments sets amounted to €14.9 million, €17.4 million and €15.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and amounted to €14.0 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. We believe investment in instrument sets is a key element to increase sales in the orthopedic industry. We design and outsource the purchase of instrument sets that we supply surgeons on a consignment basis with our prostheses. Different instrument sets are developed and supplied with our various products and product lines. Investing in our bespoke instrument sets differentiates our products and services from our competitors, and we believe enhances our relationships with surgeons. We believe that the supply of our instrument sets to surgeons and hospitals has a positive impact on our sales. 116 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Although our reporting currency is euros, 49.4% of our revenue was generated in euros as a result of our global sales approach, and 50.6% of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than euros for the year ended December 31, 2021, in particular U.S. dollars (16.6%), Japanese yen (5.8%), Australian dollars (5.8%) and pounds sterling (5.3%). In connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, the results of operations and financial position of each of our consolidated subsidiaries, which are initially prepared in each subsidiary’s functional currency, are translated into euro. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate at the end of the relevant reporting period, and income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year/period (as applicable). Specifically, we are subject to currency risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than subsidiaries’ functional currency, thus affecting profit or loss for the year (transaction risk), as well as the currency risk resulting from the translation of subsidiaries’ financial statements in currencies other than euro, affecting our consolidated profit or loss for the year and consolidated equity (translation risk). Certain of our subsidiaries are located in Australia, Japan, the UK and the United States, whose functional currencies are the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, respectively. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates of these currencies against the euro from one period (as applicable) to the next impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position and, depending on the magnitude of these fluctuations, could obscure underlying trends that would have been apparent if our Consolidated Financial Statements had been prepared on a constant currency basis. To the extent that such subsidiaries have a reporting currency other than the euro, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be greater.

It is updated at each reporting date for the effects of the year-on-year calculation of the contingent consideration. _Hospital for Special Surgery_ Our U.S.-based subsidiary, Lima USA Inc., signed an agreement with the Hospital for Special Surgery (the “HSS”) in January 2019 for the production of implants on hospital grounds. Jointly with HSS, we announced the creation of the first additive manufacturing 3D printing facility for custom complex implants in a hospital setting. We opened the ProMade Point-of-Care (“PoC”) Center in March 2021 at the HSS’s main campus in New York City, for the 3D printing of custom complex implants in a hospital setting. The first surgery using 3D printed implants manufactured at the PoC was carried out in April 2021. 115 ----- The collaboration with the HSS did not generate revenue in the three-year period, as we focused on creating the ProMade PoC Center. The collaboration however enabled us to lay the groundwork to strengthen and expand ProMade, identified as a high value added product, particularly in the United States which we consider one of the most profitable markets.

Additionally, such expenses impact both our total revenues and income as well as assets recorded on our balance sheet, as such expenses predominantly comprise the cost of in-house capitalized tangible assets, mainly instrument sets. For such reason, cost of materials on revenue for the periods under review should be considered jointly with changes in work-in-progress, semi-finished and finished goods and with the increase recorded in assets relating to the in-house production of instrument sets. Expenses are recognized when goods and services are sold or consumed during the year or by systemic allocation, or else when it is not possible to identify the timing of their future use. _Services: Services comprises primarily (i) commissions and charges based on a percentage of accrued_ commissions up to the ceiling set by Enasarco, paid into the Enasarco pension fund (the supplementary fund to which commercial agents and representatives must register (“Enasarco”)), (ii) consultant-outsourced processing, analysis and administrative services, (iii) insurance, maintenance, utilities, travel costs and workshop costs, (iv) transport costs and (v) royalty fees relating to the use of third-party patents. _Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods: Change in work-in-progress,_ semi-finished products and finished goods refers to charges related to the change in inventory of such items. 117 ----- _Personnel expenses: Personnel costs comprise the expenses related to wages and salaries, social security_ contributions, post-employee benefits and other related costs. _Amortization and depreciation: Amortization and depreciation includes depreciation of right-of-use_ assets and comprises the amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and depreciation of leased assets. _Bad debt provision and other impairment losses: Bad debt provision includes the accrual for net_ impairment losses on trade receivables recognized pursuant to IFRS 9.

We believe the fundamental drivers of our business remained unchanged even during the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. continued demand due to demographic factors and the role of orthopedic devices as a “product of need” with inelastic demand. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we continued to take advantage of the backlog in demand resulting from delayed procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued to focus on new customer conversion, sales force expansion and the deployment of new instrument sets, which allowed us to increase our revenues (recording significant organic growth as compared to our revenues for the equivalent preCOVID-19 period in 2019) and capitalize on the opportunity to gain market share. We experienced positive sales performance in most of our sales geographies, with Europe (including Italy) leading such growth and recording a 19.9% increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. We also recorded a strong rebound in U.S. revenue, with revenue growing by 20.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Rest of the World sales also increased by 18.9% as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by a doubling of our sales in Brazil. Our sales in APAC decreased slightly, still recovering from ongoing governmental COVID-19 responses (particularly in Australia, New Zealand and Korea) and a continued slow-down in elective surgeries as a result. Notably, we recorded organic revenue growth in all of our product lines, with the largest percentage increase attributable to our knee segment, complemented by continued strong organic growth in our extremities segment.

The increase in revenue, despite the impact of novel COVID-19 strains, was driven by strong double-digit organic growth in our Italian, European and Latin American (captured within our Rest of the World geographical segment) geographies, and to a lesser extent, growth in our United States and APAC geographies, as sales rebounded globally post-pandemic as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 notwithstanding ongoing COVID-19 governmental responses and a continued slow-down in elective surgeries in APAC. 121 ----- We believe the fundamental drivers of our business remained unchanged even during the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. continued demand due to demographic factors and the role of orthopedic devices as a “product of need” with inelastic demand.

Despite the material impact to our sales in the first few months of 2021, revenue recovered significantly in the second half of the year as a result of accelerating vaccination efforts in our sales geographies and returned to pre-COVID-19 levels.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from service recharges linked to the rise in turnover and sales, as well as an increase of other income and other revenue. _Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods_ Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods increased by €2.4 million, or 6.0%, to €42.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to €39.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was driven primarily by our higher sales for the period, resulting in higher purchases of 119 ----- finished goods, as well as increased purchases of raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods to rebalance inventories. Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods, as a percentage of revenue, represented 23.4% and 25.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. _Services_ Services increased by €13.1 million, or 27.8%, to €60.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to €47.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, driven by higher turnover and processing fees and an increase in transport costs as a result of higher sales and management remuneration in connection with the step-down of our former CEO Luigi Ferrari. Services, as a percentage of revenue, represented 33.4% and 30.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. _Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods_ Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods increased by €0.4 million to €2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to €1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods, as a percentage of revenue, represented 1.3% and 1.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. _Personnel expenses_ Personnel expenses increased by €11.7 million, or 26.2%, to €56.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to €44.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase is primarily due to higher wages and salaries paid as compared to the prior period. Personnel expenses represented 31.2% and 28.7% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. _Amortization and depreciation_ Amortization and depreciation increased by €2.5 million, or 10.6%, to €26.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to €23.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was driven primarily by the increased amortization of intangible assets (with such assets being put into service in 2021) related to the acquisition of TechMah, mainly due to the impact of foreign exchange movements. Amortization and depreciation, as a percentage of revenue, represented 14.5% and 15.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. _Other impairment losses_ Other impairment losses increased by €0.8 million, to €0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to €0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily caused by the impairment of certain product development costs. Other impairment losses, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.5% and 0.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. _Other operating costs_ Other operating costs increased by €0.3 million, to €1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to €0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher sundry costs from previous years, gifts and donations (i.e. charitable giving) and other costs, partially offset by losses on assets. Other operating costs, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.7% and 0.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 120 ----- _Internal work capitalized_ Internal work capitalized decreased by €1.9 million, or 15.7%, to €10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to €12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Internal work capitalized, as a percentage of revenue, represented 5.7% and 7.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. _Financial income_ Financial income increased by €14.6 million to €19.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to €5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, mainly due to increased exchange gains and financial income from the adjustment of liabilities to fair value in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Financial income, as a percentage of revenue, represented 11.0% and 3.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. _Financial expenses_ Financial expenses increased by €3.3 million, or 22.4%, to €18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to €14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, mainly due to increased exchange losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Financial expenses, as a percentage of revenue, represented 10.0% and 9.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. _Income tax benefit (expense)_ Income tax expense increased by €0.6 million to an expense of €0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to an expense of €0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This income tax expense was attributable to increased pre-tax income. Income tax expense, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.4% and 0.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. _Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin_ Adjusted EBITDA increased by €1.0 million, or 2.2%, to €47.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from €46.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was attributable to increased sales as compared to the prior period, which more than offset a return to pre-COVID-19 levels of spending in medical education and marketing. Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased by 3.6 percentage points, to 26.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from 29.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease was attributable to increased spending in medical education and marketing in line with pre-COVID-19 levels, as well as increased travel costs (albeit not at pre-COVID-19 levels due to the increased prevalence of remote/digital events across the industry).

We believe the fundamental drivers of our business remained unchanged even during the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. continued demand due to demographic factors and the role of orthopedic devices as a “product of need” with inelastic demand. We entered the year with strong revenue momentum, recording strong organic sales growth in the first two months of 2020, and experienced an additional rebound in the summer months of 2020 when initial lockdowns were lifted in many of our sales geographies which was eventually offset by the proliferation of the pandemic later in the year. We demonstrated earnings resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, with our revenues declining by 12.9% between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, which was less than the approximately 15% to 20% decline in our (weighted) key markets of the U.S., Italy, Germany, the UK, Australia, Japan and France (according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we continued to focus on new customer conversion, sales force expansion and the deployment of new instrument sets, which we believe provided us with a base to increase our revenues in the periods that followed and capitalize on the opportunity to gain market share.

We were additionally able to decrease expenditures on raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods for the period due to increased existing inventory as a result of our prudent decision to continue investment during the year ended December 31, 2020, which positioned us to take advantage of the expected post-pandemic backlog of demand for our products. Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods, as a percentage of revenue, represented 25.1% and 31.0% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 122 ----- _Services_ Services increased by €7.7 million, or 12.4%, to €69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to stable travel and marketing expenses resulting from the maintenance of cost savings initiatives put in place during the pandemic. These savings were offset by higher commercial, consulting and outsourcing costs and sales commissions, which grew in line with increased revenues. In particular, (i) Enasarco pension commissions and charges increased by €1.2 million, or 5.2%, to €23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020; (ii) consultant-outsourced processing, analysis and administrative services increased by €4.3 million, or 34.4%, to €17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020; (iii) insurance, maintenance, utilities, travel costs and workshop costs increased by €1 million, or 8.7%, to €12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020; (iv) transport costs increased by €0.3 million, or 5.2%, to €5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €5.1 million for the year ended December 31,2020; and (v) royalty fees relating to the use of third-party patents decreased by €0.1 million, or 4.4%, to €0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Services, as a percentage of revenue, represented 32.9% and 32.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. _Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods_ Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods decreased by €9.8 million, or 82.7%, to €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the post-COVID rebound in sales which occurred during the course of the year ended December 31, 2021. Change in-work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods, as a percentage of revenue, represented 1.0% and 6.1% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. _Personnel expenses_ Personnel expenses decreased by €2.4 million, or 3.8%, to €60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the delay of new hirings, lower bonuses and the partial maintaining, especially at the beginning, of cost saving measures for COVID-19. Personnel expenses represented only 28.6% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 32.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020. _Amortization and depreciation_ Amortization and depreciation increased by €2.9 million, or 9.8%, to €32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Amortization and depreciation for the period consisted of (i) property, plant and equipment line items totaling €20.5 million, comprising land and buildings, plant and equipment, industrial and commercial equipment and other assets (ii) amortization of intangible assets amounting to €7.4 million; and (iii) depreciation of leased assets of €4.6 million. The €2.9 million increase compared to the prior period was driven primarily by the amortization of intangible assets (with such assets being put into service in 2021) related to the acquisition of TechMah. Amortization and depreciation, as a percentage of revenue, represented 15.3% and 15.3% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. _Bad debt provision_ Bad debt provision decreased by €0.2 million, or 33.5%, to €0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was the result of an improved quality of the receivables portfolio and in turn, a lower provision for impairment losses. Bad debt provision, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.2% and 0.3% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 123 ----- _Other impairment losses_ Other impairment losses decreased by €0.3 million, or 59.3%, to €0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was caused by a reduced requirement to impair the value of intangible and tangible assets compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Other impairment losses, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.1% and 0.3% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. _Other operating costs_ Other operating costs decreased by €0.2 million, or 10.3%, to €1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven primarily by a decrease in other miscellaneous operating fees and accruals costs. Other operating costs, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.7% and 0.9% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. _Internal work capitalized_ Internal work capitalized decreased by €2.2 million, or 11.7%, to €16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to management’s focus on only deploying instrument sets in strategic markets to support a post-COVID sales rebound. Internal work capitalized, as a percentage of revenue, represented 7.6% and 9.5% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. _Financial income_ Financial income increased by €4.8 million, or 158.9%, to €7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to €3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to a higher value of unrealized exchange gains and fair value gains on deferred financial debt. Financial income, as a percentage of revenue, represented 3.7% and 1.6% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. _Financial expenses_ Financial expenses decreased by €7.6 million, or 26.8%, to €20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to lower realized and unrealized exchange losses. Financial expenses, as a percentage of revenue, represented 9.8% and 14.6% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. _Income tax benefit (expense)_ Income tax benefit decreased by €5.8 million, or 333.4%, to a loss of €4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of €1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was driven by both an increased amount of taxable income and a larger accrual of deferred taxes. Income tax benefit, as a percentage of revenue, represented 1.9% and 0.9% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. _Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin_ Adjusted EBITDA increased by €11.4 million, or 22.1%, to €63.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from €51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was attributable to increased sales (including sales of high-margin products) as compared to the prior period (which was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic), especially as a result of increased sales in the second half of the year as a result of the lifting of lockdown measures and reduction of the COVID-19 pandemic in many of markets. 124 ----- Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 3.3 percentage points, to 29.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 26.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was attributable to swift action taken by management in advancing savings initiatives for the period, such as price negotiation initiatives and channel cost savings that we implemented by lowering travel and medical conference costs during the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which contributed to our profitability.

This increase was mainly due to the contributions for about €1.4 million received from local governments to sustain businesses and employment during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. _Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods_ Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods increased by €1.9 million, or 3.3%, to €60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by increased purchases of raw materials and semi-finished products, despite our decreased sales volumes, and by the higher prices and irregularities of component purchases. Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods, as a percentage of revenue, represented 31.0% and 26.1% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. _Services_ Services decreased by €12.4 million, or 16.6%, to €62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €74.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly due to lower commissions, fairs and marketing events, as well as travel expenses due to restrictions set about by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, (i) Enasarco pension commissions and charges decreased by €3.6 million, or 13.8%, to €22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019; (ii) consultant-outsourced processing, analysis and administrative services increased by €1.7 million, or 15.4%, to €12.6 million for the year ended December 31 2020 compared to €10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019; (iii) insurance, maintenance, utilities, travel costs and workshop costs decreased by €4.4 million, or 28.3%, to €11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019; (iv) transport costs increased by €0.2 million, or 3.3%, to €5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019; and (v) royalty fees relating to the use of third-party patents decreased by €0.1 million, or 12.1%, to €1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

This increase was primarily due to the increase in inventory in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior period due to decreased sales during the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a buildup of inventory. Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods, as a percentage of revenue, represented 6.1% and 3.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. _Personnel expenses_ Personnel costs decreased by €1.3 million, or 1.9%, to €63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of various measures adopted to counteract the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The €4.2 million decrease compared to the prior period, driven primarily by a lower value of intangible assets amortization. Amortization and depreciation, as a percentage of revenue, represented 15.3% and 15.2% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. _Bad debt provision_ Bad debt provision decreased by €0.4 million, or 41.0%, to €0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to increased receivables recovery efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bad debt provision, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.3% and 0.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. _Other impairment losses_ Other impairment losses increased by €0.4 million to €0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, other impairment losses comprised mainly of write-downs due to the withdrawal of two projects within the Group.

Other operating costs, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.9% and 1.1% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. _Internal work capitalized_ Internal work capitalized increased by €2.8 million, or 17.6%, to €18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was due to an increased investment in instrument sets to sustain our post-COVID-19 business recovery and to prepare for the expected post-pandemic sales rebound. Internal work capitalized, as a percentage of revenue, represented 9.5% and 7.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. _Financial income_ Other financial income decreased by €2.0 million, or 39.8%, to €3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to €5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly due to lower value of unrealized exchange gains. Financial income, as a percentage of revenue, represented 1.6% and 2.3% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. _Financial expenses_ Financial expenses increased by €6.9 million, or 32.3%, to €28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was due to the combined effect of lower financial charges, mainly related to the update of the valuation at fair value of outstanding payments related to the TechMah transaction, and higher realized and unrealized exchange losses. 127 ----- Financial expenses, as a percentage of revenue, represented 14.6% and 9.6% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. _Income tax benefit (expense)_ Income tax benefit decreased by €0.3 million, to €1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to an income tax benefit of €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by a lower amount of taxable income and higher amount of deferred taxes. The positive effect (benefit) in 2019 was due to the combined effect of more current taxes (due to higher recorded sales) and accrued tax benefits from prior periods. In 2020, the increase was due to higher current tax expense. Income tax benefit, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.9% and 0.9% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. _Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin_ Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €5.8 million, or 10.1%, to €51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €57.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to decreased sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused mobility restrictions and lockdowns and disruptions of healthcare systems globally primarily resulting in the postponement of a large number of non-emergency and elective procedures, as, among other factors, (i) hospital capacity and healthcare resources were significantly rerouted to deal with patients suffering from COVID-19, (ii) many hospitals and healthcare providers placed restrictions on the number and type of non-emergency and elective procedures performed at their facilities, and (iii) many candidates for such procedures preferred to minimize their exposure to clinical settings for fear of contracting COVID-19. Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 0.8 percentage points, to 26.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to swift action taken by management in advancing savings initiatives for the period, such as price negotiation initiatives and channel cost savings that we implemented by lowering travel and medical conference costs during the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which contributed to our profitability.

We held cash and cash equivalents of €19.5 million, €26.3 million and €21.5 million as of December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, we held cash and cash equivalents of €26.3 million, supported by our Existing Revolving Credit Facility. Historically, our principal sources of liquidity on an ongoing basis have consisted in cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings under credit lines, such as drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. Following the Offering, our principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash generated from our operating activities and available drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt, including the Notes.”_ For more information, please refer to our consolidated balance sheet and corresponding notes thereto in the Consolidated Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Our primary uses of cash are linked to working capital requirements, Capital Expenditures, payment of taxes and the making of interest payments on our indebtedness. Our business requires investment in working capital, which is susceptible to fluctuations, particularly as a result of inventory purchase patterns. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and our desired level of inventory. Historically, working capital requirements have been higher in the first half of the year as we increase our inventory levels in order to be able to timely meet customer demand in the second half of the year. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in our second half of the year. From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions to expand our product portfolio.

We believe we are well-positioned to maintain such cash flows over the medium-term, as continued investment into our business during the COVID-19 pandemic (reflected in our cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020), leaves us well-positioned to take advantage of the backlog of elective surgeries resulting from COVID-19-related delays, which we estimate at over €60.0 million of sales for our business over the medium-term. Going forward, we believe we will also be able to further optimize our cash flows used in our Capital Expenditures, as (i) we are subject to relatively limited Maintenance Capital Expenditures (ii) we are able to adapt Growth Capital Expenditures, which are inherently discretionary (for example, expenditures on new instrument sets and manufacturing facility expansions), to market conditions and (iii) we are able to benefit from significant capital investments undertaken in prior periods. In general, our cash flows were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as we recorded lower sales and therefore lower cash flows from operating activities at the height of the crisis (primarily the year ended December 31, 2020). In order to protect our cash flows, we implemented a number of savings initiatives, such as price negotiation initiatives with suppliers and channel cost savings that we accrued by lowering travel and medical conference costs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

(3) We calculate DIO (days inventory outstanding) as our inventories for the period divided by Cost of Goods Sold for the period, further multiplied by 360 (or 270 in the case of nine month periods) to approximate the number of days in a calendar year or period, as applicable. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant disruptions to ordinary course business practices across commercial industries, including the medical device industry. Beyond decreased sales as a result of delayed medical procedures, resulting in higher inventories across the industry, payment and delivery terms were extended for market participants, their customers and their suppliers, resulting in working capital increases as inventories remained on hand and as payables and receivables remained outstanding for relatively longer periods of time. In connection with the post-pandemic rebound in commercial activity across our industry, we are experiencing an encouraging normalization in our DSO and DIO, with the foregoing trending back towards their pre-pandemic 2019 levels, aided by increased sales in geographies with better payment terms, such as the United States. We also expect to similarly move towards normalizing our days payables outstanding (“DPO”) to pre-COVID-19 levels over the medium term. We expect these existing and expected normalization trends to continue for the foreseeable future, resulting in Net Working Capital as a percentage of sales aligning to pre-pandemic levels and contributing to further improvements to our cash generation. The decrease in Net Working Capital as of September 30, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 was driven by an increase in trade receivables for the period, in line with higher sales, partially offset by an increase in trade payables, and an increase in other current liabilities (primarily a result of the unwinding of a long-term incentive share plan arrangement with our outgoing chief executive officer). The increase in inventories for the period was in support of the post-pandemic sales rebound, with days sales outstanding (“DSO”) and days inventory outstanding (“DIO”) normalizing to pre-COVID-19 levels. Our Net Working Capital as of September 30, 2022 is in line with the seasonal cycle, decreasing in the second half of the year as we build-up in the first half of the year to ensure product availability in the later months. The increase in Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was driven by an increase in trade receivables as a result of higher sales, and increased inventories to support the thenexpected post-pandemic sales rebound. The increase in Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in inventories due to reduced sales during the COVID-19 pandemic (and the corresponding decision to maintain inventories), in each case in support of the then-expected post-pandemic sales rebound.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Historically, Capital Expenditures has comprised the additions to intangible assets (including start-up and expansion costs, R&D, development and patents and intellectual property rights) and the additions to tangible assets (land and buildings, plant and machinery and industrial and commercial equipment, including instrument sets). For our own internal purposes, we additionally segment our Capital Expenditures into: (i) Growth Capital Expenditures (i.e., discretionary expenditures), which we define as increases in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets which, in each case, are utilized to expand our business or to increase the long-term operating capacity of our assets or our operating income, for example, through the distribution of instrument sets to new customers or expenditures related to increasing our production capacity (including the addition of new manufacturing machinery such as 3D printers); and (ii) Maintenance Capital Expenditures, which we define as increases in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets which, in each case, are utilized to maintain the efficiency or increase the longevity of our capital assets, for example through the replacement of instruments within existing instrument sets or expenditures related to maintenance and repair of our capital assets. We believe that, in spite of the general economic fears and risks due to the COVID-19 outbreak, our sustained Capital Expenditures in 2020 highlighted our intentions to pursue our long-term development objectives through continuous investments in key growth drivers such as R&D and innovation, process and products digitalization, staff training and customer conversion. We believe our historical Capital Expenditures have left us well-invested, as continued investment into our business during the COVID-19 pandemic (reflected in our Capital Expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020) positions us to take advantage of the backlog of elective surgeries resulting from COVID-19-related delays, which we estimate at over €60.0 million of sales for our business over the medium-term.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we classified approximately 24% of our Capital Expenditures as Maintenance Capital Expenditures and approximately 76% as Growth Capital Expenditures. We have historically financed our Capital Expenditures through cash generated through our operations, cash on hand and financing from financial institutions, and expect to continue to finance our Capital Expenditures in a similar manner in 2022. In the medium term, we expect to benefit from our previous investments in our platform and to gradually reduce our Growth Capital Expenditure as a result of the long life of the instruments sets deployed and the expected increase in turn per sets. As such, we expect our yearly Maintenance Capital Expenditures over the medium-term to amount to approximately €5-8 million, in line with historical levels, and our yearly Growth Capital Expenditures to remain in the range of 5-10% of sales (with Growth Capital Expenditures trending towards the lower end of this range assuming the completion of our discretionary expansion of production capacity at our Villanova di San Daniele site in 2024, including a distribution center and additional manufacturing plant capacity).

The use of such estimates and assumptions affects the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the information disclosed. Actual results for those areas requiring management judgment or estimates may differ from those recorded in the financial statements due to the occurrence of events and the uncertainties which characterize the assumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based. The primary areas applicable to our Group that involve greater subjectivity in making estimates and where a change in the conditions underlying the assumptions could have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements include the items discussed below. For further information, please see the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements provided elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. _Depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets_ Property, plant and equipment (tangible assets) and intangible assets are shown at original historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses (if applicable). The cost of tangible assets and intangible assets is depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The economic useful life of the asset is determined at the time of purchase, based on historical experience for similar assets, market conditions and expected future events which may affect them, such as technological changes. The effective economic useful life may therefore be different from the estimated useful life. _Provisions for risks and charges_ Provisions for risks and charges are provided in respect of known or probable losses or liabilities whose timing and extent cannot be reliably determined at the year-end but an estimation of cost can be provided by management. Provisions for risks and charges are recognized when we have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and consequently, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation or transfer it to third parties at the reporting date. Where the effect of the discounting is material, the provisions are calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate that reflects the time value of money. If such discounting is performed, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a financial expense. _Provision for write-downs of receivables_ Receivables are recognized at the nominal amount, less provisions applied based on management’s estimation of the recoverability of the receivable. A provision for impairment of receivables is recorded when there are indications that the full carrying value of the receivable may not be recoverable. The provision covers the estimate of the risk of losses which derives from past experience with similar receivables, from the analysis of overdue receivables (current and historical), of losses and recoveries and finally from monitoring economic trends and forecasts both currently and prospectively to our business. _Impairment Test_ Pursuant to IAS 36, goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. With regard to testing goodwill for impairment, we identified a single operating CGU for our operations. We considered the sources of information set out by IAS 36 such as the fact that our management monitors the group’s performance and takes strategic decisions about its product offering and investments at group level. _Inventories_ Raw materials and packaging are measured at the lower of purchase cost and estimated replacement value based on market trends. The cost is calculated using the weighted average cost for the year. Semi-finished products and finished goods are measured at purchase or production cost, considering their stage of completion, or their realizable value based on market trends, if lower. The production cost includes the reasonably attributable portion of direct and indirect manufacturing costs. The resulting amount is written down through the allowance for inventory write-down to account for items whose expected realizable value is lower than their cost. 137 ----- _Revenue recognition_ Based on the five-step model introduced by IFRS 15, we recognize revenue after identifying the contract(s) with a customer and the performance obligations in the contract (transfer of goods and/or services), determining the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for fulfilling performance obligations (at a point in time or over time). Revenue is measured on the basis of the transaction price excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Based on our internal analysis of contracts with customers, we have not identified any performance obligations that are satisfied over time and, therefore, we recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of the promised goods or services to the customer. Revenue is measured to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to our group and the amount can be measured reliably. Revenue is adjusted for any discounts and volume rebates allowed by us in contracts with customers. Expense is recognized when the goods and services are sold or consumed during the year or by systematic allocation, or when it is not possible to identify their future use. Expense items are classified by nature in accordance with the applicable IFRS. 138 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The global orthopedic implants market is composed of the following segments: (i) joint reconstruction devices for full or partial replacement of the hip, knee and extremities (shoulder, elbow, hand/wrist, foot/ankle), (ii) spine devices, (iii) trauma devices, (iv) dental implants, (v) sports medicine devices, and (vi) craniomaxillofacial implants. The market has demonstrated historical stable growth and resilience, and growth in the coming years is expected to have continued support by a number of favorable underlying secular trends such as ageing population, increase in related diseases, more active lifestyle for younger population, technological innovation, and the shift to the outpatient setting. We are primarily active in three joint replacement segments: extremities (shoulder and elbow), knee and hip. The market is further broken down into primary procedures (first joint replacement) and revision procedures (replacement of a previously implanted device due to natural progression of the implant, trauma, or other causes). We also offer custom solutions for these segments, a highly specialized product category for patients with complex cases for whom off-the-shelf implants may not fit. Our key markets, the U.S., Italy, Germany, the UK, Australia, Japan and France, which together accounted for approximately 63% of our revenue as of nine months ended September 30, 2022, represented a total addressable market for shoulder, knee and hip of approximately $13.5 billion in 2019, as shown in the chart below, according to the analysis of a global management consulting company. 139 ----- ###### Shoulder, Knee and Hip Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2007-2025 ($Bn) _Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._ Our addressable market is large, resilient and has experienced stable growth over the last 15 years, and through times of economic crises, with a CAGR of 2.5-3.0% from 2007 to 2019. The growth trajectory in our key markets is expected to continue with a projected CAGR of approximately 1.0-1.5% from 2019 to 2025. Hip and knee are the largest and more mature segments of the market, with a CAGR of 1.0-1.5% and 2.0-2.5%, respectively, from 2017 to 2019. The hip segment is projected to grow at a CAGR of 0.1-0.5% from 2019 to 2025, while the knee segment is projected to grow at a CAGR of 0.5-1.0% over the same period. The shoulder segment, which is our key strategic focus area, is smaller (approximately 12% of total addressable market), yet fast-growing due to the currently lower penetration of shoulder implants and a higher rate of technological innovation compared to the hip and knee segments. Between 2017 and 2019, the shoulder segment recorded a CAGR of 9.0-9.5% and is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.0-5.5% from 2019 to 2025. In terms of geographical relevance, the U.S. represents the largest market globally for shoulder, knee and hip implants ($9.7 billion market value in 2019), driven primarily by the rise in elderly population, increased number of surgeries for younger patients and increases in safety and reliability of implant procedures coupled with favorable reimbursement policies. In Europe, Germany is the largest market (approximately $810 million in 2019), followed by the UK (approximately $615 million in 2019), France (approximately $550 million in 2019), and Italy (approximately $450 million in 2019).

J Surg Orthop Adv. 2010 Fall;19:174–176)._ 141 ----- In recent years, growth in procedure volumes has been partially offset by pressure on average selling prices (“ASP”) of orthopedic implants, driven by factors such as government cuts to healthcare spending, private payer reimbursement pressures and broader focus on cost containment. This trend has been particularly noticeable in the hip and knee segment of the market due to a higher degree of commoditization and larger volume of procedures. Pricing pressures have been less severe in our key segments: extremities, revision surgeries and custom implants.

However, we have already seen a quick rebound and we expect a further acceleration to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels of 2019 with further accelerated growth over the period from 2021 to 2023. The rebound is driven by the absorption of accumulated direct backlog from lockdown periods in 2020 and 2021, as well as a ripple effect of patients whose procedures were or are delayed due to the extended waiting lists during recovery. Orthopaedic conditions can be painful or limit the mobility of a person, but they are not usually life-threatening, and surgeries can be safely postponed (in favor of more urgent procedures); however, since patients still need to undertake the surgeries, these procedures are generally just delayed. We expect that COVID-19 pandemic will not have an overall structural impact on the orthopedic implants market, and the fulfilment of the backlog of postponed orthopedic procedures is expected to boost growth over the coming years. According to data analyzed by a global management consulting company, the market is expected to return to its long-term growth trajectory after 2024 when the COVID-19 pandemic related backlog is expected to be completely absorbed. ###### COVID-19 Pandemic Resulting in Postponed Surgeries and Followed by Backlog-Driven Catch-up in our Key Markets _Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._ The orthopedic market developments are different across geographical markets. In particular, Italy, the UK and France experienced stronger COVID-19 pandemic impact due to stricter and more prolonged lockdowns and COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions throughout 2020 and part of 2021, while the COVID-19 pandemic impact in the U.S., Germany, Japan and Australia was more moderate with respect to sales volumes of orthopedic implants. For example, the U.S. saw a moderate decline in revenue of 15-20% during 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic. We also believe and expect that elective surgeries that were deferred for reasons related to COVID-19 pandemic have resumed starting from the fourth quarter of 2021 as the healthcare system returns to full capacity in the U.S. In contrast, Italy and the UK saw a more severe COVID-19 pandemic impact with overall sales in 2020 down 35-40% and 46-47%, respectively. According to a global management consulting company, the recovery of the backlog in Italy and the UK is expected to have a positive impact from 2021 until beyond 2025, as patients surgeries postponed during COVID-19 pandemic lead to additional ripple effect in later years. 142 ----- In March 2021, the Italian Arthroplasty Registry (or “RIAP”), which is specialized organization within the Italian National Public Advisory Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità), who keeps a registry of joint replacement surgeries in Italy, published a report examining the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on elective surgeries in seven Italian regions through September 30, 2020 (source: Registro Italiano ArtroProtesi, Rapporto _ISS COVID-19 n. 7/2021 Rev – Impatto dell’emergenza COVID-19 sui volumi di attività della chirurgia protesica ortopedica in sette Regioni italiane, March 31, 2021). The study considered a statistically significant sample,_ representing approximately 40% of the total number of elective procedures performed in Italy. As shown in the chart below, the number of elective procedures performed in 2020 were significantly lower compared to the months of March, April, May, and June of 2019. As surgeries have been postponed but not cancelled, there has been a significant build-up of backlog which is expected to clear over time as COVID-19 pandemic cases reduce and capacity for elective procedures is restored. The number of procedures performed in August and September of 2020 have demonstrated the potential of such trend. As the number of COVID-19 pandemic cases reduced in 2020, the number of surgeries increased to levels well above 2018 and 2019 before being impacted by a new wave of COVID-19 pandemic cases. RIAP estimates that during 2020 approximately 135,000 elective orthopedic procedures were postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.

The shoulder market is expected to outgrow in terms of percent growth the more mature hip and knee implant markets due to currently lower penetration of shoulder implants. According to a global management consulting company, the shoulder market for our key geographies was valued at $1.6 billion in 2019. As the shoulder segment is not as developed and penetrated as the hip and knee markets, volume growth is significantly higher. The market grew at a CAGR of 9.0-9.5% from 2017 to 2019 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.0-5.5% from 2019 to 2025. The reverse shoulder sub-segment has the strongest growth (approximately 3 percentage points above the general shoulder market), driven by advancing technologies and improved patient outcomes, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.0-8.5% from 2019 to 2025. 143 ----- ###### Shoulder Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2017-2025 ($Bn) _Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._ The shoulder market suffered a less severe impact from COVID-19 pandemic due to its stronger underlying growth profile. Revenue declined by approximately 16-17% in 2020, however it is expected to return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic level starting from 2021 (according to data elaborated by a global management consulting company). Our plan is to retain our leading position and to strengthen our position in the fast-growing and attractive shoulder market in our key geographical areas. We believe that the future growth of our shoulder product sub-segment will be characterized by innovation, including the use of innovative technologies such as TT technology, and portfolio completion through ongoing product development. In particular, we have recently successfully launched new products such as (i) the SMR Hybrid Glenoid, (ii) the SMR Lateralized Connectors, (iii) the SMR Short Stem and (iv) the SMR TT Augmented 360 Glenoid. We have a strong focus and heritage in the shoulder segment and will continue to develop our leading platform with strong exposure to attractive reverse shoulder segment, focus on more complex cases with revision and custom-made implants. We have several products in development, including the Prima Short Stem (which is currently in the Controlled Release phase), the Prima TT glenoid and our Smart SPACE digital solutions for shoulder. Within these digital solutions, we plan to launch the Lima Patient Specific Instruments (the “LPSI”) during the course of 2023, as an improved solution that allows surgeons to autosegment CT scans, plan cases and design 3D positioners. We also plan to strengthen our position in the elbow segment with our modular TEMA (Total Elbow Modular Arthroplasty) Elbow system, the new system for Elbow joint replacement surgery characterized by modularity, convertibility and an innovative design, which is approved in the U.S. and Europe. _Large Joints (Hip and Knee)_ The knee implant market represents the largest segment within joint replacement (valued at $6.3 billion in 2019 in our key geographies), followed by the hip implant market (valued at $5.6 billion in 2019 in our key geographies). The mature knee and hip segments are projected to grow from 2019 to 2025 at a CAGR of 0.5-1.0% and 0.1-0.5% respectively. Within this market, our key focus is the revision implant segment, which is growing faster than the primary implant market and not commoditized, attracting higher margins, being more complex procedures. As a result, while pricing pressure is expected to remain over the coming years, these pricing pressures have been less severe in revision surgeries. 144 ----- ###### Knee Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2017-2025 ($Bn) ###### Hip Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2017-2025 ($Bn) _Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._ The large joints market was more impacted by COVID-19 pandemic compared to the shoulder segment due to its slower underlying growth profile. Market revenues for hip fell approximately 19-20% in 2020, while knee revenues experienced a 21-22% decline. Return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels is expected for 2022, initially boosted by the absorption of backlog for procedures that were postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to data elaborated by a global management consulting company, a normalization in market volumes for hip and knee is forecasted between 2022 and 2023 due to the reduction in backlog, followed by a return to the long-term trajectory starting in 2025. Our plan is to strengthen our position in the large joints segment and particularly in the knee segment and to further penetrate our key geographical areas by expanding our existing product offering in the hip and knee segments, supported by a track record of clinical outcomes. We plan to further develop our comprehensive and high-quality suite of implants for complex revision cases, which commands premium pricing due to higher complexity of the surgical procedure. Recent product launches in the knee segment include: (i) the 3D printed Anatomic Metaphyseal Fixation (“AMF”) TT Cones for complex primary and revision knee surgery and (ii) the new Physica VitE and LMC liners. A number of our new products leverage our proprietary Trabecular Titanium and 3D printing which will also allow us to command premium prices and continue to strengthen our position in our key markets.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

These establishments aim to grow into an attractive site for scientists, surgeons, and potential partners by representing opportunity for the orthopedic, industrial, and academic worlds. Our R&D team consists of approximately 140 professionals with significant experience and degrees in mechanical engineering, biomedical and aerospace engineering, materials science, and physics. We invest in R&D focusing on our strategic priorities. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our expenses attributable to R&D (capitalized and expensed) amounted to €15.3 million, €16.3 million and €18.0 million, respectively. 157 ----- Our internal R&D team works closely with key opinion leaders and a global network of physicians, medical personnel, R&D-oriented surgery centers and universities to ensure that we have broad access to best-in-class ideas and technologies. For example, in March 2021, the ProMade PoC Center at HSS, which we believe to be the first design and 3D printing facility for custom complex implants in a hospital setting, became operational. Agreements with universities include the services contract signed in March 2021 with Queensland University.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.3,Our Business Model,1241.3.2,Manufacturing,"We have a state-of-the-art, highly automated manufacturing set-up that provides high quality, precise and consistent manufacturing with a cost-competitive manufacturing footprint. We currently operate two production facilities in Italy, which have been audited by multiple notified bodies, as well as the FDA. In June 2018, we completed the expansion of our facility in Villanova di San Daniele. In addition, the new ProMade PoC Center, operated by us on the HSS main campus in New York City, became operational in March 2021. As a vertically integrated company, we are able to control the vast majority of the production chain, from machining to finishing, coating, clean room and packaging, which allows us to manage the quality and flexibility of production. Instrument sets are sourced externally as well as polyethylene components, ceramic components and knee femoral components for which our activities start with the cleaning process. The majority of our implants are manufactured internally following the various stages of the production process outlined in the chart below. Our manufacturing process typically start from casted or forged semi-finished components made of titanium or CoCr alloy which are processed through turning, milling and polishing processes. For these processes we mostly utilize computer numerical controlled (“CNC”) machines as well as polishing machines. In order to improve manufacturing efficiencies, cost and quality, we employ computer-assisted robots as well as automating certain manufacturing and inspection processes. Following the machining stage, products move to coating, where required, cleaning, packaging and sterilization. For our 3D printed products, we start directly from the powder which is used to manufacture the semi-finished components through a 3D printing process. These 3D printed semi-finished products then undergo the standard manufacturing process of the casted and forged semi-finished components. Certain products such as our TT cones do not require machining and coating thus going from the Additive Manufacturing stage to the Clean Room, thereby reducing production costs of those products. Our integrated manufacturing process enables us not only to act flexibly with a short lead time but also to ensure a consistent quality in our products while managing costs appropriately. As is customary in the orthopedic business, a portion of our product inventory is located at customers’ premises on consignment and available for customers’ immediate use. We normally ship a complete set of prostheses and the corresponding instrument sets to every surgeon and hospital that utilizes our products in their surgeries. In some countries, such as the U.S., each set of prostheses that we send on consignment generally contains two pieces for every individual product to provide backup. As surgeries are performed on a daily basis, customers send us a list of our products utilized during the course of that day and we process those orders for the corresponding replacement parts and 158 ----- send these within 24 hours. With regular monitoring of stock usage, we are able to quickly adjust our production to demand and manage our stock levels efficiently. Our manufacturing facilities meet all relevant medical device industry standards and are certified according to ISO 13485, the global standard for medical device quality systems ensuring high quality products, processes and related customer support. _Production Facilities_ We own two production facilities in Italy. The following table sets forth selected information about our production facilities, including manufacturing processes and main products produced at each location:",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.3,Our Business Model,1241.3.3,,"Our business model consists of the following phases: (i) Research and Development, (ii) Manufacturing, (iii) Procurement, (iv) Customers and Sales and (v) Medical Education. The following graphic sets forth the chronology of the sales of our products, from research and development to point-of-sale: 155 ----- - **Research & Development: Through our world-class in-house R&D team, we seek to remain at the forefront of innovation by developing new products and enhancing our current product portfolio. Our R&D team works side by side with our product marketing team and is focused on improving surgical outcomes by designing clinically differentiated products with cutting-edge technology for both primary and revision surgeries, with a particular focus on driving digitization in the orthopedic industry. With the ultimate goal of addressing unmet clinical needs, we often pursue multiple product solutions for a particular application in order to offer surgeons the options and flexibility to use their preferred procedural technique with the understanding that one solution does not work for every case. We have a dedicated team of engineers at our R&I Center and ATLAs in our headquarters in Villanova di San Daniele, Italy focused on hardware, as well as digital engineers at the Center of Excellence for Software in Knoxville, Tennessee, focused on the development of innovative technology solutions. The R&I Center leverages 3D printing expertise to accelerate the development of new and innovative orthopedic implant solutions. ATLAs engages in experimental verification and simulation of new and innovative materials, production processes and orthopedic solutions to better evaluate implants prior to market release. Both the R&I Center and ATLAs enhance the collaboration between all departments and surgeons, providing support to all aspects of new product development. These establishments aim to grow into an attractive site for scientists, surgeons, and potential partners by representing opportunity for the orthopedic, industrial, and academic worlds. - **Manufacturing: The design and manufacturing of implants takes place at our two state-of-the-art manufacturing sites in Italy in coordination with our global R&D team, with instrument set production partially outsourced where efficient. As a vertically integrated company, we are able to control the vast majority of the production chain, from machining to finishing, coating, clean room and packaging, which allows us to manage the quality and flexibility of production. Where appropriate, after receiving regulatory clearance or approval for our products to be sold without restriction, we conduct a limited distribution of our products, allowing us to trial new technology such as instrument sets with a select set of customers—this allows us to further gather practical feedback and make necessary changes to our products, such as to instrument sets, before launching products on a full scale (“Controlled Release”). - **Procurement: As a result of our vertically integrated production structure, we mainly purchase raw materials and certain semi-finished products from external suppliers and other minor services, such as sterilization. We also purchase the majority of our instrument sets from specialized third-party vendors. - **Customers and Sales: Our sales model allows us to meet the needs of our broad customer base. We have three types of customers: (i) public institutions, including hospitals (often organized in Group Purchase Organizations (“GPOs”), through tenders in certain countries), private clinics (also often organized in GPOs) and Ambulatory Surgery Centers (“ASCs”) which we serve directly and reach with in-market 156 ----- capabilities, (ii) distributors and (iii) other orthopedic companies. Our top ten clients represented approximately 10%, 11% and 9% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and our public institutions customers, including hospitals, represented 34%, 31% and 35% of our revenues for the year ended as of December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our direct sales force composed of sales representatives, non-stocking distributors, agents and sub-agents calls directly on public hospitals, private clinics and ASCs. In case of direct sales, we invoice the end-customers. We also leverage an indirect network of distributors, in selected markets, to whom we sell implants as well as, in most cases, instrument sets. The distributors then sell and invoice the end-customers. Finally, we have a few OEM customers to whom we sell components. - **Medical Education: We believe in offering surgeons more than a simple medical education course, but also access to a community. We support surgeons with their need for ongoing professional improvement by providing valuable learning opportunities. Each surgeon has different needs and different requirements and we tailor their education path to these needs through specific programs. This is a key driver in customer engagement, for both new customer acquisition and customer retention. Our medical education path includes traditional courses, SkillsLabs, which provide fundamental hands-on opportunities for surgeons and a particular curriculum for younger surgeons to develop the key opinion leaders of the future. Other unique opportunities we provide are called “Surgeon-to-Surgeon” training where experts in excellence centers host surgeons in their operating room and share their experience and knowledge on a specific topic. The different services we can provide which can support a surgeon directly in their operating room to face new or different cases are also key to our customer acquisition strategy. Our program “Reverse Surgeon-to-Surgeon,” aims to provide that service and we send an expert surgeon to work side by side with them, in their operating room offering direct proctoring during a case. In the operating room, customized instrument sets, cases and trays are provided to surgeons along with implants. We collaborate closely with surgeons to provide on-site training and support at each stage of the surgical process. We also conduct trainings at medical schools, which helps foster surgeons’ appreciation for our products and strengthens our cooperation with medical school professionals.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.4,Site** **Size (in m[2])** **Manufacturing Processes** **Manufactured Products,1241.4.1,Procurement,"As a result of our vertically integrated production structure, we mainly purchase raw materials and certain semi-finished products from external suppliers and other minor services, such as sterilization. We also purchase the majority of our instrument sets from specialized third-party vendors. We believe we have a well-balanced and dependable supplier base (as of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not experienced supply chain disruptions in 2022), primarily concentrated in western Europe. _Raw materials and Semi-Finished Products_ Our principal raw materials are titanium, titanium powders, polyethylene and ceramic. The principal semi-finished products we source externally are forged products, casted products and instrument sets components. We value our strong relationships with suppliers and we have worked to establish closer ties with the key ones to ensure high quality services and products, as well as cost efficiency. Our top five suppliers of raw materials and semi-finished products accounted for 75%, 75% and 77% of our total costs of materials and raw materials in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, but no supplier accounted for more than 23%, 21% and 23% of purchases. Costs of materials and semi-finished products represented only 14%, 17% and 16% of our total costs of sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and have therefore only limited impact on sales. More than two-thirds of our costs of materials (including instrument sets) are denominated in euro with the remainder in foreign currencies, primarily U.S. dollars and New Zealand dollars. All raw materials are sourced from selected companies located mainly in Italy, France, Germany and UK, which ensures, we believe, high quality control over the supply chain. We generally do not enter into long-term commitment contracts with our suppliers; rather we typically enter into framework agreements as a basis for individual orders. The term of such framework agreements typically varies from 24 to 36 months and in most cases the framework agreements do not contain any firm purchase commitments. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry and Business—We may be unable to _maintain positive working relationships with healthcare professionals, such as surgeons, healthcare providers and medical school professionals.”_ 159 ----- _Instrument sets_ We design internally the instrument sets, which include the tools necessary to implant prostheses and outsource their production. Different instrument sets are developed and supplied with our various products and product lines. We believe that the supply of our instrument sets to surgeons and hospitals has a positive impact on our sales as instrument sets are the necessary tools for surgeons to implant our products. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, we spent €14.9 million, €17.4 million and €15.1 million, respectively, on the purchase of new instrument components and instrument sets. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, our investment in instruments sets increased in 2020 and 2021 in anticipation of the market rebounding and the number of surgeries increasing as the effects of the pandemic begin to subside. In line with industry practice, we supply surgeons with instrument sets along with our implants on a consignment basis, so they can have prostheses readily available for surgery. Instrument sets provided to hospitals and surgeons generally depreciate over the course of five years, although in some cases can last longer before they need to be replaced. Given the significant investment involved, we have a strict process to approve and reallocate instruments sets within and across countries with the objective of maximizing return. One of the key parameters we use in this process is the Turns-Per-Set (“TPS”) ratio, defined as the number of implants performed with an instrument set over a period of one year, which we constantly track with the support of digital applications. The TPS ratio combined with the local profitability allows us to prioritize investments. We believe that instrument sets are of paramount importance for our sales process. Given the specific nature of our implants, instrument sets can be used only for specific products. We work closely with surgeons and other medical professionals by providing instrument sets and the necessary training to use our implants. We also conduct trainings and provide instrument sets to medical schools, where we teach medical students how to use our instruments and implants, fostering relationships with new surgeons as well as strengthening relationships with medical school professionals. Once the surgeon is trained to use a certain instrument set, switching suppliers of orthopedic products could be labor-intensive and costly for many of our customers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Our top ten clients represented 10%, 11% and 9% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively and our public institutions customers, including hospitals, represented for the year ended as of December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 represented, respectively, 34%, 31% and 35% of our revenues. _Direct Sales_ Our direct sales network is composed of sales representatives, non-stocking distributors, agents and sub-agents who call directly on public hospitals and private clinics. Their primary contact point is the orthopedic surgeon who has a strong role in the purchasing decision. However, there are other stakeholders in this process who are gaining more and more importance over time. As an example, Group Purchasing Organizations and Tenders managed mostly by hospital administrators are often the only way to enter a specific center. In certain countries insurance companies also play an important role as they reimburse only select implants. We have a balanced mix of customers, which we have developed steadily over the years, ranging from public hospitals to private hospitals, ASCs and independent clinicians. The overall split between public and private customers varies across regions. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2021 the public sector represented approximately 55% and the private sector represented 45% in Italy, while during the same period, in countries such as the U.S., our private customer base was significantly larger than our public customer base. Although some of our customers (such as hospitals) do not enter into long-term commitment contracts with us, we have been able to maintain and grow our customer base as a result of their increased familiarity with our implants and the high quality and reliability of our products. We have a high rate of customer retention, with 92.0% of our top 50 customers and 80.0% of our top ten extremities customers in 2019 remaining our customers in 2021. We frequently organize international and local training events (including the option of distance learning) and medical training for surgeons in collaboration with local product managers and key opinion leaders. We believe these events represent an opportunity for the participants to learn how to use our products and instrument sets and for us to have a direct dialogue with the surgeons, understand their needs and discuss their proposals. 160 ----- _Distributors_ We have a global network of distributors across 26 countries through which we sell inventory, implants and instrument sets. The distributor markets allow rapid growth in share without long lead time for investment in sales infrastructure. We usually use national distributors in countries where we do not have our own entity, supporting with local key contacts and regulatory knowledge. _OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer)_ We supply our products to other implant manufacturers. This arrangement is sometimes driven by regulatory factors, for example, where an OEM lacks regulatory approval for its own products in certain countries.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Our medical education offering has expanded significantly on the digital front, using new technologies to connect labs and operating rooms around the world for training and remote proctoring with state of the art visualization. Within our digital process, we also offer virtual factory tours in our headquarters in Villanova di San Daniele, Italy. These tours are organized live and tailored for each surgeon to allow them to experience how we approach manufacturing and development. In person visits to the factory were put on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic but we have now re-opened our doors to surgeon visitors. We frequently organize international and local training events (including the option of distance learning) and medical training for surgeons in collaboration with local product managers and key opinion leaders. In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we organized 40 courses for surgeons alone. We further organized over 70 courses in 2021 and we intend to continue increasing the number of courses we offer and surgeons trained going forward. We manage all of our surgeon engagements through an online platform for maximum transparency and tracking from a compliance perspective. We have operations throughout the world and manage our operations through five main geographic areas: Europe (excluding Italy), Italy, APAC, the United States and Other (including Turkey, Russia, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Canada). In order to optimize capital allocation and instrument efficiency we prioritize our attractive markets. One of the key parameters we use to reallocate instruments within or outside the country is the TPS ratio, defined as the number of implants performed with an instrument set over a period of one year, which we constantly track with the support of digital applications. Our broad geographic platform results in a high level of diversification, including in terms of type of third party payors with a prevalence of government reimbursement in Europe and private insurances in the United States.

From our headquarters in Italy, we deliver directly to certain direct customers and distributors, but we also rely on our subsidiaries to distribute our products. Through our global sales network, we are able to serve customers in 51 countries and monitor client satisfaction. We utilize a global approach to sales force training (including digital learning option), corporate marketing, brand positioning and medical education to provide consistent, high quality service. Our sales and marketing strategies are geared to adapt to local requirements of each region and, therefore, in response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world, our organizational structures differ by country. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 we derived 86%, 84% and 85% of our revenue through our direct network of sales representatives and sales agents, with our indirect sales, distributor network and OEM sales accounting for the remainder of our revenues for the period (with OEMs accounting 5% of our revenue as of December 31, 2021, compared to 7% of our revenues as of December 31, 2020 and 5% as of December 31, 2019). Despite the growing influence of hospital administrations and their efforts to contain costs, surgeons in the orthopedics market still play a significant part in the decision-making process. While the safety of the implant represents one of the most important factors surgeons take into account, surgeons also value the reliability and ease of use of the products as well as the training and medical education. Our prepared and trained sales personnel and easy to use instrument sets are key for our positioning. In particular, during more complex surgeries, the technical know-how and expertise of sales personnel is highly regarded as they can provide valuable advice. As a result, we invest a significant amount of time in training sales representatives in how to use specific products and how to provide surgeons with valuable education on our product features and uses. Our sales force representatives have strong technical skills and medical education to provide technical support to surgeons. In 2020, we focused on the further digitization of our sales process in order to maintain our relationships with key opinion leaders and other strategic customers throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. _Sales and Non-Sales Training_ Training represents a strategic lever for the growth of our people and gives us a competitive advantage. The three objectives which guide our training plan development for all our stakeholders are to inspire our people with the reasons why we are in the orthopedic business, provide information and guidelines and provide a personalized and continuous learning process to accelerate the adequate preparation to provide the market to a high level of service. In-person courses, online training through Lima Genius, our eLearning platform, product training for sales representatives with different sessions, practical exercises and surgery simulations, are some examples of what we offer, on both a global and local level. 162 ----- Internal courses are organized for the engineers and for the marketing team and include operating room experiences to enable them to witness our products in action and see the ultimate purpose of their work: to improve patient’s lives.

We carry a broad product portfolio of orthopedic implants, focusing on product lines that offer relatively higher value in terms of expected market growth. We specifically focus on what we identify as high value-add products, namely products for the extremities segment (shoulder and elbow), hip and knee “revision” implants (which replace existing implants, as opposed to “primary,” _i.e. first-time implants), ProMade custom solutions manufactured for revision and other complex primary surgeries and Trabecular Titanium 3D printed devices. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 55.4%, 54.4% and 54.0% of our revenue were derived from what we refer to as “high value-add” products, namely: - products for the high-growth extremities segment, which, for the year ended December 31, 2021 represented 35.3% of our revenue (excluding TT 3D printed products and custom implants, which are accounted for under a different product line), compared to 34.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 34.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019; the shoulder market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.0% to 5.5% from 2019 to 2025, according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company; - hip and knee revision implants, which, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we estimate represented 6.8% of our revenue (excluding TT 3D printed products and custom implants), compared to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019; based on our experience in the market, this type of product is generally priced 30% higher than primary implants due to its inherent complexity; - custom implants, which represented 1.7% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019; this market, in which we hold a leading position thanks to our ProMade products, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8% to 12% 2019 and 2025, according to industry and market data analyzed by a global management consulting company; and - our TT 3D printed differentiated technology, which generates higher profit margins compared to our standard products and represented 11.6% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We plan to continue growing our presence in these segments. Our differentiated 3D printed TT implants position us to benefit from the shift to outpatient clinics and ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”) (mainly present in the United States) for less complex, routine orthopedic procedures, a trend that has been further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe we are well prepared for the shift toward ASCs and we are in the process of developing pilot offerings with ASC-based surgeons and managers (for example, the streamlining of trays (part of our instrument sets) and co-marketing initiatives). We operate in the large and attractive global orthopedic implants market, underpinned by strong fundamentals, valued at approximately $45.5 billion in 2019 and project to grow even further. According to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company, the shoulder, knee and hip implants market in our key markets, the U.S., Italy, Germany, the UK, Australia, Japan and France totaled approximately $13.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.0% to 1.5% from 2019 to 2025. 163 ----- ###### Shoulder, Knee and Hip Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2007-2025 ($Bn) _Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._ Our market is expected to continue benefitting from favorable structural tailwinds, including the following: - **Demographic factors: Demographic factors such as aging of the global population, increased levels of chronic diseases, rising levels of obesity worldwide (affecting younger and younger populations) and active lifestyles, particularly in advancing years, as well as sports-related and other injuries, lead to greater wear on joints and higher rates of degenerative diseases, which tends to support greater spending in the orthopedics market. - **COVID-19 backlog: Due to the characteristics of a “product of need” and the importance of orthopedic devices in treating patients suffering from injuries to bones and joints or supporting soft tissue injuries, the global orthopedic market historically has proven to be resilient, including during the recent global financial crisis and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significantly, there is pent-up demand in the global orthopedics market as a result of the postponement of a large number of non-emergency and elective procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe will contribute to increased spending in the orthopedics market over the medium-term until the demand for non-urgent procedures has been absorbed. - **Growth in high-value segments: The extremities market (particularly for shoulder implants, which is one of our core product lines), which generally benefits from higher profitability as compared to other segments, is growing faster than the overall global orthopedic implants market, with joint prostheses being the fastest growing segment at a CAGR of approximately 5.0% to 5.5% between 2019 and 2025 (according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company) and some key geographical areas growing even faster. For instance, the orthopedic implant market for joints in Australia, one of our strongest geographies in APAC, was forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 3.0% to 3.5% between 2019 and 2025 (according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.8,Our Competitive Strengths,1241.8.2,Innovative orthopedics portfolio with superior shoulder platform and revision portfolio supporting a well- defined positioning in high-value segments with significant barriers to entry,"We offer a broad range of innovative orthopedic devices across four product lines—extremities, knee, hip and fixation and other devices. This range includes a comprehensive suite of implants geared towards stable and mature orthopedic segments such as primary hip and knee implants, as well as niche higher-growth, higher-margin segments such as our extremities product line, revision implants and custom-made products for patients with orthopedic needs requiring highly complex surgeries. Further, our portfolio includes specialized products, featuring innovative prosthetic implants for joint reconstruction using state-of-the-art technologies, including 3D printing. Our product range includes implants for total joint replacements, whether for the first time (primary implants) or to replace an existing implant (revisions). 164 ----- Given our product diversification, we benefit from our presence in higher-margin, higher-complexity and less-commoditized orthopedic segments as well as the regular revenue stream from higher-volume, less complex implants segments. Our differentiated positioning as a provider of customized solutions and implants for more complex procedures has allowed us to outperform market growth. Our custom-made implants, tailored to the specifications of individual patients facing highly complex orthopedic interventions, often replace bone defects in revision or re-revision surgeries, and increase our recognition with both patients and surgeons by providing a solution to highly complex procedures. We are particularly strong in the high-growth and high-margin extremities market, which represented 40.2% and 39.7% of our revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively, (compared to 37.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019), and, within our extremities product line, have developed the SMR, a leading line of modular shoulder implants with 20 years of clinical follow-up history and over 160,000 implants sold worldwide since it was launched in 2002. Our complete SMR shoulder platform is a differentiator in the market as it provides a complete system for shoulder replacement across a full range of cases and continuum of care. It is a reliable and easy-to-use system for surgeons, and was the first to obtain a 10A Orthopedic Data Evaluation Panel (“ODEP”) rating for SMR Reverse in 2017. We believe that the future growth of our shoulder product sub-segment will be characterized by innovation and portfolio completion through ongoing product development. In particular, we are proud of our in-house development of TT, our proprietary, patented materials technology that is 3D printed using titanium alloys and that has an ideal porosity, promoting bone growth and integration. We utilize our TT technology in both off-the-shelf as well as custom-made products, allowing us to address a range of orthopedic needs including complex cases that require a bespoke solution. Our TT technology benefits from over 14 years of clinical data and more than 182,000 implants sold worldwide to date. Using these and other innovative technologies, we have recently successfully launched new products such as (i) the SMR Hybrid Glenoid, (ii) the SMR Lateralized Connectors, (iii) the SMR Short Stem and (iv) the SMR TT Augmented 360 Glenoid. In addition, we have several products in development, including the Prima Short Stem (which is in the Controlled Release phase), the Prima TT glenoid and our Smart SPACE digital solutions for shoulder. Within these digital solutions, we plan to launch the Lima Patient Specific Instruments (the “LPSI”) during the course of 2023, as an improved solution that allows surgeons to autosegment CT scans, plan cases and design 3D positioners. We obtained approval from the FDA for our IDE to initiate the SMR Stemless Reverse clinical trial in the U.S. and in April 2021, the first surgery was performed within the U.S. clinical trial. Stemless Anatomic and Reverse are already approved in various countries outside of U.S. with positive clinical results. We have also developed one of the first 3D printed modular elbow systems, leveraging our technical know-how and existing relationships with surgeons, and we are currently developing a complete modular ankle system to complete a full-suite extremities platform. Beyond our expertise in the extremities product line, we benefit from a strong foundation in the hip and knee segments, supported by a track record of clinical outcomes. As of the date of this offering memorandum, our comprehensive portfolio of knee products includes (i) Physica ZUK, a single-compartment knee prosthetic implant, which has shown excellent clinical results and lowest revision rates at 10 years (according to an analysis by HQIP), and (ii) the Physica primary system for whole knee joint replacement. Our portfolio of hip products includes (i) TT 3D printed acetabular cups which provide increased primary cup stability due to higher friction co-efficient and secondary fixation through bone ingrowth, and (ii) cemented and cementless primary and revision femoral stems. Recent launches in the knee segment include (i) the 3D printed Anatomic Metaphyseal Fixation (“AMF”) TT Cones for complex primary and revision knee surgery, (ii) the new Physica VitE and LMC liners, as well as (iii) the Physica Cementless Knee. We carry a large portfolio of hip stems covering various surgical use cases, from primary to revision. Future launches are expected to include the High Posterior Stabilized (“HPS”) Physica knee and the Physica Revision System (CCK and Hinge). The segments in which we operate present high barriers to potential new entrants, which include the following: - **Regulatory environment: The regulatory environment for orthopedic implants requires significant investments and expertise to adhere to strict global standards, with substantial time, resources and data needed to secure approvals and acceptance of quality standards by regulatory bodies and clinicians. In particular, the EU Medical Devices Regulation, which became applicable on May 26, 2021 in the EU, imposes a stricter certification process with heightened clinical data requirements and equivalence to predicate devices. Compliance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation will present a barrier to those companies that do not already have the extensive clinical data required. 165 ----- - **Required investment in innovation and technology: Advanced technological product enhancements and an increased focus on digital and computer-assisted procedures require significant investment in innovation and systems to facilitate shifting surgical needs. - **Intellectual property: Developing or acquiring patents is needed to differentiate the product offering in the market from commoditized implants and solutions, as well as to keep a competitive edge and gain first-mover advantage (increasingly important for software and digital solutions). Specifically, as of September 30, 2022 we have a total of 312 granted and pending patents and we have, in the past, successfully defended our intellectual property. - **Customer and provider relationships: Critical need to develop and maintain long-term relationships and partnerships with surgeons, hospitals, third-party payors and regulatory agencies. - **Provider consolidation trends: Hospital and provider group consolidation across markets has resulted in increased pressure on supply chains and product purchasing decisions, further increasing orthopedic companies’ competition for available market share. - **Shift to outpatient care setting: Tailored strategies required to best address an ongoing shift in procedures performed in an outpatient setting (such as streamlined trays), given the increased use of ambulatory surgery centers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.8,Our Competitive Strengths,1241.8.3,"Strong R&D platform, track record of innovation and new product launches based on engineering heritage and surgeon collaboration","We have a world-class in-house R&D team consisting of approximately 140 professionals (as of December 31, 2021) with extensive experience in biomedical engineering and other key areas of expertise. These professionals are located at our Research & Innovation Center (“R&I Center”) and Advanced Laboratory for Testing and Analysis (“ATLAs”) at our headquarters in Villanova di San Daniele, Italy, which is focused on hardware, as well as at our Digital Center of Excellence in Knoxville, Tennessee, which is focused on digital applications. We have invested an aggregate of €49.6 million in R&D (capitalized and expensed) in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The quality of our R&D team is evidenced by our recent innovative product launches such as the SMR TT Hybrid Glenoid, the SMR lateralized connectors, the SMR short stem and the SMR TT Augmented 360 Glenoid for the extremities segment and the AMF TT cones, the new Physica Vit E and LMC liners and the Physica Cementless Knee (comprising a porous femoral component and TT Tibial plate printed in 3D) for the knee segment. We also have a robust new product development pipeline which we believe will result in new product launches generating accelerated growth. This includes (i) the Prima Short Stem, the convertible short stem implant following the latest surgical trends for the U.S. market, which is currently in the Controlled Release phase, (ii) the Prima Glenoid component which incorporates our TT technology, (iii) the “Shoulder in a Box” offering for the extremities segment, (iv) the Physica High Posterior Stabilized Liner, (vi) the full CCK and Hinge revision system for the knee segment; and (vi) the new Revision Stem and TT Cranial Augments for the hip segment. We were among the first to use 3D-printing in orthopedics, with our first 3D-printed clinical product implanted in 2007, and we have continued to increase and refine our expertise in the field to produce innovative products. In particular, we leveraged our knowledge in 3D printing to create Trabecular Titanium, a proprietary, advanced multiplanar cellular structure made entirely of commercial-grade titanium alloys which we use across product lines to manufacture certain implants. Used in our implants, TT offers a scaffold for cell colonization and bone tissue vascularization. Its optimal porosity and pore size promotes improved transportation of oxygen, nutrients, ions and other bone-inducing factors, which favor the formation of new bone tissue around the prosthesis, an outcome supported by pre-clinical testing. TT is one of our most advanced technologies, with no limitation on shape in the design phase, and we intend to continue to leverage it to further diversify our product portfolio and create cutting-edge new implants, such as the SMR TT Augmented 360 Glenoid in our shoulder sub-segment. Additionally, our ProMade brand, through which we provide custom product solutions, combines our experience in design, 3D printing and titanium processing, enabling us to develop patient-specific implants and surgical guides for complex cases. We have also developed a web-based platform that provides and enhances interaction and collaboration between surgeons and our engineers to design and produce custom-made solutions for the most complex orthopedics cases. 166 ----- Our R&D team also maintains a long and consistent track-record of obtaining government-backed research grants of approximately €1 million per annum during the last 20 years. We continued to invest in innovation during the COVID-19 pandemic and, in 2021, we obtained 24 patent approvals and applied for 15 new patents. As of September 30, 2022, we had 157 granted patents and had 155 patent applications pending. We received regulatory authorizations and certifications for 50 products in 2021, which we believe reflects our strong collaboration with regulators and ability to effectively manage the approval process of innovative products. To complement our in-house R&D team, we also maintain and continue to establish relationships with research institutions, leading surgeons, and hospitals globally, such as the HSS in New York City. In January 2019, we and the HSS (one of the leading orthopedic hospitals in the U.S., ranked by U.S. News as the leader in U.S. for orthopedics for 12 consecutive years and top-ranked in orthopedics and rheumatology for 30 consecutive years) announced the creation of what we believe is the first design and 3D printing facility for custom complex implants in a hospital setting, at the point of care. The ProMade PoC Center, which was inaugurated and became operational in March 2021, is operated by us on the HSS main campus in New York City and leverages the combination of our advanced technology and experience, and HSS’ expertise in clinical care and biomechanical engineering, as well as proximity to patients. The partnership increases the availability and speed of personalized orthopedic care for patients with complex reconstruction cases in the U.S., reducing the time required during the design and production phase. Beyond the U.S., we work with major European orthopedic centers and universities such as University College London and Wrightington Hospital in the UK and IRCCS Instituto Ortopedico Galeazzi in Italy. We have also invested in clinical studies for long-term product life cycle sustainability and market access to certain key geographies, such as Australia and the UK. We believe we are well-prepared for transitioning our legacy portfolio products towards compliance with Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (the “EU Medical Devices Regulation”) which became applicable on May 26, 2021 but includes a number of transitional provisions for certain medical devices to comply with said regulation. Our structured Regulatory and Clinical Research Departments have anticipated the need for quality control systems, regulated procedures and clinical data collection that are now required for the EU Medical Devices Regulation. We remain at the forefront of technical development through our R&D team and strategic partnerships with leading orthopedic innovators, which continue to drive our product pipeline. We are also driving the digital transformation in orthopedics with our Smart SPACE digital solutions. We received FDA clearances for the Smart SPACE shoulder planner and glenoid 3D positioner in November 2019, and the first case was performed in February 2020 followed by a Controlled Release. Our humeral 3D positioner received FDA clearance in December 2020 and our Cubit Guidance product received FDA clearance for assistance in the intraoperative positioning of shoulder implants used in certain shoulder arthroplasty procedures in February 2021 (with the first case performed in March 2021). In 2023 we will launch the LPSI, an improved solution that allows surgeons to autosegment CT scans, plan cases and design 3D positioners. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing shift toward surgical navigation and robotics solutions. New technologies launched in digitally-assisted surgery over recent years have shown high adoption rates and the market for 3D planning and guidance solutions is projected to grow at approximately 8% to 12% CAGR between 2019 and 2025, according to market and industry data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.8,Our Competitive Strengths,1241.8.4,"Highly resilient financial profile with strong growth track record, supported by significant COVID-19 backlog","We demonstrated resilience and navigated through the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related supply chain disruptions. Given the essential nature of our business, we remained operational during the COVID-19 pandemic, and were able to continue launching new products. For example, we launched the SMR Short Stem, the Physica LMC liners and the Physica VitE liners, and started the Controlled Release of the AMF TT Cones, the TT Augmented 360 and the cementless knee (comprising a porous femur component and a TT Tibial plate), demonstrating our strong resilience and our ability to successfully adapt to the asymmetric trends recorded in the markets in which we operate by leveraging the significant breadth of our product portfolio. We demonstrated earnings resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, with our revenues declining by 12.9% between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, which was less than the approximately 15% to 20% decline in our (weighted) key markets of the U.S., Italy, Germany, UK, Australia, Japan, France (according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company). The following graphic sets forth details of our revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the periods presented. 167 ----- Since the stabilization of the pandemic, we have experienced a strong recovery supported by a backlog of demand, resuming our pre-COVID-19 sales momentum. One of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic was the postponement of a large number of non-emergency and elective procedures, as, among other factors, (i) hospital capacity and healthcare resources were significantly re-routed to deal with patients suffering from COVID-19, (ii) many hospitals and healthcare providers placed restrictions on the number and type of non-emergency and elective procedures performed at their facilities, and (iii) many candidates for such procedures preferred to minimize their exposure to clinical settings for fear of contracting COVID-19. For example, as of February 2022, the British National Health Service estimated that 6.0 million people were on the waiting list for planned service delivery, up from 4.4 million prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-urgent medical procedures in the United States were also significantly disrupted, with providers in some parts of the country, such as Texas and Florida, banning elective surgeries in 2020. We believe there is significant pent-up demand for our products as a result of the lockdowns that restricted elective procedures across our markets. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we estimate such backlog to amount to over €60.0 million of sales for our business over the medium-term. As the capacity of healthcare facilities and providers returns to, or exceeds, pre-COVID-19 levels, we believe this backlog will be absorbed over the next few years, resulting in a de-risking of a significant portion of our future revenue growth. During the pandemic, we continued to invest in the growth of our business and purchased inventory and instrument sets, and spent on the development of new products (thereby increasing our working capital) in 2020, which we believe will yield customer conversions and further growth in the business. We believe we are already seeing the benefits of our preparedness to take advantage of this backlog, with revenue increasing by 16.2% to €180.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from €155.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant disruptions to ordinary course business practices across commercial industries, including the medical device industry. Beyond decreased sales as a result of delayed medical procedures, resulting in higher inventories across the industry, payment and delivery terms were extended for market participants, their customers and their suppliers, resulting in working capital increases as inventories remained on hand and as payables and receivables remained outstanding for relatively longer periods of time. In connection with the post-pandemic rebound in commercial activity across our industry, we are experiencing an encouraging normalization in our days sales outstanding (“DSO”) and days inventory outstanding (“DIO”), with the foregoing trending back towards their pre-pandemic 2019 levels, aided by increased sales in geographies with better payment terms, such as the United States. We also expect to similarly move towards normalizing our days 168 ----- payables outstanding (“DPO”) to pre-COVID-19 levels over the medium term. We expect these existing and expected normalization trends to continue for the foreseeable future, contributing to further improvements to our cash generation.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In particular, our high margins related to our strategic positioning across regular and high value-add orthopedics segments have also allowed us to maintain consistently high Gross Margins of 74.8%, 74.3% and 74.0% on revenues of €222.8 million, €194.0 million and €212.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and a Gross Margin of 73.6% on revenue of €237.9 million as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. Importantly, we were able to progressively increase our Adjusted EBITDA Margin from 25.8% to 26.6% between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 by implementing a number of concurrent cost savings and restructuring initiatives, and further increased our Adjusted EBITDA Margin to 29.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021, which we believe positions us among the most profitable players in our industry. We are committed to further improving our profitability based on operational efficiencies and various strategic initiatives, such as: - optimizing efficiency by aiming to maintain high “turns-per-set” (defined as the number of implants performed with an instrument set over a period of one year, which we constantly track with the support of digital applications) in countries with lower average sales prices (“ASPs”) while accepting lower turns-perset in countries with higher ASPs, such as the high-margin U.S. market; - savings initiatives, such as price negotiation initiatives and the implementation of channel cost savings that we accrued by lowering travel and medical conference costs during the COVID-19 pandemic; - continued development of state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies to boost flexibility, quality and efficiency through manufacturing efficiency initiatives covering finishing, machining, coating, additive manufacturing, packaging and clean rooms, including the following measures which resulted from a fiveyear manufacturing optimization program: (i) the digitalization of systems via automated data capture, (ii) RFID usage on our raw materials to maintain visibility on our value chain, (iii) the implementation of automated robotic labeling and packaging processes; and - continued focus on strategic sourcing to optimize our already well-balanced and dependable supplier base, through initiatives such as concentrating suppliers in western Europe while reducing them in number (minimizing lead times and mitigating disruption risks), implementing long-term agreements and multisourcing programs (for example, double-sourcing of our knee femoral casting, hip stem and knee tibial plate forging, knee poly liner and primary packaging). As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not experienced supply chain disruptions in 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.8,Our Competitive Strengths,1241.8.6,Well-invested platform of scale with diversified presence across geographies,"We have a state-of-the-art manufacturing network that we believe provides high-quality, precise and consistent production. With the goal of minimizing human error and enhancing efficiencies, we leverage the expertise of our long-standing employees with in-depth knowledge of manufacturing best practices to program and continue to perfect our increasingly automated process, thereby integrating human experience with advanced engineering processes. These factors, combined with our longstanding relationships with dependable suppliers, allow for a highly efficient supply chain that is able to adapt quickly to changes in market demand. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not experienced supply chain disruptions in 2022. We believe we are among the largest 3D printing manufacturers in orthopedics. We have two state-of-the-art, highly efficient production facilities in Italy. Our two production facilities have reached a high level of automation, enabling us to respond more rapidly and flexibly to the requirements of our clients. Both facilities are highly efficient with Overall Equipment Efficiency (“OEE”) and Overall Labor Efficiency (“OLE”) above 80% in 2021. In June 2018, we completed the expansion of our facility in Villanova di San Daniele, thus doubling our manufacturing capacity. More recently in 2020, we invested €3.5 million for a new clean room in our facility in Villanova di San Daniele, which was completed in first quarter of 2021. We also benefit from our 169 ----- in-house state-of-the-art ATLAs testing lab in Villanova di San Daniele where we conduct in-house mechanical and chemical testing supported by an industry 4.0 Web App to manage the process. Our Capital Expenditures amounted to €122.5 million between 2019 and 2021, of which (i) €47.4 million was linked to investments in instrument sets (which we expect to drive incremental revenue), (ii) €36.0 million was used on property, plant and equipment, primarily to expand production capacity via new production and manufacturing machinery, including new 3D printing facilities and a grey room plant, (iii) €19.2 million was linked to the TechMah acquisition between 2019 and 2021 and (iv) €19.9 million was related to expenditures on other intangibles, comprising start-up and expansion costs, R&D, development and costs related to patents and intellectual property rights not otherwise attributable to TechMah’s integrated end-to-end digital surgery platform (“Smart SPACE”). For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our investments were aimed at implementing further growth and classified as Growth Capital Expenditures (i.e., discretionary expenditures) while the remaining 20% consisted of maintenance investments and classified as Maintenance Capital Expenditures, in line with approximately 80% and 20% for the year ended December 31, 2020. In the medium term, we expect to benefit from our previous investments in our platform and to gradually reduce our Growth Capital Expenditure as a result of the long life of the instruments sets deployed and the expected increase in turn per sets. As such, we expect our yearly Maintenance Capital Expenditures over the medium-term to amount to approximately €5-8 million, in line with historical levels, and our yearly Growth Capital Expenditures to remain in the range of 5-10% of sales (with Growth Capital Expenditures trending towards the lower end of this range assuming the completion of our discretionary expansion of production capacity at our Villanova di San Daniele site in 2024, including a distribution center and additional manufacturing plant capacity). These strong manufacturing capabilities benefit from an extensive global network that gives us proximity to attractive local markets and a diversified footprint with sales across more than 50 countries. Our global operations cover both mature markets and growing economies with 38.7% of our revenue generated in Europe (excluding Italy), 19.6% in Italy, 17.1% in the United States, 16.0% in APAC and 8.6% in the Rest of the World for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. We operate through subsidiaries in 25 countries and serve 26 countries through distributors, and have expanded into seven new markets since 2012 (Belgium, Brazil, South Korea, Poland, U.S., China and Canada). As of December 31, 2021, we had 192 direct sales representatives globally. We have a strong footprint in Europe, where we serve our clients in most cases directly through local managers and approximately 120 sales representatives in addition to more than 80 agents. We also have an established presence in the U.S., the largest global orthopedics market and a core focus for our growth initiatives. Our robust set-up in the U.S. includes a sales force of approximately 150 sales representatives as of December 31, 2021, demonstrating our strong existing local presence that establishes a foundation on which to further expand and gain market share. We have demonstrated the ability to set up geographic coverage in the U.S. and will build upon our strong local footprint that has already captured top 10 positions in certain segments such as shoulder. Moreover, our partnership with the HSS to advance ProMade custom solutions and the innovation center (acquired as part of the TechMah transactions) for digital applications development in Tennessee firmly establish our local presence and will allow us to convert additional customers in the region. We also have a solid presence in fast-growing APAC markets (including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea), with more than 60 sales representatives. We are also expanding into China where we established a subsidiary in 2021. To complement our growth, we have invested and plan to continue to strategically invest in new products and in key geographies when attractive opportunities arise. We believe that we have significant expertise in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions, while remaining focused on our financial performance. It is not our strategy to seek acquisitions purely to increase market share. Rather, we are focused on products and technologies that we can manufacture and optimize, and on opportunities to obtain a foothold in important new markets. We are also open to acquisitions in geographies where we have an increasing market presence to boost growth and expand our footprint within that particular geography.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Our management team has a strong track record of delivering on growth initiatives, including new product development and customer acquisition, as well as maximizing the value of our product portfolio and identifying new development opportunities. Our management team, with its strong and differentiated expertise and broad international background, is well positioned to implement our international strategy. As we continue to expand our geographic footprint and global operations, we may take advantage of opportunities to further enhance and supplement our management talent, both from inside our organization as well as with external candidates. We have made key investments into our human capital, specifically aiming to strengthen our local management, sales force, medical education and R&D teams to ensure continued success in accessing our markets as well as product innovation. We have made five key management hires since 2019 and added over 300 customers in 2021 notwithstanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our indirect shareholders, EQT and Loreda, an investment vehicle owned by Hansjörg Wyss (former owner of Synthes, now DePuy Synthes, an orthopedics manufacturer which was acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2012), who have supported us through the years, including via a capital injection of €20.0 million in June 2020, providing precautionary support and financial flexibility during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Restoring movement can fundamentally change a person’s life. That is why, in everything we do, we are passionately driven by our desire to restore the “emotion of motion.” With that in mind, we and our management believe that ESG matters should be at the core of our corporate strategy, specifically by: (i) obtaining top environmental certifications and implementing climate-friendly policies; (ii) utilizing the highest standards of reporting and 171 ----- transparency, in line with or even exceeding those of publicly-listed companies; and (iii) maintaining the utmost responsibility and duty toward our employees’ well-being and society as a whole. For example, we achieved an ISO 14000 certification for our Villanova plant in 2017 and for our Segesta plant in Sicily in 2018, and we comply with the requirements stated by the AUA Permit (Unique Environmental Permit according to Italian Law D.P.R 59/2013). Given the under-representation of women in our industry, we are committed to increasing the number of females in our workforce. In 2021, 35.1% of our employees were women. During the COVID-19 crisis, we implemented a variety of initiatives, including: (i) support to the Red Cross through a donation that was used for the purchase of a blood drive vehicle; (ii) other donations for the purchase of digital devices intended for COVID-19 patients to communicate with their families; and (iii) the development and donation of transparent face shields to different hospitals (Belluno, Udine, Rimini, San Marino, Tolmezzo, Padova, Piove di Sacco, San Camillo di Cremona, Clinica SoletSalus Rimini) as well as to “Mondo Charge”—a non-profit organization dedicated to CHARGE syndrome—which allowed people with this rare syndrome to be protected while still being able to communicate. Finally, our employees individually contributed with donations to the Red Cross across different countries. We have established, built and strengthened our ESG commitment by refining our corporate strategy, setting targets and tracking key performance indicators. We use the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) to inspire sustainable behavior and have put in place ESG key performance indicators which specifically track and assess performance in areas which contribute to the SDGs.

We believe that as a result of our innovative and high-quality products as well as our ability to provide superior customer service, we have built strong relationships with surgeons and hospitals. Our product range includes implants for total joint replacements, whether for the first time (primary implants) or to replace an existing implant (“revisions”). As of the date of this offering memorandum, we operate through four main product lines: (i) hip, (ii) extremities, (iii) knees, and (iv) fixation and other devices. Additionally, through our ProMade brand, we provide custom-made solutions for patients with complex orthopedic needs across most of our product lines. Trabecular Titanium (“TT”) is one of our core technologies, which was developed on the basis of our 3D printing capabilities and which we use across product lines to manufacture certain implants. It offers the scaffold for cell colonization and bone tissue vascularization. An optimal porosity and pore size promote enhanced vascularization and mineralization, favoring new bone formation. Stem cells grown on TT scaffolds have shown to adhere, proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts, even in the absence of osteogenic factors. Histomorphometric analysis in a sheep model comparing TT with traditional coatings showed that TT favors direct osteogenesis with high osseointegration.

Our extremities segment accounted for 37.8%, 38.7% and 39.7% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We believe our distinctive SMR system is a leading product globally, with more than 15 years of clinical history. Our SMR system represents one of the first truly modular shoulder systems available in the market, allowing for an easier revision as the patient’s pathology naturally progresses, from the surgeon’s point of view, and less invasive surgery for the patient. The SMR design covers different pathologies encountered across a range of procedures, including resurfacing (where only the head of the humerus is replaced), total anatomic shoulder, reverse shoulder (where the shoulder geometry is reversed to improve the range of movement) or revisions. We believe our focus on the shoulder and providing numerous options for surgeons to choose the optimal implant for their patient position us and the SMR System among market leaders, in particular for the U.S., and in a higher profitability segment, also as a result of the use of our TT technology.

We intend to further strengthen and expand our existing international operations to attractive markets, such as the U.S., Australia, Japan, Italy, UK, Spain and Germany from which we expect significant growth and where we have been investing and will continue to invest in the coming years. We expanded our U.S. team to accelerate our growth in the region. Our recently inaugurated ProMade PoC Center in partnership with HSS further improves our access to the U.S. market. We intend to further penetrate the U.S. market by expanding our existing product offering, which is currently focused on our higher-priced and higher-margin shoulder implants complemented by hip and knee implants, while leveraging our cost base in a market where orthopedic implants have historically sold at higher prices than in Europe. We also intend to capitalize on trends such as new ASCs, which are increasingly common in the United States, to address the demand for cost-efficient outpatient procedures for less complex, routine orthopedic procedures. Since ASCs purchase orthopedic implants in bulk, the volume of their demand offers a unique opportunity to expand our market share when considering high average selling prices in the U.S. market compared to Europe, even on a discounted basis. We are setting-up an advisory board composed by surgeons and other ASC stakeholders to understand specific ASC unmet needs and discuss future trends, with the aim of defining the best ASC strategy, including the development of targeted products and services, including economically structured contracts targeted to the ASCs. To solidify our technological and reputational standing in the U.S., we will continue to seek out and develop strategic partnerships with hospitals and research institutions similar to the ones we have established with HSS in New York City, the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, the Upstate Orthopedics in Syracuse, New York, the Rothman Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the Western Orthopedics in Denver, Colorado. Beyond expenditures aimed at further expansion in high-value regions, we have made significant investments in our products and facilities to support the medium-term plan of increased production capacity.

We believe that our advanced manufacturing expertise and proven track record of product innovation, combined with strategic partnerships, will create avenues for future growth. We anticipate that future growth in our revenues from ProMade will be driven by multiple factors. The market for 3D printed implants is projected to grow at approximately 8% to 12% CAGR between 2019 and 2025 (according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company). We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the space created as big players shift their focus away from custom implants due to challenges with low volumes. Our partnership with HSS also allows us to have a stronger foothold in the U.S. market. Further, we are in the process of obtaining a 510(k) clearance from the FDA for custom-made glenoids that if cleared, could accelerate the use of our custom-made solutions by U.S. customers. We also expect higher cost efficiency through automation, with a positive impact on profitability for ProMade products. Further, we aim to roll-out the HSS concept to other orthopedic centers of excellence and markets. The high quality of our processes and custom-made products is attested by the EU Quality Management System Certificate under the EU Medical Devices Regulation for Class III Custom-Made devices which we received in May 2020.

Our 3D printing process technology, which has no design boundaries, provides great benefits for the entire production value chain. Due to its highly efficient material utilization resulting in minimal waste material, the 3D printing technology is an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly manufacturing process. We manufacture our prosthetic components in TT with the EBM technology, using a high-energy focused electron beam to locally melt metallic powders layer upon layer. Due to its extremely high flexibility, EBM allows the creation of components of complex shapes involving either dense or porous parts, which results in the great versatility of TT products. Compared to laser melting, EBM takes place in a vacuum and at high temperatures to ensure excellent mechanical properties and the absence of residual stress. 184 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

ProMade was established as a brand in 2015 and as a dedicated service in 2018, drawing upon over 14 years of experience in developing 3D printed custom-made solutions for complex orthopedic reconstructions. ProMade quality is based on our design heritage and long clinical track record in building high-quality implants. We were an early adopter of 3D printing with EBM printer development and use of titanium parts (with over 182,000 3D printed implants worldwide over 14 years). Further, our proprietary manufacturing, cleaning and inspection techniques have been developed to provide the same confidence in the quality of ProMade implants as customers have come to expect over the 75 years of our history. ProMade is a design service that partners with surgeons to develop a variety of bespoke outputs, including 3D printed implants and instruments, surgical plans and anatomical models. With ProMade we take a highly collaborative approach, aiming to partner surgeons with the same design engineer to fully project manage all of their cases, allowing a high level of mutual familiarity of clinical and communication preferences and design capability. This collaborative approach is highly valued by surgeons, as not only do they obtain a patient-specific solution but one that is also tailored to the surgeon’s needs. ProMade solutions are designed with the intention (i) to give surgeons immediate confidence in the product’s performance, by providing primary implant stability _in situ, (ii) to have implants which transfer loads in biomechanically effective way and (iii) to provide clinicians with the option to execute a complete biomechanically assessed surgical plan with standard components compatible with the custom designed and produced components. This design philosophy adopted is made possible by our unique technological enablers. Trabecular Titanium demonstrates high friction with bone for primary stability, as well as clinically proven long term osseointegration. Our deep experience in design and 3D printing allows for the production of complex designs which fill and load bony defects, as opposed to relying on rim fit or peripheral bone screws as anchor points, often seen in traditional custom designs. Finally, the expanded modularity offered by compatibility with our standard line products, allows for surgeons to perform the 185 ----- entire joint replacement by combining the bespoke 3D printed component, with cost-effective standard line components, based upon a ProMade engineer’s biomechanically assessed pre-operative plan. ProMade solutions are normally required in severe cases like tumor patients, revision and especially in re-revision operations since the removal of primary and revision implants typically causes bone and tissue damage, thus demanding more sophisticated and complex implants. While developing customized implants and instrument sets requires advanced R&D capability, it also contributes to our product portfolio mix. In addition, our customized ProMade solutions enable us to establish new, and strengthen existing, relationships with surgeons, who, we believe, value the highly specialized solutions that our ProMade products provide for their complex orthopedic cases, creating pull through for our other standard products lines. The new ProMade PoC Center, which became operational in March 2021, is operated by us on the HSS main campus in New York City. We believe it is the first point of care based design and 3D printing facility for complex custom implants. The partnership is a six-year collaboration with an option for a two-year extension. The ProMade PoC Center has increased our service capability to the U.S. market by proximity and improved our regulatory access in the U.S. market. On January 4, 2019, as part of our collaboration with HSS in New York, we, Lima USA and HSS entered into a series of agreements to govern the establishment of a commercial collaboration for the development and production of customized orthopedic implants at a facility operated by Lima USA on the HSS campus, as well as HSS’ investment in Emil Newco S.à r.l.. In particular, Lima USA and the HSS will collaborate to improve musculoskeletal care and products. The key features of our ProMade service include: - _Dedicated design engineer: We endeavor to partner surgeons with the same engineer to fully project manage all their cases, allowing a highly personal approach and a service tailored to the customer’s needs. This partnership is highly valued by surgeons, who frequently consider the ProMade design engineer to be an extension of their clinical team. - _Wide spectrum offering: We can provide a wide spectrum of custom solutions, ranging from modifications of standard implants, to highly complex implants to compensate for significant bone loss/deformities in revision cases, implants designed with pre-determined resection plans for tumor/limb salvage cases and novel implants for dysplasia/osteotomy corrections. - _Patient Specific Instruments (“PSIs”) and Models:_ We offer a comprehensive set of 3D printed resection guides, PSI’s and trial implants for each surgery, to aid the surgeon in executing each step of the bespoke surgical plan. - _Bespoke surgical plans: We provide a fully comprehensive surgical plan with each solution, provided digitally for 3D image manipulation, printed in A4 for pre-procedure reading, and A2 to mount on the OR wall for quick reference during surgery. - _Fully sterile offering: The majority of our custom solutions and surgical guides/PSIs are provided sterile, providing reassurance to surgeons that they have reduced the possibility of introducing an infection into the surgical site. - _Combination with on-the-shelf products: Our standard approach is to develop custom-made solutions that can be easily combined with existing products in our portfolio. Additionally, we are able to design interfaces which allow connectivity with competitor implants where competitors provide the required permissions to access technical documentation. - _Titanium craftsmanship: We use our design experience, 3D printing and our TT technology to work with titanium and create complex design features to ensure the perfect fit. - _Surgeon specific custom instruments: We also offer the possibility to customize our standard instruments, or produce a single special request instrument for individual surgeons to use in their standard practice for their routine cases. - _Web portal: In July 2021, we launched a new web-based portal to manage end-to-end communications and data transfer between the surgeon, our engineer and other stakeholders in the 186 ----- customer solution development process, such as sales representatives and sales managers. The portal can be accessed via PC browser or mobile app and allows surgeons to engage with their ProMade engineer and review and approve documents at their convenience.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Its aim is to empower patient care stakeholders to allow them to make informed, data driven decisions in the care of patients, but to do so in an efficient and sustainable way in order to meet the needs of modern health care systems. The main products in the Smart SPACE ecosystem are the Virtual 3D planner, 3D Positioners and the assisted reality (aR) Guidance system, being made available for Primary Shoulder Arthroplasty. The 3D Virtual Planner is a digital planning software application, which utilizes proprietary machine learning algorithms that allow for powerful auto-segmentation of imaging data to very quickly generate a 3D model of the patient’s anatomy and surgical plans (and to easily select the most appropriate implant configuration from our highly modular implant portfolio) on the surgeons own PC, without the need for company engineering input. Additionally, the on-machine instrument creation tool, allows the surgeon to auto-design a 3D Positioner (PSI) and order easily with the click of one button by connecting with engineers and operations via the cloud portal. The 3D Virtual Planner will include some unique features such as the inner cortical segmentation as well as the indication of bone quality derived from a CT scan. We also plan to provide surgeons with predictive analytics driven by data acquired by means of post-operative individual patient outcomes captured through inertial sensors to support them in the decision making during the planning phase. Additionally, we will provide advance range of motion simulations, based on real patient motion analysis and kinematics biomechanical models. 187 ----- The assisted reality (aR) Guidance system, comprised of Position Tracking System (PTS), System Control Software (SCS) and assisted reality (aR) headset, aims to allow the surgeon to accurately execute the generated plan, by providing real time surgical feedback of instrument and implant positioning.

The regulatory framework in the areas of intellectual property and product safety is particularly important with regard to the Group’s business. The Group may also be subject to the Italian Golden Power Legislation, pursuant to which the Italian Government can, inter alia, prohibit or impose restrictions and conditions on (i) the acquisition of shareholdings in companies having assets and relationships in sectors qualified as strategic (e.g., defense and national security, energy, transport, communications, healthcare, _etc.), and (ii) resolutions, acts or transactions approved by companies holding assets and relationships in strategic sectors and resulting in a change in ownership, control or possession of such assets or relationships, including the enforcement of securities over the shares/assets, or in the use or purpose thereof. In particular, acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the European Union (including Italian) and acquisitions of interests by persons or entities not belonging to the European Union that entail the acquisition of at least 10% of the voting rights or share capital (provided that the value of investments is equal to at least €1 million) must be reported to the Office of the President of the Council of Ministers for the possible exercise of the veto right or the application of conditions; acquisitions that exceed the 15%, 20%, 25% and 50% of the voting rights or share capital thresholds are also subject to the reporting obligation. Starting from January 1, 2023, acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the European Union are subject to the Italian Golden Power Legislation only if related to companies holding operating in the defense and national security, communications energy, transport, healthcare, agri-food and financial sectors.

Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory framework may give rise to, _inter alia, delays in obtaining access to the market or marketing restrictions, product recalls, product seizures, interruptions in production, operating restrictions, suspension or revocation of access to the market for the products, injunctions, and administrative or criminal sanctions/fines. Such regulatory framework is subject to continuous updates that could impose more stringent requirements and, more generally, there would appear to be a worldwide trend toward an increasingly stringent regulatory framework. 194 ----- _European Union_ The European Union (“EU”) has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the “EU Medical",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,1241,OUR BUSINESS,1241.38,"Devices Directive”), which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the “EU** **Medical Devices Regulation”). Our current certificates have been granted under the EU Medical Devices Directive whose",1241.38.1,,"regime is described below. However, starting on May 26, 2021, some of the EU Medical Devices Regulation requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation when our current certificates expire and until May 26, 2025 at the latest. To date, our only medical devices placed on the market in compliance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation are class III implantable custom-made medical devices (ProMade devices). _Medical Devices Directive_ Under the EU Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. Any risks which may be associated with their use must constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and must be compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a manner suitable for its functions as specified by the manufacturer. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the involvement of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system (the notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards – which is ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems – conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to announced periodic and (additionally) unannounced surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s). 195 ----- _Medical Devices Regulation_ The regulatory landscape related to medical devices in the EU recently evolved. On April 5, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation was adopted with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. The EU Medical Devices Regulation establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensures a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Unlike the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for implementation into national law. This aims at increasing harmonization across the EU. Supplementary domestic regulation and delegated legal acts of the European Commission may further substantiate requirements applicable to the Group. Even though not legally binding, the Medical Device Coordination Group issues guidance to interpretation of the EU Medical Devices Regulation. The EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective on May 26, 2021. Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid and there must not be significant changes in the device’s design and intended purpose. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation, in particular the obligations described below. As with the previous framework, medical devices require an EU CE mark to be imported, sold or distributed within the EU. For this purpose, medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment based on a system of risk classification of the medical devices and, depending on the risk class of the device, with the involvement of a notified body. Also under the EU Medical Devices Regulation, the Group is subject to announced and unannounced surveillance audits by the notified bodies. The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to an electronic system (“Eudamed”), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The new Regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (“UDI”) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Each device – and as applicable, each package – will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device identifier (“UDI-DI”), specific to a device, and a production identifier (“UDI-PI”) to identify the unit producing the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on Eudamed, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in Eudamed will become applicable at a later date (as Eudamed is not yet fully functional). Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding vigilance reporting, clinical investigations, registration of devices and economic operators, and certificate notifications. All manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system which has been reinforced by the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”) must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through Eudamed – once functional – and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors such as the economic operators in the supply chain will also be informed. Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply. A serious incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device made available on the market, including use-error due to ergonomic features, as well as any inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer and any undesirable side-effect, which, directly or indirectly, might have led or might lead to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a temporary or permanent serious deterioration of a patient's, user's or other person's state of health or a serious public health threat. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause 196 ----- has been identified or a FSCA implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented, manufacturers may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports. The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices in connection with medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs. The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) which consists of the 27 EU Member States plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. _Brexit_ Following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the United Kingdom (the “UK”), the UK formally withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit”, and, following the expiry of the Brexit transitional period on December 31, 2020, the UK now operates under a distinct regulatory regime and certain EU laws now only apply to the UK in respect of Northern Ireland (as laid out in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland). The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, is now the UK’s standalone regulator. Although the UK and EU have now reached an agreement on its future trading relationship (implemented in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement from January 1, 2021, or the “TCA”), the agreement does not cover all regulatory areas regarding medical devices, which may be subject to future bilateral discussions going forward and could further change the relationship between the UK and the EU in this regard. EU laws which were directly applicable before the end of the transitional period or have been. transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law.” However, new legislation such as the EU Medical Devices Regulation will not be applicable. The UK government has introduced a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act which seeks to address regulatory gaps through implementing regulations and delegated powers covering the fields of human medicines, clinical studies of human medicines, and medical devices. Significantly, under the TCA there is no mutual recognition of regulatory regimes and certifications between the EU and the UK. CE marks issued by EU-based notified bodies will continue to be recognized by the UK until June 30, 2023, but from July 1, 2023, new devices placed on the Great Britain market will need to conform with the new UK Conformity Assessment (“UKCA”) marking requirements. Since January 1, 2021, medical devices placed on the market in the UK must be registered with the MHRA, following a grace period ranging from four to 12 months. Manufacturers based outside the UK will also need to appoint a UK Responsible Person (which may be an individual or a corporate entity). Only a manufacturer established in the UK or a UK Responsible Person will be able to place a device on the market in Great Britain. Under the terms of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, products placed on the market in Northern Ireland will continue to be subject to the EU regulatory regime. A public consultation by the MHRA was opened until end of November 2021 on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. The consultation proposes amendments to the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (which are based on EU legislation, primarily the Medical Devices Directive), in particular to create a new access pathways to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform in vitro diagnostic regulation, and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. The consultation indicated that the MHRA will publish guidance in relation to the changes to the regulatory framework and may rely more heavily on guidance to add flexibility to the regime. On June 26, 2022, the MHRA published its long-awaited response to 197 ----- its consultation on the UK’s post-Brexit regulatory regime for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The MHRA confirmed that the new regulatory landscape will mirror many of the provisions of the EU regulatory regime, as contained within the EU Medical Devices Regulation. However, the response also highlighted that in certain areas, medical devices regulation in Great Britain is likely to deviate from the EU framework. The UK government now needs to translate its proposals into legislation, via amendments to the UK Medical Devices Regulations (SI 2002 No 618, as amended). The regime is expected to come into force in July 2023, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements. _Italy_ The Italian regulatory framework on the Devices, which transposes the corresponding EU regulatory framework, classifies the Devices into three categories: “active implantable devices,” as defined under Legislative Decree no. 507 of December 14, 1992 (transposing the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive), “general medical devices,” as defined under Legislative Decree no. 46 of February 24, 1997 (transposing directive 93/42/EEC), and “in vitro diagnostic devices,” as defined under Legislative Decree no. 332 of September 8, 2000 (transposing the EU Medical Devices Directive). The Devices manufactured by the Group fall within the “general medical devices” category referred to in Legislative Decree no. 46 of February 24, 1997 (“Decree 46/1997”). Manufacturers that introduce Devices to the market are required to report their data to the Ministry of Health, along with a description of the devices capable of identifying them, their labels and instructions for usage, for entry into a specific database called the “Device Directory.” The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Economic Development also oversee the proper application of the national regulatory framework on the Devices through a system of inspections and controls at the manufacturers and distributors of the devices. In addition, the monitoring and oversight of the Devices introduced to the market also involve the manufacturers, operators and healthcare facilities (both public and private) that use them, since such parties are required to report to the Ministry of Health any malfunctioning or alteration of the characteristics and performances of a device, and any inadequacy in the labeling or usage instructions, that could cause, or have caused, the death or serious deterioration in the health of a patient. In particular, a manufacturer is required to report to the Ministry of Health of any accident of which it becomes aware, and of the corrective actions undertaken to reduce the risks of death or serious deterioration in the health of patients associated with the use of a Device. In the event that a causal nexus is ascertained between the accident and the medical device, the actions that may be undertaken range from a modification of the design relating to the product to a change in labeling or instructions on the use of the device, to its recall from the market. Similarly, when the Ministry of Health finds that a device, even if installed and used correctly, may compromise the health and safety of patients, users or third parties, it may order its recall from the market, to be handled by the manufacturer under its own supervision and at its own expense, or ban or limit its introduction to the market. Moreover, the Italian healthcare regulations, as recently supplemented, provide that a yearly budget to purchase medical devices is assigned to each Italian region and, in case such yearly budget is exceeded, each region shall ask for a reimbursement to the medical devices suppliers for a portion of the excess amount, and in proportion to the annual market share of each supplier in the relevant region (the “Payback Mechanism”). In particular, pursuant to Law Decree No. 115 of August 9, 2022 (as converted into Law No. 142/2022), the Italian Ministry of Health determined the amounts in excess of the regional budgets for each of the years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 in its Decree published on September 15, 2022 (the “Decree 216/2022”) and provided the guidelines that the Italian regions shall apply when asking for reimbursements under the Payback Mechanism with a Ministerial Decree published on October 6, 2022 (the “Decree 251/2022”). Pursuant to such mechanism, each region shall issue payment orders to the medical device suppliers by mid-December 2022. Should a supplier not pay the requested amounts in 30 days, Decree 216/2022 provides that such amounts are offset against any outstanding credits such suppliers towards each region and/or the entities affiliated to the regional healthcare system (the “Offset Mechanism”). With Law Decree No. 4 of January 11, 2023, the deadline for the payment of all the amounts required under the Payback Mechanism has been postponed until April 30, 2023. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business—We derive a substantial portion of our business from the award of public contracts, which requires frequent participation in competitive, highly regulated public tender offer processes, often limit our ability to negotiate pricing and other terms and make us subject to changes in public spending policies.” United States_ The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, 198 ----- adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or FDA approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified but are subject to FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. The Group’s currently marketed products include Class I exempt devices and Class II devices subject to 510(k) clearance. _510(k) Clearance_ Certain of the Group’s current products are subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed before May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo classification or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance, approval of a PMA, or issuance of a de novo classification. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification 199 ----- pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted. More recently, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised final guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as recommended testing methods in the guidance documents where feasible. _PMA Approval_ Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required approval of a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. None of the Group’s products are currently marketed pursuant to a PMA. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. _Clinical Trials_ Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (""IDE"") regulations which govern investigational 200 ----- device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective before commencing human clinical trials. If the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health, then the device sponsor is not required to submit an IDE application to the FDA before initiating human clinical trials, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements when conducting such trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (""IRB"") for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. Additionally, after a trial begins, the sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. _Post-Marketing Requirements_ After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: - establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; - QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; - labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products; - requirements related to promotional activities; - clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices; - medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 201 ----- - correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; - the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and - post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. Manufacturers are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in a variety of sanctions, including: warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; and withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted. In addition to the foregoing, the Group is required to comply with numerous U.S. federal and state laws, as well as laws of other jurisdictions, on healthcare fraud and wrongful conduct, as well as provisions to combat bribery, and on physician transparency, including: - the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits soliciting, offering, receiving or making payments (of an unlawful nature) related to goods and/or services provided by federal healthcare assistance programs (such as, for example, medicines and healthcare services for Medicare or Medicaid patients); - the presenting or causing to be presented a false claim or making, using or causing to be made or used false records for purposes of presenting false claims to the detriment of the federal or state government; - the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and other healthcare products covered by the three federal healthcare assistance programs, Medicare, Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), to collect and track all financial relationships with physicians and certain other licensed healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals and to report such data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in order to increase the transparency of financial relationships and eliminate potential conflicts of interests; and - the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and the respective implementing regulations, including the Omnibus Final Rule published on January 25, 2013 (collectively, the “HIPAA”), which prohibits the execution (or even attempted execution) of fraud or embezzlement against any healthcare assistance plan, including private health insurance, using any means and/or methods whatsoever. _Legal provisions on intellectual property_ The main sources of law in the area of trademarks, patents, designs and trade secrets are: (i) the “Intellectual Property Code” (Legislative Decree No. 30 of February 10, 2005), as amended and supplemented, (ii) the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of March 20, 1883, (iii) the TRIPS 202 ----- (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement, aimed at setting a common international standard for the protection of intellectual property rights, (iv) the European Patent Convention of 5 October 1973 and the related Implementing Regulation of 7 December 2006, and (v) the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) of June 19, 1970 and the related Regulations in implementation thereof. As regards trademark protection, the following, inter alia, should be noted: (i) the Madrid Agreement of April 14, 1891, as subsequently amended and supplemented and the Madrid Protocol of June 27, 1989, which provide for a unified procedure for the filing of trademarks in all designated countries party to the convention; (ii) the Nice Agreement concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks of June 15, 1957, as amended and supplemented; (iii) Directive (EU) 2015/2436 of 16 December 2015 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trademarks; (iv) Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the EU trade mark, as amended and supplemented, aimed at putting in place a trademark regime that gives enterprises the right to acquire, through a single procedure, EU trademarks that enjoy uniform protection and generate effects throughout the EU; and (v) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/626 of 5 March 2018, laying down detailed rules for implementing certain provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the EU trade mark, and repealing Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1431. The following is noted with respect to the legal protection of designs and models: (i) the Locarno Agreement of 1968 Establishing an International Classification for Industrial Designs, as amended and supplemented; (ii) Directive (EC) 98/71/EC of 13 October 1998 (harmonizing the legal framework at the EC level); (iii) Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs; and (iv) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2245/2002 of 21 October 2002 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 on Community designs (as amended). _Legal provisions on data privacy and security_ Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. _Legal provisions on product safety and product liability_ As regards aspects related to safety, the Group’s products are manufactured in compliance with national, community and international laws and regulations of the countries in which they are sold. In the EU, the Group’s products bear the CE mark, which certifies the products’ conformity to the requirements imposed. Outside of Europe, the Group obtains safety certifications for its products, requesting quality and product certifications from national or international notified entities or third-party institutions. The objective (strict) liability of manufacturers for damages caused to third parties by defective products introduced by Directive 85/374/EC was transposed into the legislations of numerous European member states. Under this directive, liability is excluded: the producer proves (a) that he did not put the product into circulation; or (b) that, having regard to the circumstances, it is probable that the defect which caused the damage did not exist at the time when the product was put into circulation by him or that this defect came into being afterwards; or (c) that the product was neither manufactured by him for sale or any form of distribution for economic purpose nor manufactured or distributed by him in the course of his business; or (d) that the defect is due to compliance of the product with mandatory regulations issued by the public authorities; or (e) that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered; or (f) in the case of a manufacturer of a component, that the defect is attributable to the design of the product in which the component has been fitted or to the instructions given by the manufacturer of the product. The Group has various insurance policies in place to minimize consequences deriving from claims for damages caused to third parties caused by defective products. 203 ----- During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and as of the date of this offering memorandum, the Issuer and the other companies of the Group have been involved as defendants in legal proceedings concerning claims for damages caused by defective products, as well as recall campaigns concerning the Group’s products. It should be noted, however, that such proceedings are covered by adequate insurance policies. For more information on the Group’s insurance policies, see “Business—Insurance.” _Information regarding any governmental, economic, fiscal, monetary or political policies or factors that have materially affected, or could materially affect, directly or indirectly, the issuer’s operations of the Issuer or the Group_ Demand for the products offered by the Group is influenced by the general economy, the economic trend, and the business context of the countries and markets in which the Group operates, and by its customers’ investment plans and production levels. Such circumstance means that the Group’s business and the market in which it operates are subject to a number of macroeconomic factors that the Issuer cannot anticipate, such as, inter _alia, (i) the high level of geopolitical uncertainty which - as of the date of this offering memorandum – continues_ to characterize a number of emerging countries of interest to the Group; (ii) the growing protectionist drives by, _inter alia, the United States of America, which could give rise to significant changes in customs, tax and regulatory_ policies and reduce the importance of the current free trade areas; (iii) the continuation or further worsening in Italian financial conditions or a prolonged political instability in Italy; and (iv) the exit of the UK from the EU and the end of the related transition period that took place on December 31, 2020. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Issuer is not aware of changes in laws or regulations in the various countries in which it operates that could have an impact on the Group’s business or results of operations. 204 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will: - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee (including that Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, if any); - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such other Indebtedness or obligation; and - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors. The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be Guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant 254 ----- Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law requirements being complied with. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the granting of Guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate to the benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable Guarantee. For a description of the Agreed Security Principles, see “Security—The Collateral” below. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee.

Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and Guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of those Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries (including non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.” As of September 30, 2022, after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries would have had €0.1 million of indebtedness. _Note Guarantees Release_ The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally terminated and released without any action by the Trustee or Security Agent, as the case may be, or the Holders of the Notes under any one or more of the following circumstances: (1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition; (2) upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all the assets of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture; (3) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the relevant Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; (4) upon payment in full of all principal, interest and other obligations in respect of the Notes or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “— _Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_ (5) upon the release of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered such Guarantor’s obligation to Guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Additional Guarantees”; provided that no other Indebtedness is at that time guaranteed by_ the Guarantor that would result in the requirement that the Guarantor provide a Note Guarantee pursuant to the same covenant; (6) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; 255 ----- (7) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”; (8) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; (9) with respect to an entity that is not the successor Guarantor, as a result of a transaction permitted by “— _Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Guarantors”; or_ (10) with respect to any Guarantor that is an Immaterial Subsidiary, upon written notice from the Issuer to the Trustee so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) does not Guarantee (a) any Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending commitments in excess of €50.0 million at the relevant date of determination or (b) Public Debt.

In particular, notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain _Covenants—Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including (but not limited to) if: - providing such security or guarantee would be prohibited by general mandatory legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance (including, without limitation, pursuant to articles 2358 or 2474 of the Italian Civil Code), corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “controlled foreign corporation”, “transfer pricing” or “thin capitalization rules”, capital maintenance, retention of title claims, exchange control restrictions, minority shareholder protection/equal treatment of shareholder rules and similar principles; _provided that the Issuer, shall use reasonable endeavors to assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to the Issuer or the relevant Third Party Security Provider or Guarantor and to overcome any such limitation to the extent reasonably practicable; - providing such security or guarantee would require the consent of any supervisory board, employee or works council (or equivalent), pensions trustee, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), minority shareholder or other external body unless such consent has been received; _provided that reasonable endeavors (taking into account any adverse impact on relationships with third parties) have been used by the Issuer or the relevant Third Party Security Provider or Guarantor, as applicable, to obtain the relevant consent; - (subject to certain exceptions) the time and cost of providing such security or guarantee (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, notarial costs and registration taxes, such as the Imposta Sostitutiva regime in Italy) is disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders; - the assets are subject to third-party arrangements which may prevent those assets from being secured (or are assets which, if secured, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations of any of Holdco, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of those assets or require such entity to take any action materially adverse to the interests of Holdco, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries); provided that reasonable endeavors to obtain consent to charging or assigning any such assets shall be used by Holdco, the Issuer or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in certain circumstances if the relevant asset is material and the Issuer determines in good faith that such endeavours will not involve placing commercial relationships with third parties in jeopardy, seeking consent from creditors or incurring any material cost; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no security shall be required over (and no consent request submitted with respect to) assets which are required to support Acquired Indebtedness to the extent permitted or not prohibited; - providing such security or guarantee would conflict with the mandatory fiduciary duties of the directors of Holdco, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their affiliates or contravene any legal prohibition or have the potential to result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any director or officer; provided that Holdco, the Issuer or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, shall use reasonable endeavors to overcome any such obstacle to the extent it can be done at reasonable cost; or - the assets are not legally and beneficially owned by the Parent, the relevant Third Party Security Provider or the Issuer or Guarantor (as applicable) or which are not located in a jurisdiction in which any Guarantor is incorporated or are assets of any joint venture, similar arrangement or any minority interest or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not wholly owned by another Restricted Subsidiary. The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations applicable to security providers and their shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such contractual 257 ----- limitations, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral _and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ The Collateral has been or will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral, including, on a first-priority basis, the Holders of the Notes, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “Certain Covenants—Liens,” the Issuer is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Notes, and the Collateral securing the Notes may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this issuance of Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—The Notes and _the Guarantees will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as Collateral.” Priority_ The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security Documents (the “Security **_Interests” and each, a “Security_** **_Interest”) as between (a) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture, (b) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, (c) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any and (d) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and the Notes are secured equally and ratably by first-priority Security Interests; however, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Notes will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after certain obligations including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) certain priority Hedging Obligations, if any, and (iii) certain future Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture, if any, have been paid in full. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “Description _of _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement,” “—Release_ _of_ _Liens,” “—Certain_ _Covenants—No Impairment_ _of_ _Security_ _Interest,” “—Certain_ _Definitions—Permitted_ _Collateral_ _Liens” and “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging obligations, if any, are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement procedure in priority to the Notes.” Security Documents_ Under the Security Documents, Holdco, the Issuer and the other Guarantors have granted, or will grant, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by, among others, (i) the relevant security provider, (ii) the Security Agent for itself and as agent on behalf of the secured parties, (and, with respect to the Security Documents governed by Italian law, the Security Agent also as Security Representative and legal representative (mandatario con _rappresentanza) and (iv) with respect to the Security Documents governed by Italian law, GLAS Specialist_ Services Limited as Noteholders’ Representative and the Trustee acting for itself and in its capacity as the Trustee under the Indenture. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, in relation to the Security Interests in favor of such parties. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents must be exercised by the Security Agent (including, in the case of Security Documents governed by Italian law, in its role as Security Representative). As a consequence of such contractual provisions and because the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security 258 ----- Agent in respect of the enforcement of the Collateral. See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements— _Intercreditor_ _Agreement” and Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes.”_ The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by the Security Interests until all obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release _of_ _Liens.” In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, Holdco, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including any and all dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of Capital Stock of the Guarantors that is part of the Collateral). The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Holders of Notes, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed, also for the purposes of Article 1704 (mandato con rappresentanza) of the Italian Civil Code, the Security Agent to act as its agent and mandatario con rappresentanza under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. Furthermore, each Holder will have deemed to have appointed the Security Agent as _mandatario con _rappresentanza pursuant to article 1704 of the Italian Civil Code to act on its behalf and as representative_ (rappresentante) pursuant to article 2414-bis of the Italian Civil Code. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Holders of Notes, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (as applicable) to: (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, confirmation, extension, renewal, replacement or discharge expressed to be executed by the Security Agent in its name and on its behalf. _Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_ The Indenture will provide that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the Holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and to give effect to its provisions. The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have: (1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; (2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents; (3) agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of GLAS Specialist Services Limited as common representative (rappresentante comune) of the Holders pursuant to articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code; 259 ----- (4) agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of GLAS Trust Corporation Limited as representative (rappresentante) of the Holders for the purposes of Article 2414-bis, third paragraph of the Italian Civil Code; and (5) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification, amendment, renewal by the Trustee or the Security Agent on its behalf). Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional _Intercreditor Agreements.” Release of Liens_ The Liens on the Collateral will be automatically and unconditionally released without any action by the Trustee or Security Agent, as the case may be, or the Holders of the Notes under any one or more of the following circumstances: (1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the shares of the Issuer) to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of _Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture (with respect to_ the Liens on such Collateral); (2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor; (3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”; (4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “— _Satisfaction and Discharge”;_ (5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary; (6) (A) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization, or (B) in a transaction that complies with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation,” _provided, in the case of this clause (B), that in such a transaction where the Issuer or any Guarantor_ ceases to exist, the Lien on the shares of the Issuer or such Guarantor will be released and, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will reattach (or a new Lien will be created) over the shares of the successor entity pursuant to a new share pledge (on terms substantially equivalent to the existing Lien on the shares of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable) granted by the holder of such shares; (7) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral, or the sale or transfer of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, in each case pursuant to a Qualified Receivables Financing; (8) in connection with any disposal of Collateral (other than the shares of the Issuer) to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such release is followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets in a manner consistent with, and pursuant to applicable formalities under, the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security _Interest”;_ (9) with respect to the Security Interests in respect of the Capital Stock of a Person or its Restricted Subsidiary to be offered, within a reasonable time to facilitate an Initial Public Offering in which such Person or its Restricted Subsidiary is the IPO Entity; provided that, such Security Interests so released shall be promptly granted or re-granted, as applicable, in favor of the Notes in the event that such Capital Stock is not sold or the Initial Public Offering does not complete for any reason; or 260 ----- (10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture. In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.” The Indenture will provide that any release of a Lien on Collateral shall, at the option of the Issuer, be evidenced by the delivery by the Issuer to the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer, and that, at the option of the Issuer, the Trustee and Security Agent shall acknowledge and confirm such release upon delivery of such Officer’s Certificate.

The Notes will mature on February 1, 2028 at par. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to threemonth EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor), plus 5.75%, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.4,"Agent”), which shall initially be GLAS Specialist Services Limited. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the",21.4.1,,"Issue Date or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for and be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on each February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2023; and be payable to the Holder of record of such Notes on the Clearing System Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date in accordance with, and subject to, the then applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System, or to the extent Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below) have been issued, to the Holders of record of the Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the interest period. Each interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date. Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Notes. “Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period. “EURIBOR,” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page or Bloomberg equivalent as of 11:00 a.m. London time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page or its Bloomberg equivalent does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m. London time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. 261 ----- Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any Interest Period the rate determined based on the procedure specified in this paragraph is less than 0.0%, EURIBOR shall mean 0.0% for purposes of determining the Applicable Rate for such Interest Period. In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no longer generally accepted in the Euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Notes will be any successor rate generally accepted in the Euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as identified by the Issuer in good faith; provided that, in the event that there is no generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Issuer, shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest (and any applicable adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders of the Notes as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR (the “Adjustment Spread”)) on the Notes; provided, further, that any such alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0.0%. Following the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative basis. The Issuer shall promptly thereafter notify the Holders of the Notes and (by way of an Officer’s Certificate, delivered at least two Business Days prior to the relevant Determination Date) the Calculation Agent of the new rate replacing EURIBOR, and the Calculation Agent shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate (without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever) as sufficient evidence thereof. Holders of the Notes shall be bound by any such alternative basis (and the Adjustment Spread) without any further action or consent by the Holders of the Notes or the Trustee; provided that if the Calculation Agent is unable (based on the information provided by the Issuer with respect to such new rate or Adjustment Spread (if any)) to calculate, or calculate definitely, the interest rate applicable to the Interest Period commencing immediately following notification thereof, then EURIBOR in respect of such Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent shall be responsible or liable for any action or inaction of the Issuer or its determination of such new rate. Nothing in the Indenture will require or oblige the Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to agree to any amendment or modification in connection with such new rate which may, in its opinion, expose the Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to any additional liabilities or increase in its obligations or decrease in its rights or protections. “Euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that have adopted the euro. “Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude May 1, 2023. “Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. “Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open. The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. London time on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each outstanding Note, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. The Calculation Agent will cause the rate of interest and Interest Amount for each Interest Period determined by it, together with the relevant interest payment date, to be notified to the Issuer and the Paying Agent. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted 262 ----- by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying whether the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted by any applicable law. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and - each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Payor will, upon request, provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent. Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) redemption price, purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration, or enforcement of the Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, (A) in connection with a transfer of the Notes after the Issue Date or (B) to the extent that such stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges 271 ----- or levies become payable upon a voluntary registration made by the Holder if such registration is not required by any applicable law or not necessary to enforce the rights or obligations of any Holder in relation to the Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited solely in the case of any such taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed on a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) or (5) through (8) or any combination thereof). The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice (the “Change of",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; 272 ----- (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer or cause an adjustment to be made in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to decrease the principal amount thereof; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its election, who shall in turn notify such agent as designated by the Issuer in accordance with the Indenture, the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been accepted by the Issuer and notified to Issuer’s designated agent and the Paying Agent, such agent or the Paying Agent shall promptly credit the bank account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of such Notes from such Holder’s Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) account. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repaid or repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer and its Subsidiaries. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. In addition, the definitions of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. 273 ----- The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

(3) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; (4) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph above or any clause of the second paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (7) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the first or second paragraphs of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence or Incurred by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors in compliance with the third paragraph of this covenant at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the 278 ----- principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing; and (8) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a revolving credit facility or letter of credit facility, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as applicable, for borrowings and reborrowing thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option as elected on the date the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, enters into or increases such commitments, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility, such letter of credit facility or such increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as applicable, is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as applicable) and for purposes of subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as applicable, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such commitments are outstanding or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date. For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness denominated in Euro, the Euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to Euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in Euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. 279 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee.

Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any agent) shall not be liable to any party for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation or Officer’s Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Notes, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (5) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. A notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice or instruction. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes, by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture or the Security Documents and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a non-consenting Holder). 302 ----- Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, the waiver of which shall require the consent of Holders holding not less than 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected thereby) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; (2) Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) and (8) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, comprising at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of such security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being so notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, concurrently with delivering its annual report pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports,” an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure 303 ----- to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery (prior to acceleration in respect of the relevant breach) of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

(the “Issuer”) will issue €295.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2028. The Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated as of February 3, 2023 (the “Indenture”), between the Issuer, GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and GLAS Specialist Services Limited as legal representative of the holders of the Notes (mandatario con rappresentanza) under the Indenture and common representative (rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code, GLAS Trust Company LLC, as paying agent and transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) and registrar (the “Registrar”) and GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as security agent and representative (rappresentante) pursuant to article 2414-bis, 3rd paragraph of the Italian Civil Code (the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate, include, by reference or otherwise, or be subject to the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Certain terms used in this “Description of the Notes” are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” In this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Issuer,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer only to the Issuer and any successor obligor to the Issuer in respect of the Notes, and not to any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative priority of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and Guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions. As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any future Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not Guarantee the Notes. The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, but this issuance of Notes is limited to €295.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Issuer may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Notes under the Indenture subject to the procedures and limitations described therein (as described below under “—Additional Notes”). The Issuer is a direct subsidiary of Emil Holding II S.à r.l. (“Holdco”). Certain of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer will, in part, depend on the cash flow of these Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Under applicable local regulations, cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries of the Issuer can only be upstreamed to their direct or indirect parent entities, including to the Issuer for purposes of servicing the Notes, to the extent that sufficient profits available for distribution exist within these legal entities and that they continue to meet relevant minimum regulatory capital requirements, as applicable. The Notes will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors. The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies to insolvencies which commence after 26 June 2017 (subject to certain exceptions). Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests.” The determination of where any such company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have differing and conflicting views. The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the centre of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the centre of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other EU member state. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the center of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the centre of the company’s operations. If the centre of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction (subject to exceptions) to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. If the centre of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request 348 ----- to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU member state are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other EU member state. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or a public authority has the right to request the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex fori concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant EU member state so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency officeholder appointed by a court in a EU member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets. The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies in one or more member states of the EU (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for 349 ----- downstream security or guarantee (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing, or a security interest granted to secure, financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies.

However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the Security Documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral. Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court. Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a _società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Pursuant to article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code (as defined below), any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration are ineffective by operation of law. The new provision replaced article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code, according to which such payments would be required to be returned to the borrower. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw back actions in an insolvency scenario, see “Certain Italian Insolvency Laws Considerations—Judicial Winding-Up (liquidazione giudiziale)” and “Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. In addition to that, Article 292, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code sets forth that claims of entities exercising management and coordination powers vis_à-vis the entities subject to such powers and claims of the entities subject to such powers vis-à-vis the entities exercising them deriving from loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of judicial winding up of in the year before, are subordinated. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. 351 ----- As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a _società per azioni._ Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy or judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of (i) Italian bankruptcy law (i.e. Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16[th] 1942, as amended and supplemented from time to time, the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) and/or (ii) Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect period.

If challenged successfully, the_ guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, among others, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; 352 ----- - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e _decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to_ counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di _applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be_ deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso _del diritto);_ - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation, a receiver is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the court or, in case of judicial liquidation, to have the pledged assets assigned at a fair market value returning any excess to the judicial liquidation estate; the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding or bankruptcy/judicial liquidation proceedings; 353 ----- - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian Banking Act )) may not be enforceable; - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the secured creditor from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy (to the extent applicable after July 15, 2022) or judicial liquidation of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding or in case of a judicial liquidation the pledged assets can also be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/shares. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Articles 2901 and following of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and 354 ----- - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly-owned companies are involved. Insolvency laws and regulations have been replaced by a new crisis and insolvency code. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters (the “Legislative",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies, which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the Guarantor and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The following acts and transactions, if made during the suspect period or such other period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the noninsolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: - payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and - granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: - payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; - a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; - the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; - transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; - a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of “concordato _preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_ - remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and - payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called _fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried_ out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser. 369 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The two primary aims of the Italian Insolvency Code are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. The aim of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure (which remain available to large companies also in the context of the new set of rules, as will be further detailed below), is to maintain employment. These competing aims often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under the Italian Insolvency Code, the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a debtor upon a petition filed by the debtor itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2, letter (b) of the Italian Insolvency Code, is defined as the state of the debtor, manifested by defaults and/or other external elements evidencing that the debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a debtor is insolvent. The Italian Insolvency Code also introduced a specific concept of crisis, which is defined under Article 2, letter (a) of the Italian Insolvency Code as the state of the debtor such that it is likely that insolvency will follow, which is manifested by the inadequacy of prospective cash flows to meet obligations in the following 12 months. Both insolvency and crisis are factual situations upon the occurrence of which different instruments provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code may be activated. In cases where a debtor is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, a state of crisis/financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the debtor, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. The following debt restructuring and insolvency alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent debtors and, in certain cases, also to debtors experiencing an economic or financial imbalance such as to make it likely that a state of crisis and/or distress or their insolvency will occur. _Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_ Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. _Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code_ The _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa was originally introduced in the Italian legal framework by Law Decree 118/2021 and has been subsequently incorporated into the Italian Insolvency Code. It is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code requesting the competent court to confirm or modify the Protective Measures provided for pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code on the same day as the publication of the request in the relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the acceptance of the Expert (as defined below), and, if necessary, to enact the Interim Measures necessary to complete the negotiations, and (ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition asking the court to authorize certain acts in line with the provisions set forth under Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is a proceeding aimed at facilitating the recovery of companies which “despite being in conditions of asset or economic and financial imbalance _such as to make it likely that financial distress or insolvency will occur, have the potential to remain in the market, including through the sale of the business or a branch of it.”_ 370 ----- According to Article 12 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_ can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are undergoing a distressed situation with reference to their assets, their business and/or their financial situation, such that it is likely that a distress/crisis or insolvency will follow. It is, therefore, a procedure aiming at anticipating further deterioration of the debtor’s situation. Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code, inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa (i) shall certify that no judicial windingup proceedings or similar proceedings are pending towards itself nor requests for the admission to the procedures provided for under Articles 40 of the Italian Insolvency Code, including pursuant to Articles 44, paragraph 1, letter a) and 54, paragraph 3, have been previously filed and (ii) in the event that the application for a composizione _negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is dismissed, other than the case where such dismissal is requested_ by the entrepreneur, may not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after dismissal. Pursuant to Article 25 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_ may also apply to group of companies, which may commence one proceeding all together. It should be noted that paragraph 9 of such provision provides for the group companies—at the end of the negotiations—to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 23, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code as a group, or use one of the tools referred to under Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, both separately or as a whole group. The _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_ is commenced on a voluntary basis only, filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and independent expert to the Secretary General of the relevant Chamber of Commerce by way of a dedicated electronic platform (the “Expert”). Pending a procedure for over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No 3 of 27 January 2012 (i.e., procedimenti di composizione della _crisi da sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio), the petition cannot be filed. Pursuant to Article 16_ of the Italian Insolvency Code the person who acted as Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following the termination of the negotiated proceeding. The Expert is appointed within five days upon the filing of the request. The Expert is responsible for facilitating and managing the negotiations between the company, its creditors and any other interested parties, in order to identify a solution to overcome the crisis or the insolvency, including through the transfer of the business or a branch thereof. The Expert assesses his/her own independence, the adequacy of his/her own professional expertise and his/ her own time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is positive, notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the Platform. In case of negative outcome, the Expert confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a new Expert. If the Expert accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are concrete and real chances of recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally, and can be assisted by its advisors. If the Expert finds that there are concrete and real chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. The entrepreneur must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation and manage his/her assets without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and, in case of credit assignment and/or transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations actively and in an informed manner, and the access to the _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_ does not, by itself, constitute ground for withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions apply to negotiations involving employment contracts. If the Expert finds that there are no real chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue up to further 180 days (pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 7 of the Italian Insolvency Code) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 19 and/ or Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code. 371 ----- Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 8 of the Italian Insolvency Code, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any) which declares the termination of their related effects. Pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures, which may also be limited, upon entrepreneur request, to certain creditors’ claims or to a specific category of creditors. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for the composizione negoziata, the ruling of opening the judicial winding-up proceeding (sentenza di apertura della liquidazione giudiziale) or the declaration of the insolvency of the entrepreneur cannot be declared insolvent by the court, provided that the court revokes the Protective Measures. The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. However, the creditors may suspend the fulfilment of the pending contracts from the publication of the petition requesting Protective Measures to the obtainment of such Protective Measures. If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), it must simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures will be ineffective. The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days, given that the judge may discretionary order the revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their duration. During the procedure the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company, subject to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to Article 21 of the Italian Insolvency Code, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments nonconsistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities. If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. At the request of the entrepreneur, one or more creditors or the Expert, the Court that has granted the Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures may, at any time, revoke such measures or reduce their duration when they do not meet the aim of ensuring the positive outcome of the negotiations or they appear disproportionate in relation to the prejudice caused to the creditors, pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code. If the Protective Measures are revoked, the prohibition of the obtainment of preemption rights by preexisting creditors ceases to be effective for the date on which the Protective Measure has been revoked. Pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize: 372 ----- a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new supersenior indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) via shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article 2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, without prejudice to Article 2112 of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking also into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect all the interests involved. The court shall also verify the compliance with the competitiveness principle in choosing the purchaser. Pursuant to Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della _crisi d’impresa can terminate as follow:_ a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 25-bis, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years; b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code; c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided under Articles 166, paragraph 3, lett. d) and 324. With such agreement the Expert acknowledges that the reorganization plan (piano di risanamento) seems to be consistent with the composition of the insolvency and crisis of the entrepreneur. At the end of the negotiations, if none of the above mentioned agreement is executed, the entrepreneur may alternatively: a) file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Articles 57, 60 and 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The percentage referred to under Article 61, paragraph 2, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code is reduced to 60% if the achievement of the agreement results from the final report of the Expert. b) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code; c) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code; d) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code or in the so-called Prodi-bis procedure or the Marzano procedure; Furthermore, pursuant to Article 24 of the Italian Insolvency Code: (i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code shall maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), opening of the judicial winding-up proceeding (apertura della liquidazione giudiziale), a sanctioned restructuring plan provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code, a compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or simplified pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors agreement aimed at the liquidation of the debtor’s assets (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione _del patrimonio) provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code;_ (ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from 373 ----- claw-back actions pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code if they are consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made; (iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 165 and Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register pursuant to Article 21, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code or if the competent court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (iv) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. _Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio_ Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio)._ If, in its Final Report, in the context of a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa proceeding, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome (i.e. the entrepreneur has not been able to reach an agreement with its creditors) but have been conducted according to fairness and good faith and that the options provided under Article 23, paragraphs 1 and 2, letter b), of the Italian Insolvency Code are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file to the competent court where the entrepreneur has its center of main interests a petition for admission to the _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents_ listed under Article 39 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The petition for _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio_ is then published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the Italian Insolvency Code are produced. Following the filing of such application, the court (i) appoints a so-called “auxiliary” (ausiliario) to, _inter alia, express an opinion on the entrepreneur’s proposal; (ii) orders that the proposal, together with the_ opinion of the auxiliary and the final report of the expert, be delivered by the debtor to the creditors appearing on the list filed by the debtor itself; and (iii) sets the date of the hearing for the court approval (omologazione). Creditors and any third party which has any interests are entitled to object to the court approval (omologazione) within ten days before the date fixed for the hearing. If the court, having verified the legitimacy of the objection and the procedure, as well as compliance with priority creditor claims and the feasibility of the liquidation plan, finds that the proposal does not prejudice the creditors with respect to the alternative of a judicial winding-up liquidation and that, in any event, it ensures a benefit to each creditor, it approves the composition with creditors proposal by decree, by which it shall also appoint a liquidator. The court issues a decree of approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione _del patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and_ regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. With the approval decree, the court also appoints a liquidator. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. Pursuant to Article 25-septies of the Italian Civil Code, the liquidation plan may also include an offer by a pre-identified third party to transfer the business or one or more branches of the business or specific assets to such third party, even before the approval: in this case, the judicial liquidator, having verified the absence of better solutions on the market, may implement the offer. 374 ----- _Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani attestati di _risanamento) addressed to the creditors and prepared by debtors who are either insolvent or in a state of crisis,_ in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor and enrolled in the Register of Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro _dei Revisori Contabili) must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business_ data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the independent expert. The independent expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court reorganization plans and the relevant debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Also, Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided they are finalized at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. However, the possibility to adopt such tools to liquidate the debtor is disputed, as it is argued they shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness and the rebalancing its financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-judicial liquidation agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Insolvency Code provides that, should these plans fail, and the debtor be declared insolvent, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted on the debtor’s assets for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to any claw-back action (azione _revocatoria), including the claw-back action provided for pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, as_ provided for pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register of the plan, the report by the independent expert and the arrangements is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-judicial liquidation agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the reorganization plan (or the agreements entered into to implement it) is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it cannot be excluded that the abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of subsequent judicial winding-up, if the competent court were to assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it was certified by the independent expert. Unlike Italian Bankruptcy Law, Italian Insolvency Law sets forth specific rules regarding Out-of-court reorganization plans and the relevant restructuring arrangements entered into with creditors, which must be followed for the plans and agreements to grant protection against claw-back actions and potential civil and criminal responsibilities. More in detail, out-of-court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code must be supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and commercial situation of the debtor and which also needs to indicate, among others, the causes of the crisis and the new resources which will be made available to the debtor and the industrial plan. Moreover, they must be suitable for the purpose of assuring the restructuring of the indebtedness of the debtor and rebalancing its financial position and, in case of its failure and subsequent challenge (impugnazione) before an Italian court, it must not be deemed as being unreasonable. _Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) provided for pursuant to Article 57 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code may be entered into by the debtor with creditors holding at least 60% of the outstanding indebtedness, to be sanctioned (omologato) by the competent court. An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare and that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the indebtedness vis-à-vis non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms in a 120day term from: (i) the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of 375 ----- the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian Insolvency Code, only a debtor who is insolvent or facing a state of crisis (as described above) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication. Creditors and other interested parties may challenge the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled with the opposition (if any), the court will validate (omologare) the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 30 days of its publication pursuant to Article 51 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The Italian Insolvency Code does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the debtor or a third party carrying out the business, or the sale of the business, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Article 58, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code sets the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan. More precisely, in the event of substantial amendments to the plan before the approval, the report issued by the expert and the consent to the debt restructuring agreement expressed by creditors shall be renewed. The report shall also be renewed in the event of substantial amendment. In the event of substantial amendments after the approval, the debtor shall make such amendments as are appropriate to ensure the implementation of the agreements, by requesting the update of the certified report issued by the expert having the requirements set forth in Article 57, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code. In this case, the renewed certified report, together with the amended restructuring plan, shall be published in the companies’ register, giving appropriate notice to the creditors by registered letter or by certified email (PEC). The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. _The key features of a debt restructuring agreement_ With the petition for the approval by the court of the debt restructuring agreement (or at any time pending the procedure) the debtor may request to be granted any Measures (e.g. a stay of actions or the creation by creditors of security interest (unless it is agreed in the debt restructuring agreement) in relation to pre-existing debts, etc.). Such Measures can also be requested (i) pursuant to Article 54, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, to the court by the debtor pending negotiations with creditors (i.e., prior to the filing of the petition for approval of the agreement), subject to certain conditions, or (ii) pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for approval of the debt restructuring agreement includes the relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). No dispossession of debtor occurs in respect of a debt restructuring agreement, but the court may appoint a judicial commissioner to oversee the proceedings and must do so in case petitions for the opening of judicial liquidation are pending, when it is necessary for the protection of the parties who filed such petitions. It is a court-supervised procedure, which can take from a few months up to more than a year (the duration of the proceedings are generally influenced by challenges). Creditors entering into the debt restructuring agreement are not required to receive the same treatment (i.e., they are free to reject the proposal and to protect their interests otherwise) and no cram-down is applicable to third-party non-adhering creditors, who shall be fully re-paid within 120 days from validation (omologa) of the debt restructuring agreement (if the claims are already due and payable at such date) or within 120 days from the respective maturity date if such creditors’ claims are not yet due as of the validation date of such debt restructuring agreement as per respectively Article 57, paragraph 3 letters a) and b). The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing to be held no earlier of 15 days from the notification of the relevant filing. Pending such deadline, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the approval. At such hearing, the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for the approval are met. Pursuant to the Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreement by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their status and economic interests) and can request the 376 ----- court to declare that agreement binding on the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”). More in detail, debt restructuring agreements with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione ad _efficacia estesa) provided pursuant to Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code- which were previously only_ permitted in relation to debts owed to banks and financial intermediaries where such debts represented at least 50% of the total indebtedness - can now be applied to any category of creditors, provided that, inter alia: (i) all the creditors belonging to the same category have been informed of the start of the negotiations and have been able to participate in them in good faith and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation as well as on the restructuring agreement and its effects; (ii) the agreement provides for the continuation of the business activity either directly or indirectly pursuant to Article 84 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (iii) the claims of the consenting creditors belonging to a same category represent at least 75% of all the claims belonging to the same category; (iv) the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category to which the effects of the agreement are extended can be satisfied under the agreement for an amount not lower than the amount they would receive with the judicial liquidation being understood that a creditor may hold claims in more than one category; and (v) the debtor has notified the agreement, the application for court approval and the documents attached thereto to the creditors to be crammed down. The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the debt restructuring agreement is referred to in the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa. Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 61, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, a special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid. Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and its creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 62, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code has been appointed and certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii) the fact that the treatment reserved to non-adhering creditors is at least equal to the one they could obtain in the context of a judicial winding up, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations, have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same. In no case debt restructuring agreements provided for under Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code and standstill agreements provided under Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code may impose on the nonadhering creditors, _inter alia, performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities. Furthermore, Article 60 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the so called facilitated debt restructuring agreement (“accordi di ristrutturazione agevolati”). Such proceeding, is a particular kind of debt restructuring agreement which may be entered into with creditors representing as little as 30% of the total indebtedness (instead of the 60% generally required under Article 57, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code) provided that the debtor: (i) has waived the standstill on the payment of non-consenting creditors (usually provided for by law, for a period of 120 days from the court approval of the agreement or from the maturity date of the relevant obligations, in “ordinary” restructuring agreements); and (ii) has not previously requested to the court the granting of protective interim measures on the its assets. By virtue of Article 59 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors. 377 ----- The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Pursuant to Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis: a) the debtor may repay, in accordance with the relevant contractual terms, the installments due under a loan agreement which is secured by way of a security interest over the assets used in the business, provided that: (a) at the date of the filing of the application for admission to the composition with creditors, the debtor has fulfilled its obligations or the court authorizes the payment of the debt for principal and interest due at that date; and (b) the expert meeting the requirements set forth in Article 52, paragraph 3, of the Italian Insolvency Code certifies (i) that such payments are essential for the continuation of the business activity and functional to ensuring the best satisfaction of the creditors (as already required by Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code) and, (ii) that the secured claims can be fully satisfied with the proceeds of the liquidation of the asset carried out at market value and that the repayment of the installments due does not prejudice the rights of the other creditors; b) the court may authorize payment of the remuneration due, for the months preceding the filing of the application for the composition with creditors, to the workers employed in the business whose continuation is envisaged under the plan. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 73 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in case of revocation of the approval (omologa), the court, upon the debtor's petition, shall order the conversion to a judicial winding-up procedure. If the revocation results from acts of fraud (atti in frode ai creditori) or non-performance of the obligations arising under the debt restructuring agreement, the petition for conversion may also be proposed by creditors or by the public prosecutor. In case of conversion, the court shall grant additional time to the debtor aimed at supplementing the documentation and shall act in accordance with Article 270 of the Italian Insolvency Code. _Court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (as defined above) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of insolvency proceedings (so called “concordato preventivo”). Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess (included debts not yet due) of €0.5 million. Only the debtor can file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo with the court based in the location of the debtor’s main office. The debtor must file the petition together with, among others, a restructuring plan containing an analytic description of manner and timing of the fulfillment of the proposal and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for _concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register by the registry of the court and communicated to the public prosecutor. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for the admission to the concordato proceedings includes the relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). As already described with reference to debt restructuring agreements, at any time pending the proceedings, the debtor may request to be granted Measures, which can also be requested pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale), including through extraordinary transactions, such as 378 ----- the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes (which is mandatory in certain cases provided under the Article 85 of the Italian Insolvency Code), provided that each class is composed of creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic interests; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Save for the provisions provided for under Article 109 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 86 of the Italian Insolvency Code has provided that, in the context of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis (concordato con continuità), the plan may provide for a standstill for the secured creditors, which may extend up to six months from the date of sanctioning (omologa) of the composition with creditors proposal for the payment of secured creditors (creditori privilegiati) pursuant to Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code (i.e. employees, professionals etc.). Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 4, the Italian Insolvency Code, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that (i) with the relevant filing for such proceeding, external resources are contributed which increase the assets available at the time of such filing by at least 10% and (ii) the degraded secured creditors as well as unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage equal to 20% of their total claims. In this respect, it should be noted that resources contributed for the purpose of a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) may be distributed notwithstanding the provisions set forth under Articles 2740 and 2741 of the Italian Civil Code provided that such distribution complies with the 20% requirement set forth above. Resources contributed are considered as “external” when provided for any reason by the debtor’s shareholders without obligation of repayment or subordination, in relation to which the plan provides them to be for the sole benefit of the creditors. This provision does not apply to composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). Under the composition with creditors, there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly retains management powers under the supervision of a court-appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and the deputy judge. From the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato _preventivo, the debtor is entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its business, although extraordinary_ transactions require the prior written approval of the court. Provided that the abovementioned steps are taken, during this time, all enforcement actions, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. The accrual of interests is suspended for the same timeframe, except for claims secured by pledges, liens or mortgages. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the _concordato preventivo_ is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. Any act, payment or security executed or created after the filing of the _concordato preventivo application and in accordance with its rules and procedures is exempt from claw-back action. The debtor is also exempt from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 322, third paragraph (“preferential bankruptcy”), and 323 (“simple bankruptcy”) of the Italian Insolvency Code, in relation to acts and payments made in execution of the Composition with Creditors and/or in relation to finance provided under Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company have super senior priority (prededucibilità) in the event of a subsequent judicial winding-up (see Statutory priorities below). For details regarding super senior financing, please refer to the paragraph relating to debt restructuring agreements. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary and simplified petition pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code. For sake of clarity, under Italian Insolvency Code, the simplified petition may be utilised by the debtor also to access a debt restructuring agreement or a restructuring plan subject to approval by the court (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) or a _concordato. The debtor company may file such petition, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the_ proposal and all relevant documentation (or the debt restructuring agreement, or the restructuring plan) within a period assigned by the court (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial winding-up proceeding are not pending. If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may, among other things: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the 379 ----- activities under Article 106 of the Italian Insolvency Code (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a _concordato _preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned_ period. As mentioned above, filing the simplified petition, the debtor may request the application of Measures. Pursuant to Article 44, paragraph 1, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the simplified petition being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into judicial winding-up. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the “full” application, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and if appointed the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the simplified petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of the concordato preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) have super priority (prededucibilità) in case of a subsequent judicial winding-up. The concordato preventivo proposal may also provide, inter alia: (i) the continuation of the business by the debtor as going concern; or (ii) the transfer of the business to one or more companies (concordato con _continuità aziendale) as well as for a particular composition with creditors proceeding through which any assets_ that are no longer necessary to run the business of the company are liquidated (concordato misto). According to Article 84, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the _concordato misto qualifies as a_ _concordato con _continuità aziendale, regardless the “portion” of business for which going concern is envisaged. In these cases,_ the plan and the petition for the concordato preventivo must fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Existing contracts, even if entered with governmental bodies, are automatically not to be terminated by admission to procedure. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Under Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a debtor who files for a concordato pursuant to Articles 44 and 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code based on business continuity may request the court to be authorized to pay pre-filing claims relating to the purchase of goods or services if an independent expert certifies that they are essential for business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and schedules a specific period of time during which creditors can express their vote. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). Article 91 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, if the composition with creditors’ plan, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the court or the delegated judge shall order that for appropriate publicity to be given to the offer itself in order to acquire competing offers (offerte concorrenti). If expressions of interest are received, the court or the delegated judge, by decree, shall order the opening of the competitive proceeding. Furthermore pursuant to Article 91, paragraph 4, the judicial decree referred above establishes the procedures for the submission of irrevocable offers, providing that in all cases, among others, the following is ensured: (a) their comparability, (b) the requirements 380 ----- for the participation of the bidders, (c) the forms and timing of access to relevant information, (d) any limits on their use, (e) the manner in which the judicial commissioner must provide them to those who request them, (f) the manner in which the competitive procedure is to be conducted, (g) the minimum increase in the consideration to be provided by the subsequent offers, (h) the guarantees to be given by the bidders, (i) the forms of publicity, and (l) the date of the hearing for the evaluation of the bids if the sale takes place before the court. With the sale or with the assignment, whichever is earlier, to a person other than the original bidder identified in the plan, the latter and the debtor are released from their obligations towards each other and accordingly the debtor shall amend the proposal and plan in accordance with the outcome of the competitive proceeding. The concordato preventivo is voted on within the period of time scheduled by the court and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, or (b) the majority of the receivables admitted to vote is reached the majority of the classes. Pursuant to Article 109, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in case one creditor holds more than the majority of receivables admitted to voting, it is also necessary to reach majority by headcount. The _concordato preventivo_ is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the _concordato_ proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. Among others, (i) the companies controlling the debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control of the entity controlling the debtor, (ii) the assignees of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the assignment has been perfected during the year preceding the concordato and (iii) creditors in conflict of interest are excluded from voting. The court may approve the _concordato preventivo_ (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the non-adhering creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions (in particular in comparison with the judicial liquidation). If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a nonadhering class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the _concordato preventivo_ if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case (including the judicial winding-up). The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by the social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when their positive vote is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 109, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also on the basis of the result of the report of the independent expert referred to in Article 88 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared to a judicial liquidation scenario. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 90 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan (proposta concorrente) to the debtor’s plan - within 30 days prior from the related creditors’ vote on the debtor’s plan - in a court supervised composition with creditors proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari), considering also that such percentage is reduced to 20% in case the debtor has filed for a composizione negoziata provided for pursuant to Article 13 of the Italian Insolvency Code. Differently from the general rules set out above, pursuant to Article 109 paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composition with creditors on a going-concern basis (concordato con continuità), is approved if all the creditors' classes vote in favor of such composition with creditors arrangement. In each class, the relevant composition with creditors’ proposal is approved if the majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted favorably, provided that the creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted. In case of non-approval, Article 381 ----- 112, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code shall apply. In this respect, it should be noted that secured creditors shall not vote if their claims are satisfied in cash, in full, within 180 days from the sanctioning (omologa) of the concordato con continuità and provided that the security interests supporting the related claims remains firm until the winding-up, functional to their satisfaction. In case of claims of employees or other claims secured under Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code, the delay is reduced to 30 days from the approval by the court. Pursuant to Article 112, paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, after the approval of the concordato preventivo_ proposal, non-adhering creditors (or creditors belonging to a non-adhering class) representing 20% or more of the liabilities may file an opposition (opposizione), challenging the economic convenience of the plan. In such case, the court has the authority to “cram-down” non-adhering creditors, compelling their acceptance of the plan, if it deems that the proposed treatment of their claims is equivalent to what they would recover in a judicial winding-up scenario. After the creditors’ approval, the court approves the composition with creditors and appoints one or more liquidators in order to execute the approved plan if it has to be realized by way of a transfer of assets. The court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. Pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the creditors do not approve the concordato _preventivo, the delegated judge (giudice delegato) shall promptly inform the court which, having decided that the_ appropriate conditions apply, shall declare the opening of the judicial winding-up proceeding. The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time to time, by the debtor are not automatically affected by the _concordato preventivo_ proceeding and normally continue pending the procedure, any agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to Article 97 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti) if the continuation of such agreements is inconsistent with the prospects and the execution of the composition with creditors’ plan, except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di _vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the_ concordato preventivo_ or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time _(a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are pending, renewable just once. When the composition proposal together with the relevant plan have been submitted, the suspension may also be authorized by the court for a further duration, which, however, may not exceed thirty days from the date of the decree opening the procedure, which may not be further extended. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the concordato preventivo procedure. Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the composition with creditors plan or fraud, provided that the relevant requirements are met, the concordato can be terminated or annulled, as the case may be, upon petition of one or more of the creditors and the judicial windingup may follow, at the behest of the relevant court. if the composition with creditors is implemented, terms and conditions of payments are amended as per the _concordato_ proposal, and the debtor may return to its usual operations (if the assets of the company are still in his possession). Concordato preventivo is compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of the application in the companies’ register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their rights against co-debtors and guarantors of the debtor. In case of non-minor breaches, the concordato may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial commissioner (in case of petition by one or more of the creditors). The relevant lawsuit must be brought within one year from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the concordato itself. The concordato may also be annulled upon request of the judicial commissioner or of one or more creditors in case a portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the liabilities have been willfully exaggerated. The relevant lawsuit must be brought within six months from the discovery of the concealment/exaggeration and, in any event, within two years from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the _concordato itself. Available financing forms under the Italian Insolvency Code_ 382 ----- The enactment of the Italian Insolvency Code did not change the main features of the previous legal framework set out in the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The aim at preserving the value of the company as a going concern and maximizing creditor’s repayment are the main goals both of the previous legal framework and the Italian Insolvency Code. However, the new provisions under the Italian Insolvency Code remove some uncertainties and clarifies some debated issues. In addition, the provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law focused mainly on the perspective of creditors already having claims against the company to avoid that the expectations of recovery of such claims were reduced due to the potential considerable increase in predeductible claims and, to this extent, granted a preeminent role to the independent expert together with the court authorization procedures. Unlike the former legal framework, the new provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code focus more on preserving the business value of the distressed company as a going concern by strengthening the key role of the financing of the debtor in the context of the relevant proceedings. The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo). The main features of the provisions concerning different available financings under the Italian Insolvency Code are set out below. _Interim financing - Article 99 Paragraph 1 to 4 Italian Insolvency Code_ Pursuant to Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, also in cases in which business continuity is maintained exclusively in a view of liquidation, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 57 (or Article 60 or 61) of the Italian Insolvency Code or a petition pursuant to Article 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code (in relation to the court-supervised composition with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness, subject to the court’s authorization with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that: (i) the petition specifies (A) the purpose of the financing; (B) that the debtor is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (C) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern or to the proceedings; and (ii) the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing are functional to the continuity of the business activities until the sanctioning (omologa) of the relevant insolvency proceedings or to the opening of the proceedings or to conduct them and, in any case, are aimed at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors. The expert report is not necessary in case the court recognizes that there is the urgent need to avoid an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern. In the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding (liquidazione _giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case_ the petition or the expert report contain false data or omit important information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement. _Bridge Financings - Article 99 Paragraph 5 Italian Insolvency Code_ Pursuant to Article 99, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, financings (together with the related claims) granted, in any form, in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) (finanza ponte), may be granted such priority status provided that (i) they meet the requirements of Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2 (described above), and (ii) it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the approval of the _concordato preventivo. The indebtedness under such financing option may be secured, subject to the court’s authorization, with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims. _Implementation financing - Article 101 Italian Insolvency Code_ In restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, pursuant to Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency Code, any financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors) sanctioned by the competent court and expressly provided 383 ----- for in the relevant plan, enjoy super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent judicial liquidation, save for the below (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing, unless the lender has become a shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring agreement or of the supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors, as in such case the priority status is afforded to 100% of the financing) according with the provisions set forth in Article 221 of Italian Insolvency Code. In the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the composition plan or the debt restructuring agreement, on the basis of an assessment to be made at the time of the relevant filing, results to be based upon false data or omission of relevant information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement. _The shareholders' financing – Art. 102 Italian Insolvency Code_ Pursuant to Art. 102, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code super senior ranking status also applies to any financings made available by shareholders in any form (including any guarantee facility or granting counter-indemnities) up to 80% of their amount. Paragraph 2 of Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code clarifies that, to the extent the financing is made available by an entity becoming a shareholder in the context of and by way of implementation of a composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement, all the claims deriving from such financings benefit of super senior ranking status and the 80% threshold limitation set out in Paragraph 1 does not apply. _Super senior ranking - Art. 99 Paragraph 6 and 101 Paragraph 2 Corporate Crisis and Insolvency Code_ Super senior ranking (prededucibilità) of the claims is the most relevant feature of bridge financings, interim financings and implementation financings as described in the paragraphs above. Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the claims deriving from such financings are expressly qualified as super senior by law and by Article 6(2) of the Italian Insolvency Code which clarifies that their super senior ranking natures continues in the context of any subsequent insolvency or enforcement proceedings (including in a judicial liquidation or any so-called minor proceedings). As already explained above, super senior ranking nature of such financings will be excluded in case of acts of fraud (which may be relevant also in the context of debt restructuring agreements). Such limit to super senior ranking is regulated differently for interim financings and bridge financings on the one side and for the implementation financings on the other side. More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant information are relevant when found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or the attestation of the independent expert, whilst for implementation financings such elements are relevant when on included in plan underlying the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement. With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, Article 99 Paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation, such financings (although authorized by the court in the context of the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement) do not benefit from super senior ranking when it is proved (jointly) that: a) the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant information, or when the debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization; and b) the receiver proves that the entities who provided the financing, at the date of issuance, knew the aforementioned circumstances. With reference to implementation financings, the relevant provisions are set out in Article 101 Paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code providing that such financings do not benefit from the super senior ranking, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation (alternatively): 384 ----- a) when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the petition for the opening of the proceeding, the plan underlying the composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement turns out to be based on false data or on the omission of relevant information; or b) when the debtor has carried out acts of fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that the lenders providing the financings were aware of such circumstances at the time of the establishment of the financings. _Restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione)_ An important novelty concerns the crisis regulation procedures governed by Title IV of Part I of the Italian Insolvency Code, is the new figure of the restructuring plan subject to homologation _(piano di _ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) (the so-called “PRO”, the rules of which are set out in the new Articles_ 64-bis and 64-ter of the Italian Insolvency Code). This new tool, takes the form of a restructuring framework that may disregard the distribution rules of regular insolvency proceedings but can be enacted provided that strict requirements are met. In this regard, it should be noted that recourse to this instrument will be reserved for a debtor in crisis or insolvent that plans to satisfy its creditors by dividing them into classes according to homogeneous legal positions and economic interests. This instrument allows the plan’s proceeds to be distributed even in derogation of the principle of “par _condicio creditorum” (i.e. the equal treatment of creditors), provided that the proposal is approved by unanimous_ consent of the classes. A judgement of admissibility is provided for by the court, which is called upon to assess the proposal’s timeliness and to verify the correctness of the class formation criteria. Application for the approval by the court of a restructuring plan must follow the steps of the common framework applicable to all restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e. concordato preventivo, debt restructuring agreement and also to judicial winding-up). The regulation of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), from the date of submission of the application until its approval, is based on the model of the negotiated crisis settlement: the entrepreneur maintains the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company in the prevailing interest of the creditors under the supervision of the court commissioner. The debtor is, in any case, allowed to amend the application at any time, formulating the proposal of composition (concordato preventivo). In that case, the time limit for approval is shortened. Similarly, the debtor that has filed an application for composition with creditors may amend the application by applying for approval of the restructuring plan provided that the application is made before voting commences. In each class, the proposal is approved if a majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted in favor, provided that creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted. The court will approve the restructuring plan in the event of approval by all classes. If a dissenting creditor objects to the proposal, the court will approve and homologate the restructuring plan if the proposal satisfies the claim to a not lesser extent than the one resulting from a judicial liquidation. A creditor that has not objected to the lack of convenience in its observations may not file an objection referred before, unless it proves such the lack of objection was due to a cause not attributable to it. In summary the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) thus represents for the debtor an opportunity instrument which minimizes the admissibility phase, providing greater freedom of action, but requiring the approval of all classes of creditors in order to be effectively approved. Against the judgment of the court ruling on the approval of the restructuring plan subject to homologation _(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal to the competent court of_ appeal within the term of 30 days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court. _Court-supervised composition for small debtors_ The Italian Insolvency Code provides for a simplified court-supervised composition in case the debtor does not meet the dimensional requirements to access other restructuring tools. Procedural steps and effects do essentially mimic those of the concordato preventivo, but it entails the involvement of the board for crisis settlement (organismo di risoluzione della crisi), which assists the debtor in preparing the paperwork and filing the petition, and performs the activities and duties which, in a concordato _preventivo are prerogatives of the judicial commissioner._ 385 ----- _Judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale)_ The judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale) is a court-supervised procedure for the liquidation of an insolvent company’s assets and for the distribution of the related proceeds. It results in the company’s liquidation. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also evidenced by defaults and/or external elements, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. The judicial winding-up is declared by the competent court and is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Pursuant to Article 37 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the request to commence the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by (i) the debtor company itself, (ii) the administrative bodies and authorities that have control and supervisory functions over the company, (iii) by one or more of the debtor’s creditors and (iv) in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. Upon the commencement of judicial winding-up proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as secured claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the judicial receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the judicial receiver (curatore) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or her decision; - the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments made or received by the insolvent debtor are immediately suspended and formalities with third parties that have been carried out after the declaration of insolvency are not effective as regards the creditors of the debtor (Article 145 of Italian Insolvency Code); - the debtor is dispossessed, and the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the judicial receiver (curatore). The debtor may no longer validly act in court as claimant or defendant in relation to the assets (Article 142 of the Italian Insolvency Code). The judicial receiver is vested with such powers upon the authorization of the delegated judge. However, all pending proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically stayed from the date the adjudication is issued and need to be re-initiated by or against the judicial receiver; - the beginning of the judicial winding-up involves the cessation of all the activities of the company with a view to a sale of all assets. However, continuation of business may be authorized by the court if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors. If the competent court authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa), the management of the business is entrusted to the judicial receiver (who may in turn avail himself of qualified third parties for this purpose); - certain payments made, security interests given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a certain period before the debtor’s submission to a judicial winding-up procedure (varying from six months 386 ----- to two years) can be set aside and clawed back if certain conditions are met (provided for pursuant to Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code); - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the insolvency declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for the Italian Insolvency Code. In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a written petition requiring the Court to give the judicial receiver (curatore) a deadline of no more than 60 days; within such deadline, the receiver must decide to enter into the agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the deadline without the judicial receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement is deemed terminated. Although the general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code. Judicial winding-up proceedings, as per the former bankruptcy proceedings under Italian Bankruptcy Law, are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed judicial receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori). The judicial receiver is not a representative of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate property. Furthermore, the parties of a judicial winding-up proceeding as well as any interested party, may file an appeal (opposizione) to the decree closing the judicial winding-up proceeding within 30 days after having been notified of the same. - **Composition with creditors in judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale). Pursuant to Article 240 of the Italian Insolvency Code, judicial liquidation proceedings can terminate prior to the actual judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) of the debtor, through a proposal for a composition with creditors in judicial liquidation. By way of preliminary note, such agreement occurring in the context of a judicial liquidation proceeding (i) replaced the former proceeding defined as “concordato fallimentare”, a composition with creditors agreement occurring in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding (fallimento) formerly provided for under Article 124, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (ii) should be kept distinct from the concordato preventivo, which is an independent insolvency proceeding. This particular composition with creditor agreement arrangement benefits in a certain way both the debtor as well as the creditors, in fact while the former is released of the debts falling into the relevant plan also regaining free disposal of his assets, the latter is satisfied faster and to a greater extent than they would have been with the full completion of the judicial liquidation process pertaining to the debtor’s assets. The creditor, a third party or the debtor himself formulates a proposal having as its object a “plan” to satisfy creditors, including preferential creditors, in full or in part. In case the _concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is proposed by the debtor, such proposal, inter alia, (i)_ shall be filed after 1 year from the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding and (ii) shall provide for the contribution by the debtor of resources that increase the value of the debtor’s assets by at least 10%. Such proposal shall be submitted to the competent judge, shall then be approved by the creditors and finally by the court. In case the court’s decree approving the concordato nella liquidazione _giudiziale becomes final (definitivo), the court declares the judicial liquidation to be closed and_ terminated, initiating the enactment phase of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale. In the context of a concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale, the competent court supervises both the proposal and execution phases while the judicial receiver (curatore), once the liquidation is closed, loses his management functions and retains only supervisory duties over the fulfillment of the terms and the conditions of the arrangement obligations arising from or in connection with 387 ----- the aforementioned concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale. Pursuant to Article 240, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal may provide for: (i) the division of creditors into classes, according to homogeneous legal position and economic interests. Under the relevant provision, such division is not mandatory but discretionary, provided two criteria for the class identification: (a) legal position, i.e., the nature of the claim, e.g., unsecured or preferential and (b) the homogeneous economic interests. In this respect, the Italian Insolvency Code requires for the criteria and rationale for the division into classes to be expressly stated in order to avoid the distorted use of class formation, put in place for the sole purpose of obtaining the approval of the abovementioned proposal; (ii) differential treatment between creditors belonging to different classes, indicating the reasons of such differences; (iii) the restructuring of the financial indebtedness of the debtor as well as the satisfaction of claims in any form possible, by way of example: a) by assignment of assets; b) by assumption (accollo); c) by means of other extraordinary transactions, including the assignment to creditors (as well as to companies in which they have an interest), of shares, quotas or bonds, including those convertible into shares or other financial instruments and debt securities. It should be noted that a special feature of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is the option to provide that secured creditors may not be satisfied in full. However, it is necessary for the plan to provide for their satisfaction to a non-lesser extent than that the one which can be realized, by reason of preferential placement, from the relevant proceeds in the event of a judicial liquidation, having regard to the market value attributable to the assets or rights over which the cause of pre-emption exists. The _concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale_ proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the simple majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in the majority of the classes). However, in the event of dissent by more than one creditor’s class, a cram-down may occur (i.e. in case the court decides to approve the concordato - despite a creditor belonging to a dissenting class contests the appropriateness of the proposal - if it finds that the claims can be satisfied by the concordato to a non-lesser extent than the practicable alternatives. Final court confirmation and sanctioning (omologazione) is also required. Finally, once approved and sanctioned (omologato) by the court the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale_ is mandatory: (i) for all existing creditors prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding; and (ii) for creditors who have not applied for the admission to the judicial liquidation estate, to whom the guarantees or the security interests given in the concordato nella liquidazione _giudiziale by third parties do not extend._ With the termination of the judicial liquidation - as a consequence of the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa), which pursuant to Article 247 of the Italian Insolvency Code may be challenged and appealed within 30 days from its notification - the debtor returns “in bonis” and enjoys the renewed availability of its assets. - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Insolvency Code may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. The proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure) as better identified in Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after 388 ----- the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the debtor’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian judicial liquidation estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire debtor’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. In particular, pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in addition to claims expressly qualified as “prededucibili” under Italian law, among others, the following claims are “prededucibili”: (i) claims relating to expenses and fees for services rendered by the business crisis settlement body; (ii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing for the approval of a restructuring plan subject to homologation, the debt restructuring agreements and for the application for protective measures, to the extent of 75% of the assessed claim and provided that the abovementioned plan or agreements are approved and homologated; (iii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing of for a court supervised composition with creditors procedure as well as the filing of the related proposal and the plan accompanying it, within the limits of 75% of the ascertained claims and provided that the proceedings are opened pursuant to Article 47 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (iv) claims legally arisen in connection with insolvency proceedings for the management of the debtor’s assets and the continuation of the business of the company as well as arising from the professional services required by the related bodies. - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Italian Insolvency Code is the equal treatment of all creditors (“par condicio creditorum”), according to which, absent statutory priorities or security right, no creditor may be paid a higher percentage of his claim than other creditors. A consequence of this principle is not only that the payment of debts by the judicial receiver is strictly regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor over the previous year (or, in certain cases, over the previous six months) are scrutinized and potentially unwound as preferential. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, _inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of insolvency. The key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in judicial winding-up compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In insolvency proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period of up to two years (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Insolvency Code distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective _vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the_ 389 ----- opening of the judicial winding-up procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding or in the prior two-year period ; and (B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors. - **Acts that may be avoided at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the debtor as provided for by Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: (i) onerous transactions carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year, where the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the debtor exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; (ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor which were not paid in cash or by other customary means of payment which were carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year; (iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the year prior, in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and (iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the six months prior in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted. Furthermore, payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions and/or granting of priority rights/security interests for debts simultaneously created (event those of third parties) may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective, if the judicial receiver proves that the other party knew of the debtor’s state of insolvency and if made by the debtor after the filing of the petition followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation or during the prior six months. The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: (i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; (ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the entity’s debt towards the bank; (iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, in force as of the date of this offering memorandum, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; (iv) transactions entered into, payments made or guarantees granted with respect to the debtor’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano attestato di risanamento (see “Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to _Articles 56 or 284 of the Italian Insolvency Code” above);_ (v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security interests granted in the 390 ----- context of a court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), of a restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad _omologazione) provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code or of_ sanctioned debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei _debiti omologati) and/or transactions entered into, payments made and security interests_ legitimately granted by the debtor after the filing of the application for a _concordato _preventivo or of an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti (see above);_ (vi) remuneration payments to the entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and (vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring framework (see below under “pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione _della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società)”) or to other insolvency procedures provided for_ pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code. Pursuant to Article 170 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the limitation period for initiating clawback action proceedings is three years from the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or, if earlier, five years from the act or transaction to be clawed back. In case judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from the date in which such petition is filed. In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. In this respect, under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the debtor was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor for the purpose of prejudicing the creditors) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. The Italian Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intragroup transactions. Under Article 290 of the Italian Insolvency Code the limitation period of initiating intra-group claw-back actions (referring to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group that jeopardize the creditors’ interest) is extended to five years from the filing for judicial winding-up declaration. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” claw-back action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called _fondo _patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be_ carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser. Finally, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union. - **Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures.** One of the main novelties included in the Italian Insolvency Code concerns the definition of the organizational, administrative and accounting structures of a company which are deemed to be adequate under Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, required by the applicable regulations for the purpose of timely detection of the state of crisis and the undertaking of suitable initiatives by the debtor. Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code requires the entrepreneur to adopt an appropriate organizational structure in accordance with Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, for the purpose of timely detection of the crisis of the company as well as the timely undertaking of suitable initiatives to overcome the crisis and recover business continuity. However, neither the aforementioned Article 3, in its current wording, nor Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, as 391 ----- amended by the Italian Insolvency Code, contains a precise description of the parameters, conditions and characteristics that are deemed to be necessary/needed for the definition and especially for the identification of “adequate structures”. In this regard, Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code precisely enunciates, on the one hand, the purposes to which the measures and structures must aim in order to be considered as adequate for the timely detection of the crisis and, on the other hand, the relevant warning signs in relation to the same. In this respect, it is stipulated that, for the purpose of the timely detection of the company’s state of crisis, the measures and structures deemed to be adequate should make it possible to: (i) detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific characteristics of the company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor; (ii) verify the non-sustainability of debts and the absence of prospects for business continuity for the next twelve months as well as the warning signs identified by Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (iii) derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical test for the reasonable pursuit of the debtor’s financial recovery. For the sake of completeness and as set out above, it should also be noted that Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides an exact indication of the warning signs, identified, inter _alia, as follows:_ (i) the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 days equal to more than half of the total monthly payroll amount; (ii) the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an amount greater than the amount of receivables that are not past due; (iii) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past due for more than 60 days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any form for at least 60 days provided that they represent in the aggregate at least 5% of the total exposures; and (iv) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under Article 25_novies of the Italian Insolvency Code. _Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, companies must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for judicial winding-up proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase. Judicial Phase._** In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the procedure or place it into judicial winding-up. Administrative Phase._** If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic 392 ----- and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared insolvent. _Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (Ristrutturazione Industriale di Grandi Imprese in Stato di Insolvenza)_ Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company insolvent and open judicial winding-up proceedings. _Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_ A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), provided for pursuant to Article 293 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code, is only available for public interest entities such as statecontrolled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to judicial liquidation proceedings, save for a different indication under Italian law. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario _liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company by the relevant governmental authority (e.g., the Bank of Italy_ or the Ministry of Economic Development, which are competent for the filing of an application for a declaration of insolvency with the subsequent opening of the compulsory administrative winding-up proceeding). The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under insolvency proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for insolvency proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up. _Common rules for pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società_ In order to facilitate access and filing of restructuring procedures by the Italian companies, Articles 120_bis and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code have been enacted, introducing a set of rules applicable to all pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza). Among other things, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code and the purposes of a successful 393 ----- restructuring, the plan may provide for “any modification of the articles of association of the debtor company, _including capital increases and reductions, including with limitation or exclusion of the option right and other modifications that directly affect the shareholders' participation rights, as well as for mergers, demergers and transformations”. Shareholders, who may no longer have an interest in the company, are prevented from hindering_ the restructuring or even one of its stages. For this reason, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the shareholders, while retaining a right to information in relation to both the initiation and the progress of the restructuring process, may not remove the directors without just cause, as is the case for the statutory auditors of joint stock companies, also in light of the fact that under the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code it is not considered as being just cause for directors’ removal, the filing for access to the prejudicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) when the related legal conditions and requirements are met. However, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 5, shareholders representing at least 10% of the filing company’s corporate capital may make a competing proposal. The plan may provide for the formation of one class of shareholders or several classes if there are shareholders to whom different rights are granted by the by-laws, including as a result of the changes provided for in the plan. The formation of classes is, however, mandatory if the plan provides for changes that directly affect the shareholders’ participation rights and, in any case, for large companies and companies with widespread capital. In this context, special conditions for approval of the arrangement are set out pursuant to Article 120_quater of the Italian Insolvency Code when and if the plan provides for shareholder attributions. Specific rules are then provided to ensure that creditors’ interests are protected in all cases in which the restructuring tool envisages shareholders to retain a participation in the company with a certain value. Article 120-quinquies of the Italian Insolvency Code, regulates the execution phase of such measure. In order to avoid any obstructive attitude of the shareholders towards the approval of the restructuring tool, this provision expressly excludes the necessity for their approval and/or resolution on the implementation of such restructuring tool, by generally attributing the relevant powers to the directors or more specifically to the competent court, in relation to any amendment to the debtor’s by-laws which - being specifically provided for by the plan - do not require any discretionary resolution. Finally, it is stipulated that changes in the corporate structure resulting from the implementation of a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della _crisi e dell’insolvenza) shall not be considered as and constitute cause for the termination or amendment of any_ agreement entered into by the debtor with third parties. Articles 284 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code contain specific rules regarding (i) the access of a group to one of the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e _dell’insolvenza) aiming at unifying – to the extent possible – the relevant proceedings; (ii) liability lawsuits_ available to the receiver; and (iii) subordination of claims. _Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_ In a judicial winding-up proceeding, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period of up to two years (six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary clawback period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back (revocatoria) provided for pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the noninsolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation, at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken 394 ----- simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation, if the judicial receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. In case judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from the date in which such petition is filed. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantor’s Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents. It should be noted that: (i) under Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the debtor for no consideration are ineffective _vis-a-vis_ creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial windingup procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up proceedings insolvency declaration or in the prior two-year period; and B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors. In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.4,"Decree”), which enacts a comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters",1339.4.4,,"which came into force on July 15, 2022 (so-called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter, as subsequently amended and supplemented and including Legislative Decree No. 83 of 17 June 2022 implementing the EU Directive 2019/1023, the “Italian **Insolvency Code”). Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta _Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38— Suppl. Ordinario no. 6._ The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società) provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new crisis settlement procedure (composizione negoziata della crisi); (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) the adoption of definition of debtor’s “center of main interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings, (ix) the introduction of the new restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) among the restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società); (x) the regulation of adequate measures and plans to early detect a crisis with specific criteria to be adopted by companies and (xi) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. The Italian Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by, among others, (i) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020, (ii) the Italian Draft Legislative Decree on “Amendments to _the Business Crisis and Insolvency Code, implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1023” approved on March 17, 2022_ by the Italian Council of Ministers (Consiglio dei Ministri) and (iii) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022. Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Italian Insolvency Code has been initially postponed to September 1, 2021 by the “Decreto liquidità” (i.e., Law Decree April 8, 2020, no. 23, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on April 8, 2020 and converted in law by the Italian Parliament by the Law June 5, 2020, no. 40, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on June 6, 2020 the “Liquidity Decree”), and is now effective starting from July 15, 2022. Provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law continue to apply only to any filings for proposals of declaration of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato fallimentare) and any filings seeking for the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) or for the opening of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) filed or pending before July 15, 2022 (i.e. the effective date of the Italian Insolvency Code). 355 ----- Considering the above, the following is a brief description of certain main aspects of insolvency law in Italy as it stands now and in particular: (i) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the other ancillary applicable regulations in place until July 15, 2022 and (ii) of the Italian Insolvency Code after its entry into force. In particular, below is a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the other ancillary applicable regulations. The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet with ordinary means its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. In addition to the _composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato per la _liquidazione del patrimonio described below, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are_ available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies _Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali):_ Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it provides the debtor with significant advantages and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being very likely reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger various liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing temporary financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. _Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa (introduced by Law Decree 118/2021)_ The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021 requesting the competent court pursuant to art. 9 of the Italian Insolvency Law, to confirm or modify the protective measures (the “Protective Measures”), and, if necessary, to enact the interim measures provided for pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021 on the same day as the publication of the request in the relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the acceptance of the Expert (as defined below); and if necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures” and, together with the Protective Measures, the “Measures”), and (ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 asking the court to authorize certain acts, or to modify the conditions of certain contracts if, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur. The composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore _commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with reference to their_ assets, their business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow and it is likely that the financial recovery shall occur, notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian Bankruptcy Law are not met. Pursuant to Article 5 of the Law Decree 118/2021, inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a composizione negoziata della crisi (i) shall certify that no requests for the admission to a concordato preventivo procedure nor accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti have been previously filed to the court in such respect and (ii) in the event that the application for a composizione negoziata della crisi is dismissed, may not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after the aforementioned dismissal. Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi may also apply to group of companies, in order to provide for the possibility of the negotiated proceeding to take place in 356 ----- a unitary form. It should be noted that Paragraph 10 of such provision provides for the group companies – at the end of the negotiations – to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021 (as set out below) as a whole group or enter separately as single companies into the solutions referred to therein. The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with the filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and an independent expert (the “Expert”) which however, pursuant to Article 23 of the Law Decree 118/2021, is prevented for enterprises having filed to access the procedures, debt restructuring agreements and/or concordato preventivo, including (i) pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, (ii) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (iii) the procedures of over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No.3 of January 27, 2012 (i.e. _procedimenti di composizione della crisi da _sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio) pending such procedures. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Law_ Decree 118/2021 the person who acted as Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following the termination of the negotiated proceeding. If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s financial and business situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue for up to an additional 180 days (pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any), which declares the termination of their related effects. Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims. From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the entrepreneur cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent by the court. The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), he must simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures will be ineffective. 357 ----- The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days. The judge, in his or her discretion, may order the revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their duration. Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations or appear to be disproportionate compared to the prejudice caused to the creditors that file the relevant request. Pursuant to Article 9 of the Law Decree 118/2021, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities. If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. When Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court which may revoke such measures or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize: (a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) via shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect the interests of all relevant parties involved. Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as follow: (a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree 118/2021 if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years; (b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. In such case, the independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, shall not be required. At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Article 182 septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. 358 ----- Alternatively, the entrepreneur may: (a) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) file a petition for admission to the _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio pursuant to Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021, which pursuant to Article 11 of the Law_ Decree 118/2021 can be filed only following the end of the negotiations; (c) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in the so-called Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure. Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021: (i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory administrative winding-_ up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or concordato semplificato per _la liquidazione del patrimonio;_ (ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made; (iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register or if the court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021; (iv) payments and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions provided for pursuant to Article 216 and 217 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. _Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio (introduced by Law Decree 118/2021)_ Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio). If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have been conducted according to fairness and in good faith, and that the options provided under Article 11, Paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file, with the competent court of the place where the company has its registered office, a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which may divide the creditors into various classes. The petition for concordato semplificato _per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing_ with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 111, 167, 168 and 169 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply. 359 ----- The court issues a decree approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. _Out-of-court reorganization plans (Piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_ Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors or any public authority including tax authorities. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. _Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_ The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt restructuring agreements, subject to court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third 360 ----- party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di _ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._ The new Article 182-bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69 of May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan, inter alia, if any substantial change to the plan are is necessary or required before or after the homologation of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors, the entrepreneur shall make the appropriate changes aimed at the implementation of such plan, requesting (i) the independent expert to renew its report as well as (ii) the creditors involved in such debt restructuring agreement to manifest their consent the necessary amendments. The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182 octies, Article 182 novies and Article 182 decies, thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code. Pursuant to the new Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is reduced to the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (therefore implying that the plan must be adequate and capable for the full and timely payment of dissenting creditors); (b) does not previously file a petition for admission to the concordato in bianco pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and (c) does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a socalled “cram-down”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-participating creditors shall be satisfied to a no lesser extent than the liquidation alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a non-liquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category (and, therefore, affected by the proceeding) have been duly notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa) and the related documentation. If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of non-participating creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, non-participating crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it. 361 ----- Pursuant to Article 11 of The Law Decree 118/2021 the percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi. Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case, the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid. Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii) the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the recovery strategies undertaken by the debtor, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same. The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the standstill agreement provided under Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-participating creditors. Pursuant to the new Article 182-decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with nonlimited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court- supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (finanza ponte) or granted in execution of the composition with creditors (finanza in esecuzione) may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors. Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy arrangement with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. 362 ----- The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to the Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182- bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so-called _prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_ company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. _Court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a _concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and 363 ----- information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco). The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so-called _prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the superseniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge. The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The Composition with Creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015 364 ----- abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the _concordato preventivo_ proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the _concordato proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to_ meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato _preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such_ value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the _concordato preventivo_ (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for_ the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. Pursuant to article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti _preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application_ for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an 365 ----- indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. _Impacts of the COVID-19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings_ In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, inter _alia, on insolvency matters (in addition to the Law Decree 118/2021 mentioned above) in order to (i) preserve the_ continuity of companies throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and after its end, with particular regard to those that were trading on a going concern basis before the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of certain insolvency proceedings already pending during the COVID-19 pandemic or already approved by the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among such legislative measures, the Italian Government enacted the Liquidity Decree. According to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree the deadlines for the fulfilment of concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements provides, among other things, the extension of 6 months of the deadlines for fulfillment of the obligations provided in an approved concordato preventivo or accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologati based on a plan expiring after February 23, 2020 shall be extended by six month. In the procedures for the approval (omologazione) of a concordato and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), pending on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for the grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato preventivo in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a concordato preventivo in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Also, a set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/preinsolvency scenarios. The rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different company type) of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with respect to losses arisen in the financial year ended on December 31, 2020 and until the five subsequent financial years. This measure, originally provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree, subsequently replaced by Article 1, Paragraph 266, of Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020, is intended to address the risk that the impact of losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic on the share capital of companies push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following: (i) putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal liability as a result of the delay in complying with such obligations. _Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_ A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_ had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of 366 ----- liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - **_Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare)._** Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the bankruptcy’s estate (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. - **_Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims 367 ----- originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti _chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed_ according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. - **_Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, among others, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. Please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see_ “—Insolvency Test”). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the order of the President of the court appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the President of the competent court that appoints him or her, usually to 396 ----- facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually also accept to abstain from such action while they are ongoing. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods”). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. _Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable_ difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test”) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself. The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors/stakeholders will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings) against the debtor for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods”) if a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, is suing for payment, or does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to stay payment of its claim. In the latter case, the judge may, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, order the postponement or the rescheduling of the creditor’s claims that have not yet fallen due. A joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from grace periods so granted by the judge. The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any actions by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request of the debtor - following a hearing held for that purpose to which the employee representatives or representatives appointed by the social and economic committee (previously known as works council), as the case may be, must be convened – if: (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency; (ii) the terms of the conciliation agreement ensure the continuation of the business as a goingconcern; and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgment (constatation) as described above and, in addition: 397 ----- (i) the decision of approval by the relevant civil or commercial court, which should only disclose the amount of any Conciliation Lien (as defined below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the enforcement of the conciliation agreement, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the social and economic committee or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the court; (ii) persons that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and postcommencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including with respect to certain pre-commencement or postcommencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “Conciliation Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; (iii) in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be rescheduled or written off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted), not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed); (iv) when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; and (v) in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of occurrence of the insolvency (see “—Insolvency Test”), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (see “—Hardening Period”), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud). Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de _l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:_ (i) interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded; (ii) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings to impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliator if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement and, taking into account the conditions of its performance; and (iii) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code, a joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation proceedings pursuant to article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code or during the execution of the conciliation agreement pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code mentioned above. If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. Termination will however not extend to the provisions of the conciliation agreement addressing the consequences of such termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may also be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by potential recoveries made) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor’s business, in particular through a “plan for the sale of the business” a.k.a. a prepack sale plan (plan de 398 ----- _cession) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial_ liquidation proceedings. Provided they comply with certain requirements, offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may, after consultation of the public prosecutor, be considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtor’s rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before 3 months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones. Conciliation proceedings during which the debtor has drawn up a draft plan supported by a large majority of creditors that is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings. Although French accelerated safeguard proceedings are the transposition into French law of preventive restructuring proceedings in the spirit of the EU Restructuring Directive, they are defined in the French Commercial Code by reference to standard safeguard proceedings. As a result and for the sake of clarity, standard safeguard proceedings will be presented below before accelerated safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at_ which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested even if they have a limited right to challenge the court decision commencing the proceedings. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a courtappointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 12 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet _de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate to its creditors (or submit to the classes of affected parties – see below)_ that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or equity holders do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted or supervised by the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator. Management decisions in respect of disposals (acte de disposition) that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions considered to be important under statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security interests or settling disputes). If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements)_ before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, pursuant to Article L. 622-10 of the French Commercial Code, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or, (b) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the debtor would 399 ----- shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases, the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor or on its own initiative except in the case of (i)(b) above where: (i) the court may not act upon its own initiative, and (ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controller (“Contrôleurs”) (if any), the public prosecutor and the employees’ representatives (if any). In case of the situation described in (i)(b) above, the court would decide the conversion (i) at the request of the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor if no draft plan was approved by the relevant classes of affected parties or (ii) at the sole request of the debtor in all other circumstances. In case of conversion of the proceedings, classes of affected parties that would already be constituted before the conversion would remain with the same allocation and computation of the votes, subject to pending challenges. The process of constitution of classes shall continue notwithstanding this conversion. As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. _Judicial Restructuring Lien_ Persons that, in the context of accelerated safeguard, safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, provide new money (except through a share capital increase) (the “Judicial Restructuring Lien”): (i) during the observation period in safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings or the temporary continuation of business operations in judicial liquidation proceedings, in order to ensure the continuity of the debtor’s business during this period, in which case such financing must be authorized by the supervisory judge and are subject to publicity, or (ii) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (including a plan ordered by the court that substantially modifies a previous one), in which case the amount and the privilege must be specifically mentioned in the draft plan on which the affected parties are called upon to vote as well as in the court decision adopting the plan, enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims with the exception of (i) employees’ super-privileged claims, (ii) procedural costs, (iii) the Conciliation Lien, (iv) precommencement claims secured by security interests over real estate assets (only in the context of judicial liquidation proceedings) and (v) post-commencement wages claims not advanced through the French wages guarantee scheme (AGS) under provisions of Articles L. 3253-8 to L. 3253-13 of the French Labor Code. The Judicial Restructuring Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided prior to commencement of the proceedings. In addition, such claims may not be rescheduled or written-off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) without the consent of the relevant creditors, not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed), in the on-going or in subsequent safeguard proceedings or judicial reorganization proceedings. Creditors (and if applicable, equity holders) must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps etc.) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. _Standard Consultation_ Standard consultation applies in respect of debtors that, on the date of the petition for commencement of the proceedings (on a stand-alone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning 400 ----- of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) have less than (x) 250 employees and €20 million in net turnover or (y) €40 million in net turnover unless, upon their request, the supervisory judge authorizes a class-based consultation of their creditors (see below). In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the creditors representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the creditors representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap proposals which require the agreement of each individual creditor in writing) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de _sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were_ submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the ones applicable to claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates falling after the term of the plan, in which case the maturity dates shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim and, as from the sixth year, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 10% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if such date is later than the first payment date provided for in the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent. The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the modification is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the interested parties are consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following the receipt. Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate to debt writeoffs or debt-to-equity swaps. _Class-based Consultation_ Class-based consultation applies to companies that, on the date of the petition for commencement of the proceedings, meet or exceed either of the following thresholds (x) 250 employees and €20 million in net turnover 401 ----- or (y) €40 million in net turnover (on a standalone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code), or upon the debtor’s request and with the authorization of the supervisory judge if they do not meet such thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties (parties affectées), as defined below. Only the affected parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan. Pursuant to Article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code, affected parties are: (i) creditors whose rights are directly impaired by the proposed plan; (ii) equity holders (including shareholders and holders of securities giving future rights to the share capital) if their equity interests, the debtor’s articles of association or by-laws, or their rights are modified by the proposed plan. The court-appointed administrator is responsible for drawing up the classes and informing each affected party that it is a member of a class. The court-appointed administrator must, on the basis of objective verifiable criteria, allocate the affected parties in classes presenting a sufficient commonality of economic interest (communauté d’intérêt économique suffisante) in compliance with the following conditions: (i) creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles), in respect of their claims so secured, and other creditors shall belong to different classes; (ii) the class formation shall comply with subordination agreements entered into before commencement of the proceedings that shall have been brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator within ten days from his notification to each affected party of its membership in a class; (iii) equity holders shall make up one or more classes; and (iv) claims arising from employment contracts (including the French wage guarantee scheme (AGS) claims), pension rights, and maintenance claims cannot be affected by the plan and in respect of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor, only the amount of their claims that are not secured by such security trust is taken into account. The court-appointed administrator shall notify to each affected party the criteria for class formation and for the determination of the voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights allowing them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into consideration is the one communicated by the debtor and certified by its auditor(s) or, failing that, endorsed by a certificate from its chartered accountant. Future interest claims calculated by a reference to an index are calculated by reference to the value of the index at the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings. The claims of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) shall only be taken into account for the portion of their claim not secured by the security trust. Any affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors representative or the court-appointed administrator is entitled, within ten days following the notification of the criteria for the formation of the classes and the determination of the voting rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, to dispute the same before the supervisory judge. The supervisory judge must rule within ten days of the referral date, and failing that, any aforementioned person may refer the dispute to the court, which must rule within ten days of such later referral date. The supervisory judge’s decision (or the court’s decision, as the case may be) may be appealed by the parties within five days of its notification to the parties and by the public prosecutor within five days of its communication thereto. The proposed plan may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debt-for-equity swaps (subject to specific exceptions, including in respect of claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien). The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to the parties concerned (creditors, bondholders, equity holders) and are ultimately determined by the court-appointed judicial administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree. 402 ----- The classes must approve or reject the plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened by the supervisory judge, upon prior request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator, but may not be shorter than 15 days. The decision shall be taken by each class by a two-thirds majority of the votes held by the members casting a vote. If applicable, the class or classes of equity holders vote under the rules governing votes at shareholders/equity holders’ general meetings, except that the decision is taken at the same two-thirds majority. Once the draft plan has been adopted by each of the classes, it will be submitted to the commercial court which shall essentially verify that the following conditions are met: (i) the classes have been duly formed in accordance with the rules mentioned above; (ii) affected parties, sharing a sufficient commonality of interest within the same class, are treated equally and in proportion to their claim or right; (iii) the plan has been duly notified to all the affected parties; (iv) if there are dissenting affected parties, the plan meets the “best interests of creditors” test (i.e., no dissenting party is worse off as a result of the plan than it would be if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de _cession)) or in the event of a better alternative solution if the plan was not approved);_ (v) where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not excessively impair the interests of the affected parties; and (vi) the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected. The court may refuse to adopt the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the debtor’s insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The judgment adopting the plan renders the plan enforceable against all (erga omnes) (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). _Cross-class Cram-down_ The 2021 Ordinance has introduced a cross-class cram-down mechanism into French law: where the safeguard plan is not approved by a two-thirds majority of each class, it may be adopted by the court at the request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator (with the approval of the debtor) and be imposed on the parties that voted against the plan provided that: (i) the plan complies with the conditions for adoption of the plan by the court mentioned above; (ii) the plan has been approved by: (A) a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, provided that at least one such class is a class of creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles) or is senior to the unsecured creditors class (créanciers chirographaires); or, if such condition is not met, (B) at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than an equity holders’ class or any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, could reasonably be expected not to be entitled to any payment if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)); 403 ----- (iii) the claims held by a dissenting class of affected parties are fully paid (by identical or equivalent means) if a lower ranking class is entitled to be paid or retains an interest within the plan (i.e., absolute priority rule); (iv) no class of affected parties receives or retains, under the plan, more than the total amount of its claims or interests; (v) where one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not approved the plan, the plan can be imposed on such dissenting equity holders if: (A) the debtor (on a standalone basis or together with other entities which they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) meets or exceeds either of the following thresholds: (x) 250 employees and €20 million of net turnover or (y) €40 million in net turnover; (B) it is reasonably foreseeable, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, that the equity holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)); (C) if the plan provides for a capital increase to be paid up by cash contribution or by way of set off of claims, the shares issued are offered by preference to the shareholders, pro rata their shareholding; and (D) the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of the dissenting class or classes of equity holders. The court’s decision constitutes approval of the changes to the shareholding structure, to the rights of the equity holders, to the articles of association or the by-laws provided for in the plan. The court may appoint a judicial representative to perform the acts necessary for the implementation of these changes. Upon request from the debtor, or from the court-appointed administrator with the debtor’s consent, the court can override the absolute priority rule if it is deemed necessary to achieve the plan’s objectives and if the plan does not excessively affect the rights or interests of affected parties. In particular, supplier claims, equity holders and tort liability claims may benefit from such exemption. As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without court’s consent. If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the classes of affected parties, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead the debtor to shortly becoming insolvent. At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having voted against the draft plan and considering that: (i) the best interest test criterion has not been met; or (ii) in the event of a plan adopted by a cross-class cram-down and, based on the valuation of the debtor as a going concern, either (or both) of the following conditions has not been met: (A) in the event that the plan was approved solely by the vote of an affected class that was not an equity holder class, such class would not have been entitled to a payment if the order of payment in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, a court-ordered sale plan); (B) in the event that a class, or classes, of equity holders voted against the plan, it would be reasonable to assume that such class(es) would not have received a payment or 404 ----- retained an interest in the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or of a court-ordered sale plan) may petition the court to dispute the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the same decision, determine the value of the debtor (it being noted that the court is in charge of determining the said value, for the purposes of which it is entitled to order the appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the adoption of the plan. This decision may itself be challenged within ten days of its notification or communication to them, by the affected party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor. In the event no safeguard plan is adopted through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down), there is no statute that allows French courts to impose a term-out (i.e., a rescheduling over a maximum period of 10 years of the indebtedness of dissenting creditors) although the courts retain this power under statute if the plan is adopted under the standard consultation procedure (i.e., if no classes are formed) in safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings and, in judicial reorganization proceedings only, in case of failure of the class-based consultation (see “—Court_Administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”). Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines. Where the plan provides for debt write-offs or rescheduling affecting secured public creditors’ claims, the administrator can decide to gather those public creditors within a class (or classes) of affected parties called upon to vote on the proposed plan.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: (i) its financial statements must have been certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire _aux comptes) or drawn-up by a chartered accountant (expert-comptable);_ (ii) the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; (iii) as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome; (iv) the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern that is likely to be supported by enough of the parties that will be impaired to render its adoption plausible within an initial two-month period, that may be extended up to a total maximum of four months, following commencement of the accelerated safeguard proceedings, upon request from the debtor and the court-appointed administrator; and (v) the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied for commencement of conciliation proceedings. The debtor may request the limitation of the scope of the accelerated safeguard proceedings to its financial creditors only, if the nature of its indebtedness is such that a plan could be adopted by such creditors alone. 405 ----- If the debtor does not meet the thresholds above that require creditor classes (see above) to be formed, the court must order such formation in the decision commencing the proceedings. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and the provisions relating to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings. The plan, in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings, is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the class process and, in particular, cannot impose a term-out. The list of claims of affected parties, party to the conciliation proceedings, established by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor or the chartered accountant, shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings unless the affected parties otherwise elect to make such a filing (see “—Status of Creditors during _Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”)._",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it has not filed for conciliation proceedings in the meantime (as discussed above). De jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire), a controller, the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial_ reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the person(s) appointed by the social and economic committee (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months (instead of a maximum of 12 months under safeguard proceedings), and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan and may include a partial sale of the business), the partial or total sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. Differences exist under judicial reorganization proceedings in respect of class formation and the adoption of the restructuring plan. The main differences are as follows: 406 ----- (i) if the debtor does not meet the required threshold(s) the authorization to form classes of affected parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the court-appointed administrator on their own, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor); (ii) any affected party may submit a draft plan to the vote of the classes. The draft plan shall be submitted, together with the plan proposed by the debtor, at the latest 15 days before the date of the vote; (iii) if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void; (iv) if the plan has not been approved by all classes of affected parties, a cross-class cramdown may be requested by the court-appointed administrator with the agreement of the debtor or, unlike safeguard proceedings, of an affected party (meaning that the cross-class cram-down mechanism can be used without the debtor’s consent); and (v) in the event that plan approval through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by regular approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down) fails the approval of the plan may occur through the standard consultation rules (see above). In relation to equity holders, the following is also to be noted in the event of judicial reorganization proceedings: (i) in case a shareholders meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders equity to a level equal to at least one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may request the appointment a court officer (mandataire de _justice) to convene a shareholders meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to_ the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan; (ii) if (a) the debtor company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (b) the disappearance of the debtor company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment, (c) the modification of the debtor company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the debtor company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: (A) appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or (B) order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the debtor company’s shareholders meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the debtor company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. 407 ----- If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly unlikely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial sale of the business as part of a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession). At any time during the observation period, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the controllers (if any), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order a partial cessation of activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its reorganization is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes, both of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors: (i) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed, or remain in office if already appointed, to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a goingconcern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business. As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is usually at a significant discount compared to their in bonis market value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale plan that ensures the continuation of the business as a going-concern and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating the release of their security interests. By way of exception: (A) a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan (to the extent the latter have duly filed their claims; see “—Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial _Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”);_ (B) the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if the outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of the leased asset as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and (C) only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until they are repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless an agreement is reached with the relevant parties. Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their in bonis market value; or 408 ----- (ii) separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: (A) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères or _adjudication amiable for real estate assets only); (B) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the supervisory judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or (C) request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court orders a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the judicial liquidation proceedings when either: (i) no due liabilities remain or the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif); or (ii) continuation of the liquidation operations becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: (i) when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or (ii) in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors in full, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors. _The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings_ The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings, unless, in this decision or in a subsequent one, the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court. Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, any contractual security or contractual retention right granted for debts previously incurred (unless they replace a previous security interest of at least an equivalent nature and base and with the exception of the assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the date of insolvency), any statutory mortgage attached to judgments of condemnation constituted 409 ----- on the debtor’s assets for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures _conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock_ options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code. Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration, administrative seizure measures, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers _détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court_ determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew (or could not ignore) that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable”. There is no hardening period prior to safeguard proceedings or to accelerated safeguard proceedings (assuming the latter proceedings are successful). _Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_ Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, no. 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, except in accelerated safeguard proceedings the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its postcommencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a sale plan (plan de cession) as described above. In such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision ordering the sale plan, as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: (i) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); (ii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets (whether they are pledged, retained by a creditor based on a retention right or constitute collateral in a security trust estate (patrimoine fiduciaire) required by the continued operation of the business) or to pay a carrier requesting payment directly from the debtor); (iii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; security interests can be granted as regards such debts the payment of which is not prohibited, subject to prior authorization by the supervisory judge; 410 ----- (iv) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a Conciliation Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the mandataire judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; (v) creditors (or beneficiaries of a third party security granted by the debtor) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor or a person having granted a security over its own assets to secure the debtor’s debt, where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (A) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (B) to terminate a contract for nonpayment of amounts owed to the creditor; or (C) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such assets secure third party debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union at the time of the opening of the proceedings, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the Insolvency Regulation (subject to secondary proceedings that may be commenced in such Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if such proceedings were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party); (vi) any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention right: (by any means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration of securities or proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is prohibited; any contrary provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of the debtor not yet in existence on the date of the decision commencing the proceedings, will be held unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the increase in the base of a contractual security interest may however validly result from an assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a framework agreement entered into before commencement of the proceedings or from other specific contrary provisions of the French Commercial Code regarding restructuring and insolvency, the French Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code; and (vii) in the context of reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required. A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor (or a person having granted a security over its own assets to secure the debtor’s debt) may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan or of a judicial reorganization plan adopted by the court. In accelerated safeguard, the above rules would only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to creditors that are not within the scope of the proceedings continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors representative within two 411 ----- months of the publication of the court decision in the relevant official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des Annonces _Civiles et Commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan_ France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third party must also file a proof of claim with the creditors’ representative under the same conditions. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or chartered accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court orders a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a Conciliation Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and public creditors (i.e., taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority is not relevant to all creditors, for example creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset will be treated separately.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantor and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer to the French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantees. Any payment made by the French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by the French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, the French Guarantor’s obligation under the Notes Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or the French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantees. Additionally, to the extent that the relevant intercompany loans are subsequently repaid or cancelled, including pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement upon an enforcement, such Notes Guarantee granted by the French Guarantor will be reduced or fall away. No French Guarantor will be acting jointly and severally with the Issuer and/or the other Guarantors as regards its obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société _par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly_ established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of the French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. 413 ----- If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not be sufficient to satisfy the claims of the secured creditors and might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, there will be provided for the creation of ”parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. 414 ----- The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes.

September 13, 2011_ n°10-25533 Belvedere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of ""trust"" has not been generally recognized under French law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged (i) in the context of the insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the court-appointed safeguard or reorganization plan commissioner (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), or (ii) by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against all the creditors of the relevant debtor or the concerned creditor who lodged the claim (see below) if: (a) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (b) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (c) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a Notes Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Notes Guarantee could be (i) declared unenforceable against all the creditors of the debtor if the claim was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the court-appointed safeguard or reorganization plan commissioner (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) or (ii) declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Notes Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Notes Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In the event of insolvency of the Guarantor, or any of the Issuer’s relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany subject to the information presented under subsection “European Union”, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. If so, German law would then govern most, if not all, aspects of those proceedings. In contrast, pursuant to the Insolvency Regulation, where a German company conducts business in more than one member state of the EU and the company’s “center of main interests” at the time insolvency proceedings are initiated is found to be in a member state other than Germany (see “—European Union”), main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in that other member state. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) or the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions and, for example, may restrict creditors’ interests, including in respect of priority of creditors and the ability to obtain post-petition interest for unsecured claims, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes. See “Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or the Collateral _across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult.”_ The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany. Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings under German law with respect to a debtor incorporated as a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or any other corporation or partnership not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder, can be initiated by either the debtor or a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor. A debtor is considered illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due. As a guideline, a company is considered illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks. A debtor is considered over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets unless a continuation of the business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on a 12 month forecast horizon (positive _Fortführungsprognose), which is temporarily shortened pursuant to the SanInsKG (as defined below) to a four_ month forecast horizon applicable during the period from November 9, 2022 to December 31, 2023. Whether the debtor’s liabilities exceed the value of its assets must be assessed on the basis of an over-indebtedness balance sheet to be drawn up on the basis of the liquidation values. If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit _beschränkter Haftung—GmbH), a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation_ based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE), any other limited liability company or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management board or managing director or, under certain circumstances, the shareholder of such company is obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay (ohne schuldhaftes Zögern) but not later than three weeks after such illiquidity was established and/or six weeks after the establishment of over-indebtedness (pursuant to the SanInsKG (as defined below) this period is temporarily extended to eight weeks applicable during the period from November 9, 2022 to December 31, 2023) as the case may be. In addition, only the debtor can file for insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if it will most likely be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due during the course of a forecast period of (typically) the next 24 months, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets other than immovable assets during these preliminary proceedings and will, in almost all cases (ordinary proceedings), appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The duty of the preliminary administrator is, in particular, to safeguard and to 416 ----- preserve the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse), to verify the existence of a reason for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsgrund) and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Exceptionally, if a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted but is not yet illiquid and unless – from a third party perspective - there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring, it may specify in its insolvency petition that it is seeking to enter into one out of two possible types of preliminary debtor-inpossession protection schemes, including a scheme that is commonly referred to as protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren). Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger _Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets). The court may_ also resolve other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be implemented in debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after main insolvency proceedings have been opened. During preliminary insolvency proceedings a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger _Gläubigerausschuss) will (absent certain exemptions) be set up if the debtor satisfies two of the following three_ requirements: (i) a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over-indebted), (ii) revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the 12 months prior to the last balance sheet date and/or (iii) an annual average of 50 or more employees. The requirements apply to the respective entity without taking into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important insolvency court decisions. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: (i) the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator or an insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter_ _und_ _Insolvenzverwalter),_ (ii) orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung),_ and (iii) appointments of a preliminary trustee or a trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter or _Sachwalter)._ The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of insolvency proceedings if certain requirements are met, in particular if (i) the debtor is in a situation of illiquidity or impending illiquidity and/or over- indebted and (ii) there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse) following which the company will, inter alia, be deemed dissolved and put into liquidation. Upon the opening of main insolvency proceedings, the right to manage and dispose over the business and assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who is appointed by the insolvency court unless debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered, in which event the court will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. The creditors are only entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator by the court at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual is eligible as an officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the insolvency estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any liabilities created by the debtor (or a preliminary insolvency administrator/trustee prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (including secured debt, subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) and other security interests)). The insolvency administrator or trustee may, on the grounds of avoidance (Insolvenzanfechtung), also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings. For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of an opening of German insolvency proceedings against the German Guarantor would include, among others, the following: a) unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of the German Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the 417 ----- (preliminary) court-appointed insolvency administrator ((vorläufiger) _Insolvenzverwalter)_ as sole representative of the insolvency estate; b) unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the German Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings; d) claims against the German Guarantor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) with regard to an asset, i.e., where the relevant asset does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. Certain of these consequences may already impact the position of the holders of the notes prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings if so ordered by the competent insolvency court following the insolvency petition during preliminary proceedings. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any individual enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) already brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once formal insolvency proceedings have been opened (and may be subject to such stay already prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, certain secured creditors have preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) regarding the enforcement of their security interest. Depending on the legal nature of a security interest, German insolvency law bestows entitlement to enforce such security either with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte) or transfers of title by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well (ii) to collect any claims that have been assigned by way of security (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in aggregate, add up to nine percent of the gross enforcement proceeds, and less German value added tax (Umsatzsteuer) at a rate of currently 19 percent thereon (if applicable), are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The contributory charges will benefit the general insolvency estate. In the case of debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the cost of assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) cannot be deducted from the enforcement proceeds. Different rules might apply with regard to any security interest that constitutes financial collateral. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of an insolvency administrator that have taken place after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. After the liabilities of the estate, all unpreferred and unsecured claims (Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors unless they are subordinated as a matter of statutory law, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis from the free (net) insolvency estate of the debtor (Insolvenzmasse) that remains after assets have been disposed of and all prior-ranking liabilities have been settled and paid. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator to the creditors within formal insolvency proceedings and which, in order to become effective, requires, among others and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of a majority of creditor classes and, within each approving class, the majority of creditors belonging 418 ----- to such class (subject to specific majority rules and cram down rules). Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity-swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if that creditor does not consent to such debt-to-equity-swap. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, may then be required to compensate the creditor for the loss in value of such movable asset. If the German Guarantor grants security over its assets to other creditors than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the Notes under the Guarantees granted by the German Guarantor after such secured creditors have been satisfied. If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, it may also file for preliminary debtor-in-possession proceedings. In such a case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for a period of up to three months if an independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich _aussichtslos). During such period, the debtor shall, together with its creditors and a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter), prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be implemented in formal_ debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the relevant debtor company. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such debtor, the claims against such debtor would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen), meaning that dividends on such claim would only be made if all non-subordinated creditors’ claims have been fully satisfied. Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed, which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed by German law as, in most cases, the insolvency estate will not be sufficient to distribute any dividends on subordinated insolvency claims. Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. Recently, the German legislature adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz _zur Erleichterung der _Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which came into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides_ for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren)_ and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” _(Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan)._ Powers of attorney granted by the debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. In addition, most executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless the insolvency administrator opts for performance. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder _Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not_ 419 ----- to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Under these rules, an insolvency administrator (or in the event of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the trustee (Sachwalter)), may challenge acts (Rechtshandlungen) and transactions (Rechtsgeschäfte) that are deemed detrimental to the insolvency estate and have been effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings. Such challengeable transactions can include payments under any guarantee or the granting of security interests (including guarantees). In the event that a transaction is successfully challenged, the beneficiaries of such guarantee or security interest (such as the holders of Notes) would be under an obligation to repay the amount already received under the relevant security or guarantee, or to waive the guarantee. In particular, an act or a transaction detrimental to the insolvency estate may be challenged according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases: - any act (Rechtshandlung) or transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) granting a creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a debt can be avoided if such act was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due and the creditor had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed and the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity or of the filing of such petition (or, in the case of either (i) or (ii), the creditor had knowledge of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity); - any act (Rechtshandlung) or transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) granting a creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction can be avoided if such act was effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time thereafter; if such act was effected in the second and third month prior to the filing, it can be avoided if at the time of such act (i) the debtor was illiquid or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor (or had knowledge of circumstances imperatively suggesting such detrimental effects); - any transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor, or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable if it was entered into, can be avoided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid and the other party to the transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the transaction had knowledge of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; 420 ----- - any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor, including the granting of guarantees and security interests, during a period of ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, if the debtor acted with the intention to prejudice its creditors, can be avoided if the other party had knowledge of such intention at the time of such act, with such knowledge being presumed if the other party knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. In the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the avoidability of acts is limited to four years. In the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor was entitled in that form and that time, knowledge of such creditor of the intention of the debtor to prejudice its insolvency creditors shall (only) be presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was illiquid and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. The fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments shall establish the presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without adequate consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt) might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich); a gratuitous transaction can be avoided if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract (i) was concluded within two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or (ii) the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term “related party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory/advisory board, shareholders owning more than 25 percent of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically equivalent claim can be avoided (i) in the event it provided security, if the act was effected in the last ten years prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the event it resulted in satisfaction, if the act was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for commencement of opening proceedings or thereafter; or - a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party can be avoided if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., an entity subject to the German insolvency laws) was subject to illiquidity, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. Knowledge of pending restructuring proceedings (see￿Preventive Restructuring Framework) per se does not suffice for a creditor to be deemed to have such “knowledge.” A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to a “related party”, there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” If the Guarantee given by the German Guarantor were avoided or held unenforceable for any reason, a holder of the Notes would cease to have any claim or benefit in respect thereof. Any amounts received from a transaction that has been avoided would have to be repaid to the insolvent estate and a holder of the Notes would have a claim solely under the Notes, if any. The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be exempted—under certain circumstances—under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg) from avoidance rights. 421 ----- The Act on the Temporary Adaptation of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate Crisis Consequences (Sanierungs- und insolvenzrechtliches Krisenfolgenabmilderungsgesetz (“SanInsKG”), that has incorporated the former Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19_Insolvenzaussetzungsgesetz)), however, provides for privileged treatment of new financing and shareholder loans under German insolvency law claw-back provisions during a certain time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing was granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral to secure the repayment of shareholder loans or receivables resulting from legal transactions which are economically equivalent to a loan. Any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan approved by the relevant court (see— “Pre-Insolvency Restructuring Plan”) are not subject to avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the debtor is achieved, unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or incomplete information presented by the debtor and the addressee of the avoidance action had knowledge thereof. This privilege does not apply to shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral provided therefor. Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to avoid certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The prerequisites for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) differ to a certain extent from the rules described above under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Consequently, the granting of collateral such as Guarantees of the Notes by the German Guarantors is subject to certain limitations under the German Limited Liability Company Act (the Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”), including rules on capital maintenance. These provisions would also apply to any future German Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a limited liability company as general partner (Komplementär) (“GmbH & Co. KG”). As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets less liabilities and liability reserves)—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets—is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its stated share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees or security interests granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and to provide security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such “limitation language”, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or security interests contractually agree to enforce the guarantees and security interests against the German subsidiary only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital and thereby violating Sections 30 and 31. Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the Indenture and security documents, to the extent provided by a Guarantor incorporated in Germany in a corporate form as referred to above, contain or will contain a contractual limitation language. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee granted by such Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. German capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of the Guarantors constituted in the form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes or of the Guarantors to make payments on the related Notes Guarantee. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee granted by a German Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, potentially even to zero. _According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement_ may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital 424 ----- interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of guarantees by any of the Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the guarantee could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee and/or collateral was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest. The accessory security interests will also be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a creditor under the Notes. The holders on the other hand are creditors under the Notes. In order to allow the holders to benefit from the pledges, such pledges will also secure a so called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the holders’ claims under the Notes directly. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantee (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted. Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the holders with respect to the secured claims. However, the relevant grantor of security would still be able to do so (to the extent the relevant assets and claims are still existent and part of the (gross) insolvency estate). German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the security agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (Unternehmensstabilisierungs- und_restrukturierungsgesetz) (“Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors and/or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des _Restrukturierungsvorhabens). Restructuring Proceedings are applicable in cases in which a debtor faces imminent_ illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), i.e., that there is the imminent risk for the debtor of being unable to pay any of its debt as and when it falls due during the course of (regularly) the next 24 months. A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is likely that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over the next 24 months. The debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under “—Insolvency”). Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In 422 ----- addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can — under certain circumstances — even be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (see above under “—Insolvency”). The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates and/or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown). The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied. For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act by the Issuer, a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its center of main interest in Germany would be the following: - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review and/or supervision by a court; - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order; - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes. Restructuring plans which are made public and confirmed by a German restructuring court pursuant to the rules set out in the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act (applying as of July 17, 2022) will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings) upon such proceeding being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law. 423 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

This is particularly relevant to a Guarantor which is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (a “Dutch Guarantor”) and has its statutory seat (statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands, and which is therefore presumed (subject to proof to the contrary and exceptions under the Insolvency Regulation) to have its center of main interests in the Netherlands. See further “European Union” above. In the event it was determined by the court that a Dutch Guarantor has its centre of main interests outside of the EU, the Dutch Guarantor may still be subjected to insolvency proceedings in the Netherlands due to the fact that the Insolvency Regulation would not apply. In that event, the Dutch courts 425 ----- can claim jurisdiction based on the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) because the Dutch Guarantor has its statutory seat in the Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in the Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not incorporated under Dutch law. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are three primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. The third, the Dutch Scheme, which allows a debtor to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings such as suspension of payments or bankruptcy. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below. _Suspension of Payments_ An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non preferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The fact that the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non preferential creditors. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party the court can order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the moratorium, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments proceeding. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. _Bankruptcy_ Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all 426 ----- creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor incorporated under Dutch law will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver (curator) to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. An exception applies in the case of set off relating to a payment to the pledgor, not made during its bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee, although a set off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set off. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below “—Fraudulent Transfer.” Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. _Pre-insolvency plan_ As regards the pre-insolvency plan regime, debtors have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet 427 ----- _homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans”). The pre-_ insolvency plan regime has been incorporated in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act pursuant to this Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans. Unlike a moratorium and in bankruptcy, a composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of ipso facto, and supporting court measures. Such composition may result in claims against the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantor as compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favor of such a composition. A composition plan under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can affect the rights of noteholders. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross class cramdown). Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter _alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting_ class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a nonconsenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. During such period, inter _alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action_ to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In determining_ whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such transaction. In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may challenge the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above also applies with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment pursuant to a 428 ----- guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). Dutch law provides a special set of proceedings in relation to the settlement of disputes within a company. These special proceedings are known as inquiry proceedings (enquêteprocedures). Inquiry proceedings are used to address conflicts such as a director’s misconduct or internal conflicts between shareholders. Inquiry proceedings are held before the Enterprise Court at The Amsterdam Court of Appeal (Ondernemingskamer van _het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam). The Enterprise Court has extensive powers in resolving disputes and restoring_ balance within a company by way of injunctions or provisional injunctions, which can include suspension or avoidance of a guarantee in whole or in part.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

A secured creditor may, in principle, enforce its security as if there are no insolvency proceedings. This is subject to limited exceptions, including that (i) the court may impose a moratorium which may not exceed four months, during which pledgees may not exercise their rights, (ii) the liquidator in bankruptcy may fix a period within which the pledgee must exercise their rights. If the pledgee does not enforce its security rights during this period, the trustee in bankruptcy will become exclusively entitled to enforcement. However, even in such a situation, the pledgee will retain its priority in respect of the proceeds but will need to contribute pro rata to the general bankruptcy costs. The same applies in situations where there is a suspension of payment, and (iii) a court may suspend, for a period not exceeding eight months, enforcement of security rights against a pledgor in relation to which statutory proceedings for the restructuring of debts (akkoordprocedure) have been started. In general, under Dutch insolvency law mortgages and pledges rank above other rights of priority (other than senior ranking security and other liens), including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, Dutch law provides for exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a nonpossessory pledge on inventory (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere with these tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the debtor’s premises (bodemverhuurconstructie), have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme, now must inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been informed. Under Dutch law the following rules generally apply to the enforcement of a pledge. A pledge must be enforced in one of the following four ways, being (i) a public sale ('auction'), (ii) a private sale by the pledgee to a third party (a) either with the consent of the pledgor and any other interested party (such as the holder of a junior ranking pledge, or conservatory or executory attachment), or (b) with the approval of the competent court, (iii) accrual of the pledged asset to the pledgee ('appropriation') with the approval of the competent court for a price determined by that court, or (iv) in the event of rights of pledge on receivables, by collecting the receivables and having recourse against the amounts so collected. A public auction has to be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance with Dutch law and the relevant pledged company’s articles of association as they read at the time of foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge on claims can, in principle, only be enforced (through collection of the claims) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor. The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of Additional Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, and a pledge under any Dutch share pledge will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in 429 ----- Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch share pledge posed by Dutch law. To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch share pledge is successfully challenged, holders of Additional Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch share pledge. In addition, the holders of Additional Notes bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a transaction or a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver (curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the transaction or the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the transaction or the guarantee or security interest if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) such transaction was conducted at a time that the counterparty of knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty with a view to give preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. If a Dutch court found that the granting of a guarantee or security interest or any other transaction entered into by the Issuer or a Guarantor at any time in connection with the Notes involved a fraudulent transfer as set out above, then the granting of a guarantee or security interest or any other transaction entered into by the Issuer or a Guarantor could be nullified. In the case of successful challenge, holders of the Notes would not enjoy the benefit of such guarantee or security interest. It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor. If a security right is created on collateral to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will not be subject to such a security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title thereto. It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if created, in respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a Dutch private limited liability company which should be registered in its shareholders’ register.

Accordingly, transactions undertaken for the benefit of the Group may not always be considered consistent with the best interest of the company. In the context of upstream and cross-stream guarantees, the Spanish Supreme Court (Tribunal Supremo) has ruled that the subsidiary granting the guarantee or security interest to secure the debt of its parent company or other company of its Group should receive some kind of consideration or benefit, either directly or indirectly, to compensate the financial burden assumed in the interest of the Group. This compensation (i) must be verifiable, even if it is not received simultaneously to the granting of the guarantee or security; (ii) must be adequate and proportional to the burden assumed by the relevant company in the interest of its Group; and (iii) must have an economic value.

For example, as imposed by section 1 of article 363 of the Spanish Companies Law, when the enforcement of the guarantee causes the amount of the relevant Spanish subsidiary net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the balance between its net equity and its share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency.

In this case, there is a risk that a Spanish Court would consider a security given for the benefit of a security trustee as a number of concurrent, independent securities, each of them securing the rights of each of the individual beneficiaries of the trust. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish Court would recognize the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee’s actions in an enforcement situation. Under Spanish law there is some uncertainty (a) if the beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in the security agreement will be deemed to have a valid and perfected security 432 ----- interest under such security and (b) with respect to the validity of any security interest created in favor of the Security Agent under the Notes on behalf of the holders of the Notes. Therefore, there is a risk that the Security Agent would only be able to enforce against the debt it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it is acting as security agent. This limitation may be overcome if the Noteholders grant formal powers of attorney (duly notarized and, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961) in favor of the Security Agent in order for the latter to represent them in the enforcement proceedings. In the absence of the abovementioned power of attorney, the Security Agent may not be able to enforce the relevant Spanish security interest on behalf of all of the secured creditors (including the holders of the Notes). Further, those beneficial holders of the security who has not accepted the security or duly empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) the Security Agent to do so may be treated, from a Spanish law perspective including without limitation in an insolvency scenario, as unsecured creditors. Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has not been tested before the Spanish Courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not expressly contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and several creditor does not hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to represent the applicable Trustee and the holders of the Notes may be challenged. Further, it is worth noting that there is a risk that the relevant court or notary public before whom any Spanish security interest may eventually be enforced might request both the notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations arise, and the notarization of each and every one of the transfer certificates regarding each and every transfer of the Notes. Without notarization of the security documents, the secured parties will not have access to the executive summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain, having the secured parties to follow necessarily the ordinary judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

According to this special regime, as a general rule, their maturity can be extended up to 12 months since the issuance of the homologation ruling and up to 6 months since the issuance of the homologation ruling if a deferral or division in instalments (aplazamiento o fraccionamiento de pago) of such debt has been agreed with the public administration. The Plan must include a minimum content set out in article 633 of the Spanish Insolvency Law and will need to be formalized in a public document (formalizado en instrumento público). In addition, as opposed to the previous Spanish insolvency law, which only allowed a closed-ended list of measures to be imposed on dissenting creditors, a Plan under the Spanish Insolvency Law may contain almost any restructuring alternative, provided it is sufficient and proportionate to ensure the viability of the business and its continuation as a going concern. The debtor and its creditors may agree on any type of measure deemed necessary to effectively restructure the debtor’s business, including changes in the composition, conditions or structure –not only of the debtor’s liabilities, but also of its assets or any part of its capital structure. This could include sales of assets, parts of the business or even the entire business as a going concern, as well as any other necessary operational changes, or a combination of the same. The Plan must nevertheless set out the reasons why it has a “reasonable prospect of preventing the insolvency” of the debtor and ensuring the viability of its business in the short and medium term, including the necessary pre-conditions for its success. In addition, the mere judicial approval of a Plan does not affect bilateral contracts with outstanding reciprocal obligations at that time, they remain in force. Moreover, contracts that are deemed necessary to ensure the continuity of the debtor’s business cannot be terminated, suspended or amended due to a change in control of the debtor as a result of a debt-for-equity swap contemplated by the Plan. However, the Spanish Insolvency Law specifies certain exceptions to the principle of continuation of bilateral contracts that aim to ensure a Plan’s success, in particular, in relation to: (i) executory contracts (i.e., contracts with outstanding bilateral obligations); (ii) contracts with senior executives; (iii) financial collateral arrangements and/or netting arrangements; and (iv) trade supply agreements. On a separate note, class formation has been introduced by the amended Spanish Insolvency Law. Creditors affected by the Plan will be grouped into classes. The class formation criteria must be based on a common interest shared by each group of creditors. As a general rule, it is presumed that creditors with the same ranking in an insolvency process share a common interest, but they can also be separated into different classes if there are reasons justifying such split 436 ----- (e.g., financial and non-financial nature, conflicts of interests among creditors of different classes or measures to be imposed by the Plan). In any case, secured claims must constitute a single class, unless the different nature of the collateral justifies the creation of separate classes. Claims governed by public law will also constitute a separate class among the classes with the same ranking.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Therefore, the request for the joint insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves provided that they form part of the same Group. Any of the debtors, or the insolvency administrator, as the case may be, may apply for the procedural consolidation of insolvency proceedings already declared under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the debtors form part of the same Group of companies). In addition, creditors may apply for the procedural consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of two or more of its debtors already declared (acumulación de _concursos) if either (a) there is a confusion of assets among them, or (b) they form part of the same Group of_ companies, provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency administrator. Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated are processed in coordination, without consolidation of the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a general rule, a “group insolvency” does not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such Group. This means that the creditors of one company of the Group will not have recourse against other companies of the same Group (except where cross guarantees exist, in which case such a claim might be subordinated). The current system is basically a procedural one, aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost efficient as possible. However, exceptionally, and for the purpose of the drafting of the insolvency report, by the insolvency administrator only, assets and liabilities amongst the companies declared insolvent may be consolidated where there is a confusion of states and assets and liabilities belonging to each of the companies cannot be identified, in order to avert unjustified cost and delay. _Enforcement and termination in a pre-insolvency scenario_ The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees might not necessarily be enforced in accordance with their respective terms in every circumstance, such enforcement being subject to, inter alia, the nature of the remedies available in the Spanish Courts, the acceptance by such Court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the Courts, the power of such Courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law (Ley 1/2000, de _7 de enero de Enjuiciamiento Civil) (the “Spanish Civil Procedure Law”) regarding remedies and enforcement_ measures available under Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Law and other principles of law of general application. In this regard: - Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity nor the concept of punitive damages. In principle, the legal remedy which will be awarded under Spanish law is compensation for damages (indemnización de daños). Article 1,152 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties will substitute damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an event of breach, unless otherwise agreed. Spanish Courts may modify the penalty agreed on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, unless the penalty (liquidated damages) was aimed at such partial performance (and in any event if it is deemed to be disproportionate according to the good faith principle). There is doubt as to the enforceability in Spain of punitive damages. - Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of Spain. 437 ----- - Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish Courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties. - Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court (Tribunal Supremo), precludes an agreement being terminated on the basis of a breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings foreseen under the relevant agreement (such as payment obligations under financing agreements), and allows Spanish Courts not to enforce any such termination. - Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision whenever said acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed to have been executed in circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided shall apply. - Spanish Courts may award damages if the specific performance of an obligation is deemed impracticable. - Spanish Courts may modify the obligations deriving from contracts in the terms considered necessary in order to restore the balance between the obligations, if unexpected and exceptional circumstances arise that were unforeseeable when the contracts were executed, which would have been expressly or implicitly assumed.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management will be replaced (sustitución) by the insolvency trustee. However, the Court has the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the insolvency trustee’s request, the Court has the power to swap the intervention regime (regimen de intervención) for a suspension regime (regimen de suspensión) or vice versa. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required supervision of the insolvency authorities may be declared null and void. The time between the petition and the insolvency declaration by the Court will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the filing has been made by the debtor or the creditor (and in turn whether the debtor has challenged the petition made by the creditor), whether all appropriate documentation has been submitted on a timely basis or it is incomplete, and the workload of the Court. _Effects on Contracts_ Insolvency declaration does not affect contracts with reciprocal obligations pending performance by both parties by insolvency declaration (executory contracts), which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate. Early-termination, suspension or amending clauses triggered by the declaration of insolvency or the liquidation become void and unenforceable, unless there exists a legal provision permitting either termination of the contract in the event of insolvency (e.g., RDL 5/2005), or unilateral termination (e.g., swap agreements or agency agreements). The debtor or the insolvency trustee, with the Court’s approval, may request the termination of executory contracts in the interest of the insolvency estate (interés del concurso), including in the absence of contractual grounds for termination. A hearing with the parties will be held at which they will have the opportunity to reach an agreement on the termination and its effects. If an agreement is not reached, formal court proceedings will be held that will result in a decision issued by the Court. The indemnity granted to the contractual counterparty as a result of a contract being terminated early will be an insolvency claim (crédito concursal), and no longer a claim against the estate (crédito contra la masa). As a general rule, it is not possible to terminate an executory contract for breaches that occurred before the declaration of the insolvency proceedings. However, if a material breach of the executory contract occurred 438 ----- after the declaration of insolvency, the non-defaulting party may request the termination of the contract by filing a termination claim with the Court. As an exception to the above, termination due to pre-existing breaches may be admitted if the executory contract is a continuing-performance contract (tracto sucesivo). A continuing performance agreement does not require a one-off performance, but rather successive or continuous performance over an agreed period (for instance, leases or supply agreements). Some case law and legal scholars take nonetheless the position that termination of the contract should not be possible if one party already complied with its contractual obligations prior to the declaration of insolvency. When the default took place before the declaration of insolvency (when allowed), the claims of the nondefaulting party (including indemnity claims) will be an insolvency claim (crédito concursal). On the contrary, claims arising from defaults which took place after the declaration of insolvency will be claims against the estate (crédito contra la masa). Termination of the contract will also extinguish the outstanding contractual obligations. The Court may disregard the breach – regardless of whether it occurred before or after the declaration of insolvency –, and order specific performance of the contract for the remaining contractual term, if the continuation of the agreement is deemed to be beneficial for the outcome of the insolvency proceedings. The Court order may be appealed. If the default took place after the declaration of insolvency, the amounts owed to non-defaulting parties arising from the agreement must be paid from the debtor’s insolvency estate within three months after the Court order. If such payment is breach, the continuation of the contract will lose its effect. To ensure that the debtor’s insolvency estate has sufficient financial resources to continue the business, the Spanish Insolvency Law allows the insolvency administrator, either unilaterally or at the debtor’s request, to reinstate (rehabilitación) credit and other facility agreements to which the debtor was a party and which were accelerated by the creditor as a result of a payment default (principal or interest) in the three months preceding the declaration of insolvency. The exercise of this power by the insolvency administrator is subject to three conditions: - the insolvency administrator must provide notice of the reinstatement to the creditor before expiry of the term to lodge claims (that is, as a general rule, one month as from publication of the declaration of insolvency); - the insolvency administrator must satisfy or deposit any amounts unpaid at the time of reinstatement and “assume” future payments against the insolvency estate; and - the creditor must not have started any actions to claim payment before the insolvency proceedings commenced. A similar reinstatement rule exists in relation to deferred-payment purchase agreements that are terminated early within the three months preceding the declaration of insolvency. Additionally, insolvency declaration suspends interest accrual, except for claims secured with an in rem right, in which case ordinary interest accrues up to the value of the security, and except for any wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding State Budget Law (Ley de _Presupuestos del Estado)._ In any event, set-off is prohibited once the debtor has been declared insolvent unless (i) the requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the declaration of insolvency, even if such compensation is alleged afterwards, or the creditor communicated the existence of the claim to the insolvency administrator; (ii) the claim of the insolvent debtor is governed by a foreign law that permits set-off; or (iii) the claims and debts arise from the same legal relation. As a general rule, insolvency declaration stays, up to a year, enforcement proceedings tied to collateral necessary to pursue the ordinary course (excluding financial collateral, as defined in RDL 5/2005, which can be enforced at any time, and where the collateral is located outside of Spain). The enforcement of any security over certain assets that are necessary to the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the insolvent company (in rem securities) is prohibited until the earlier of (i) an arrangement of a composition agreement being reached, provided that the Composition Agreement does not affect such right; (ii) one year having elapsed as of the declaration of the insolvency without the opening of the liquidation phase; or (iii) the judge conducting the insolvency proceedings declaring that the asset is not necessary 439 ----- for the continuation of the debtor’s activities in accordance with the Spanish Insolvency Law. Commencement of the liquidation phase causes the loss of the right to commence a separate enforcement process in relation to those secured lenders who did not commence enforcement either before the declaration of insolvency or after a year since the declaration of insolvency. Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant security interest, that has been granted over such shares/quota shares, does not bring about an early termination or amendment of the contractual relations permitting the economic exploitation of the relevant asset. _Ranking of Credits_ The judge’s insolvency order contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to them within one-month period following the last official publication in the Official State Gazette (Boletín Oficial del _Estado) of the Court order declaring the insolvency (proof of claims), by providing original documentation that_ justifies their claims. Based on such documentation provided by the creditors and held by the debtor, the insolvency trustee draws up a list of acknowledged claims and classifies them according to the categories established under law, which are as follows: (i) claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa), (ii) claims benefiting from special privileges, (iii) claims benefiting from general privileges, (iv) ordinary claims, and (v) subordinated claims. ###### (a) Claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa) from article 242 of the Spanish Insolvency Law sets out the so-called “estate claims” which are pre-deductible claims from the estate (excluding those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security), are generally payable when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before other claims). Debt against the insolvency estate includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employees payroll; (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings; (iii) certain amounts deriving from executory contracts and obligations to return and indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor, those amounts that derive from the exercise of a claw-back action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it, if tied to bilateral contracts (except in cases of bad faith); (iv) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from tort liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion; (v) certain debts in the ordinary course of business incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency; (vi) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a Composition Agreement prior to the opening of the liquidation phase; and (vii) 50% of the new funds lent under a court-sanctioned Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, as long as the claims affected by the approved Plan amount to 51% of the total liabilities at least (or to more than 60% of the total liabilities, if the new financing is granted by persons being in a special relationship with the debtor, after deducting the claims of those persons). ###### (b) Claims benefiting from special privileges (créditos con privilegio especial), representing security on certain assets (essentially in rem security). Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided that such security is listed in the creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset determined in accordance with the rules provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Law minus senior claims). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the nature of the claim. Claims secured with pledges over future credit rights are only considered specially privileged if (i) the future credit rights arise from agreements or relationships established or executed prior to the declaration of insolvency; and (ii) (a) in the case of possessory pledges, the pledge was granted in a public document before the opening of the insolvency proceedings or, (b) in the case of non-possessory pledges (prenda sin desplazamiento), the pledge was registered with the applicable public registry before the opening of the insolvency proceedings. These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year from the declaration of the insolvency and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Law. However, within such waiting period or while any enforcement proceedings remain suspended under the Spanish Insolvency Law, the insolvency trustee has the option to pay the relevant claims against the insolvency estate under specific payment rules. Privileged creditors are not subject to Composition Agreement, 440 ----- unless they give their express support by voting in favor of the Composition Agreement or, in case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding security which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the Composition Agreement) of the total value of secured claims of the same class vote in favor of such Composition Agreement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the secured assets on which they are secured. ###### (c) Claims benefiting from general privileges (créditos con privilegio general) include, among others, certain labor debts and certain debts with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations corresponding to tax debts and social security obligations and debts held by the creditor applying for the corresponding insolvency proceedings, to the extent such application has been approved, are recognized as privileged for up to 50% of the amount of such debts (excluding the claims classified as subordinated). New funds under a court-sanctioned Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (crédito contra la masa) will also be credits with general privileges, as long as the claims affected by the approved Plan amount to 51% of the total liabilities at least (or to more than 60% of the total liabilities, if the new financing is granted by persons being in a special relationship with the debtor, after deducting the claims of those persons). The holders of general privileges are not to be affected by the Composition Agreement except if they give their express support by voting in favor of the Composition Agreement or, in the case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the Composition Agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of such Composition Agreement. If they do not agree to the arrangement and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment (in the order established by law). ###### (d) Ordinary claims (créditos ordinarios), consisting of non-subordinated and non-privileged claims, will be paid on a pro-rated basis from the proceeds of the assets not subject to secured claims, former prededuction of estate claims and generally privileged claims. ###### (e) Subordinated claims (créditos subordinados) are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts subordinated by virtue of law include, among others, some credits held by parties in special relationships with the debtor (personas especialmente relacionadas). In the case of individuals, this includes their relatives, legal entities controlled by the debtor or its relatives, the factual or legal administrators of such legal entities, any other legal entity forming part of the same Group of companies and the legal entities in respect of which the people described in this paragraph are their factual or legal administrators. In the case of a legal entity debtor, the following shall be deemed as “specially related parties”: (i) shareholders with unlimited liability (in case such shareholders are natural persons it would include any specially related party to these shareholders, as described herein), (ii) limited liability shareholders holding, when the claim arises, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company has securities listed on an official exchange market)—when the shareholder is an individual, those who would be specially related to the individual are also specially related to the debtor, (iii) directors (either de jure or de facto), liquidators and general directors holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent company (including those people that have held those positions during the two years prior to the insolvency declaration), and (iv) companies pertaining to the same Group as the debtor and (v) common shareholders to the insolvent debtor and to other company of the same group, provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant to a Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law or to a Composition Agreement shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such Plan or Composition Agreement. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors: they are not entitled to accede to the Composition Agreement and in the event of liquidation, they collect payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Law (once ordinary creditors have been paid in full). 441 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Therefore, there are no prior transactions that automatically become void as a result of initiation of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency trustee may only challenge those transactions that could be deemed as being “detrimental” to the insolvent debtor’s estate, provided that they have taken place within two years prior to the insolvency filing, even in the absence of fraudulent intent. The same rescission grounds apply in relation to any detrimental action carried out or agreement entered into by the debtor within two years preceding the pre-insolvency filing, as well as those carried out since that date up to the declaration of insolvency, even if there has been no fraudulent intent, as long as: (i) the Plan has not been passed or, when passed, has not been approved by the Court; and (ii) the insolvency is declared within a year from the end of the pre-insolvency period. “Detriment” does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interests or on the equality of treatment among creditors. The analysis of whether an action, agreement or transaction is detrimental to the insolvency estate must be made on a case-by-case basis. The Spanish Insolvency Law does not define “detrimental” but it establishes a series of presumptions that give some indication as to how a court would rule in specific cases. Pursuant to the law, (a) detriment exists (as a non-rebuttable presumption, without admission of proof to the contrary) in the case of (i) disposals without consideration, except for ordinary largesse (liberalidades de uso) and (ii) early payment of unsecured obligations maturing after the insolvency declaration (except secured claims); and (b) detriment is deemed to exist (as a rebuttable presumption) in the case of (i) transactions entered into with parties that have a special relationship with the debtor, (ii) the creation of in rem rights in order to secure pre-existing obligations or those incurred to replace existing obligations, and (iii) the cancellation of obligations secured by an in rem security falling due after the declaration of insolvency. In the remaining cases, detriment would have to be evidenced by the party seeking rescission. Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other group companies’ debt may be subject to claw-back, on the basis that such guarantees or security interests may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the Spanish Guarantor is not able to show that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the Spanish Guarantor to grant such guarantee or security (beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same Group of companies or the so-called “group interest”). Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee or security by the Spanish Guarantor is detrimental to the guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case-by-case basis (the beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Recent Spanish rulings which do not constitute settled case law indicate, and certain scholars, understand that risk associated with a guarantee or the value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee or secure indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group must be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Spanish company’s perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spanish case law recognizes the validity of upstream guarantees. If a claw-back action is successful, restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction, together with the proceeds and interest, will be ordered by the judge. If the assets cannot be restored to the debtor, the counterparty to the insolvent debtor must pay an amount in cash equal to the value of the assets at the time of their disposal, plus interest. If the judge rules that the transaction has been conducted in bad faith, the liable party will be obligated to indemnify the debtor for loss and damages suffered as its claim will be classified as subordinated. If the judge does not conclude that the transaction was conducted in bad faith, the counterparty to the debtor will settle its credit simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and rights to the insolvency estate as per bilateral contracts. The exercise of claw-back actions does not prevent other actions against the debtor in accordance with law, which may be brought before the insolvency judge. Under no circumstances can the following be rescinded: (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary course of the business, provided that they are carried out under market conditions, (ii) actions contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or liquidation of values and derivative instruments, (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of public law creditors or credits in favor of the labor authorities, and (iv) transactions subject to foreign law in case the beneficiary of the transaction can prove that such transaction cannot be rescinded under the law to which it is subject to. The amended Spanish Insolvency Law has also included among the transactions that cannot be subject to claw-back any transactions acknowledging and paying public law credits to mitigate the debtor’s liability pursuant to the applicable criminal laws. 442 ----- Neither Plans nor any transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any guarantees instituted in the performance of such Plans will be subject to claw-back actions, provided that they comply with the requirements set out below in section “Protection of Certain Plans Against Claw-back”.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action: - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after such debt was created; - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party; - such act was fraudulent; - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim. The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed (as opposed to claw-back actions where the subjective component or fraud does not have to be proven). Pursuant to article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a juris et de jure presumption (cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a juris tantum presumption (a rebuttable presumption). If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return the consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In order to seek protection against claw-back, Plans can be judicially sanctioned (homologado) by the Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil) that will be competent to conduct a potential insolvency proceeding, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such Plan. If the Plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the debtor’s total liabilities, the following will not be subject to claw-back unless it is proven that they were made with an intent to defraud creditors: ###### (a) actions and transactions that were “reasonable” and “immediately necessary” for the successful negotiation of the Plan, if expressly identified as such in the Plan. Any payment of (i) fees or costs in relation to negotiating, signing or confirming the Plan; (ii) fees for legal and professional advice with close relationship with the restructuring; (iii) employee salaries for completed work; and (iv) other amounts in the ordinary course of the debtor’s business activity, will be deemed to be protected actions and transactions; ###### (b) interim and new money: 443 ----- 1. Interim money: new financing granted to the debtor that is reasonable and immediately needed to (i) ensure that the debtor’s activity continues totally or partially while the Plan is being negotiated (and until a Court approves it); or (ii) maintain or increase the value of the debtor’s business or business units. 2. New money: new financing granted to the debtor that is provided for in the Plan and is necessary for its implementation. Interim and new money may benefit from two effects: ###### 1. Protection against claw-back under the same terms as any other actions or transactions resulting from the Plan. As a special rule, in order to protect interim or new money lent by a “specially related party” to the debtor from claw-back, the claims affected by the Plan (after deducting any claims held by specially related parties) must represent more than 60% of the debtor’s liabilities. Otherwise, they will be subject to the ordinary claw-back regime. ###### 2. Preferential treatment for repayment of interim or new money: in the event of the debtor’s insolvency, 50% of the interim or new money provided in the framework of a court-approved Plan will be treated as a claim against the estate (crédito contra la _masa). The remaining 50% will be treated as a generally privileged claim (crédito con privilegio general)._ This preferential treatment will only apply if the claims affected by the Plan exceed the minimum thresholds described above with respect to the debtor’s total liabilities (i.e., 51% in general, and 60% (after deducting any claims held by specially related parties) if interim or new money is granted by a “specially related party” to the debtor). ###### (c) actions and transactions that are reasonable and immediately necessary to implement the Plan. If the Plan affects claims that represent less than 51% of the debtor’s total liabilities, the actions and transactions described above may still be subject to claw-back, but none of the rebuttable presumptions of detriment explained in section “Hardening Periods” will apply. Therefore (as long as none of the non-rebuttable presumptions apply), the insolvency administrator or the creditor requesting the claw-back will need to evidence the detriment. Court approval of a Plan may be sought merely to ring-fence it from potential claw-back if the debtor becomes insolvent (i.e., without seeking to cram down dissenting creditors). The Court will verify that the relevant majorities required for court approval are met prior to approving the Plan. Judicially sanctioned Plans will not be subject to the insolvency claw-back action, but they may be challenged pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law. As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the Plan if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement. In any case, if the relevant threshold is satisfied, the plan will be deemed approved by the total amount of the creditors subject to the syndicated instrument. If the threshold is not satisfied, votes of consenting creditors will be taken into account on an individual basis, unless the syndicated claims constitute a single class of creditors (in which case it will be deemed that that class has not approved the Plan). In addition, dissenting creditors under a syndicated instrument can challenge the restructuring plan before the Courts. A Plan can be approved either by all classes of creditors (if certain majorities are reached within each class (consensual plans) or not by all classes of creditors (non-consensual plans or cross-class cram-down). For the latter to happen, the Plan must meet one of the following two requirements: (a) it must be supported by a simple majority of the classes, provided at least one of those classes is composed of claims that would benefit from a general or special privilege (i.e., secured claims) if the debtor were declared insolvent; or, failing that, (b) it must be supported by at least one of the classes that is “in the money” (i.e., any class that could, upon a valuation of the debtor as a going concern by the restructuring expert, be reasonably presumed to receive any payment according to the ranking of liquidation priorities applicable under the Spanish Insolvency Law). The Plan can only be imposed on the shareholders if the company is in a situation of imminent or current insolvency. 444 ----- Following the above, a dissenting creditor belonging to a dissenting class subject to a haircut will be allowed to challenge the Plan based on, among others, a more junior class (or the equity holders) receiving any payment from –or maintaining any interest in– the debtor under the Plan (i.e., the absolute-priority rule). The Spanish Insolvency Law, however, contains certain exceptions to the absolute-priority rule (it can be derogated in order to ensure the viability of the company and that the affected creditors’ claims would not be unjustifiably prejudiced). The effects of a cross-class cram-down are subject to some practical limitations. If the Plan affects a class of claims secured by rights in rem, and that class has rejected the Plan by a majority of dissenting votes over favorable votes, any secured dissenting creditor of that class will have the right to: ###### (a) enforce the underlying security interest (which will accelerate the underlying secured claim) within a month of the Court ruling approving the Plan being published in the Public Insolvency Register (Registro Público Concusal). If the proceeds obtained from the enforcement are (i) lower than the security value of the collateral set out in the Plan, the creditor will keep those proceeds in full (security value = 90% of “reasonable value” – legally preferred claims). Any deficit will remain unsatisfied; or (ii) higher than the security value collateral set out in the Plan, but lower than the original claim, the creditor will keep those proceeds in full. Any excess will be deducted from the amounts that the creditor’s unsecured part of the claim would be entitled to receive pursuant to the Plan; or ###### (b) only if expressly provided in the Plan, wait to receive a cash payment for the amount of the secured claim that is covered by the security value of the collateral within no more than 120 days. If payment is not received in a timely manner, the affected creditor will be entitled to enforce the security interest.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The debtor must file for liquidation after a creditors arrangement proposal has been approved when it becomes aware of its renovated insolvency situation or its inability to comply with the Plan. Liquidation triggers company dissolution and the insolvency administrator stepping into the directors’ shoes. Liquidation is moreover an acceleration and cash conversion event. Spanish Insolvency Law contains certain general rules of liquidation to be followed by the insolvency trustee, which can be modified or replaced by the judge on a case-by-case basis, subject to a hearing of or report from the trustee (to be issued within 10 calendar days) (special rules).The insolvency administrator is required to report quarterly on the liquidation and has one year to complete it. If the liquidation is not completed within one year, the Court may appoint a different insolvency administrator. _Termination of the insolvency proceedings_ Section 5º of article 465 of the Spanish Insolvency Law also foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at any stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid, or that all creditors have been entirely satisfied by other means. Finally, it must be noted that section 7º of article 465 and article 473 of the Spanish Insolvency Law foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at any time when assets are not enough to pay post insolvency debt, so long as no future claw-back actions are envisaged, nor actions claiming liability to third parties, nor the assessment of the proceeding as guilty.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Where a company conducts business in more than one Member State of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the relevant Courts may be limited if the company’s centre of main interest is found to be in a Member State other 445 ----- than its place of incorporation. The centre of main interest is presumed to be at the registered domicile of the company, but this presumption can be rebutted by a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the centre of main interest, which should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The point at which this issue will be determined is at the time when the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened (for these purposes, under Spanish law, if the place of incorporation of the debtor has changed during the six months prior to the insolvency declaration, such change shall not be taken into account). The determination of where the issuer or any of the guarantors has its “centre of main interests” would be a question of fact on which the courts of the different European Union Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. It should also be noted that a limited number of final decisions have been taken in cases that have been brought before the European Court of Justice in relation to questions of interpretation or the effects of the Insolvency Regulation throughout the European Union. Furthermore, “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. In the event Spanish Courts have jurisdiction, article 261 of the current Spanish Insolvency Law may apply, in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by a Spanish Guarantor may be classified as “contingent” claims and no amount may be recognized until and when a default occurs and the guarantee is validly enforced. Nor will they have voting rights.

Spanish Civil Code does not expressly regulate the possibility of creating second or subsequent ranking pledges with delivery of possession. However, Law 41/2007, of December 7, which modifies Law 2/1981, of March 25, on Regulation of the Mortgage Market and other regulations of the mortgage and financial system, regulation of reverse mortgages and insurance of dependence and by which a certain tax rule is established (Ley _41/2007, de 7 de diciembre, por la que se modifica la Ley 2/1981, de 25 de marzo, de Regulación del Mercado Hipotecario y otras normas del sistema hipotecario y financiero, de regulación de las hipotecas inversas y el seguro de dependencia y por la que se establece determinada norma tributaria) recognises, with respect to the_ creation of pledges without delivery of possession and with the creation of chattel mortgages, the possibility of creating pledges without delivery of possession and chattel mortgages with a concurrent and/or second or subsequent rank with regards to an already existing first ranking pledge without delivery of possession or to a first ranking chattel mortgage. As a consequence of the above, there are also grounds to sustain the validity of second ranking pledges, even though a different view from the competent Courts cannot be disregarded. Separately, Spanish Civil Code does not expressly regulate the possibility of creating a single global pledge to secure several obligations. However, this is contemplated in RDL 5/2005 and in some resolutions from the Directorate-General of Registers and Notaries (Dirección General de los Registros y del _Notariado), which allows the creation of single financial security to secure several obligations and global real estate mortgages, regulated by article 153 bis of Spanish mortgage law dated 8 February 1946 (Decreto de 8 de febrero de 1946, _por el que se aprueba la nueva redacción oficial de la Ley Hipotecaria), which also allows to secure several_ obligations in a single mortgage. As a consequence of the above, there are also grounds to sustain the validity of global pledges, even though a different view from the competent Courts cannot be disregarded. Given the above any security governed by Spanish common law (Derecho Común) may be created to secure various obligations (either one security per obligation or as a global security) but to the extent it is not expressly foreseen neither tested by the Spanish Courts, a Court ruling may come to the conclusion any such security to be void and null. 446 ----- Likewise Spanish law is based, inter alia, on the principle of ancillary nature (principio de accesoriedad), by virtue of which a security interest, in general terms, under Spanish law, any pledge must secure another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant security agreement. Therefore, the guarantee or security interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee or security interest and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee or security interest. In the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish Courts may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not enforceable. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations. According to Spanish law, the law governing in rem legal aspects of a pledge is the law applicable in the place of location of the pledged asset (lex rei sitae). When the pledged asset is a credit right—such as receivables or intercompany loans—the determination of the lex rei sitae is unclear given its lack of physical existence. In these cases, several theories have been construed amongst Spanish scholars so as to determine the lex rei sitae (such as domicile of debtor of the credit rights being pledged, domicile of pledgor, law governing the credit right being pledged, etc.). If a Judge considered that any of the pledges created over credit rights under the Spanish security documents is governed by the Law 5/2006, of May 10, of the Fifth Book on the Catalonian Civil Code, on in rem rights (Ley 5/2006, de 10 de mayo, del libro quinto del Código Civil de Cataluña, relativo a los derechos _reales), then this regulation would govern those pledges instead of the Spanish civil common law, which could_ determine the challenge of the validity of such pledges. A Spanish Court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish Courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The amendments to the Spanish Insolvency Law came into force, subject to certain exceptions, on 26 September 2022. The Spanish Insolvency Law regulates insolvency court-supervised proceedings, as opposed to out-ofcourt liquidation (which, pursuant to Spanish Companies Law, is only available when the debtor has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities or in specific situations regulated under the Spanish Insolvency Law). The Spanish full-blown insolvency proceeding (insolvencia), which is referred to as “concurso de acreedores”, applies to all persons or entities (save for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the Spanish Insolvency Law). These proceedings may lead either to reorganization through the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor (convenio) (the “Composition Agreement”) or to the liquidation of the debtor’s assets (liquidación). _Insolvency Filing_ A debtor (in the case of a company, its directors) is required to file the insolvency petition upon inability to regularly pay its liabilities as they become due (insolvencia actual). As a general rule, a debtor has to file for voluntary insolvency within two months from the date on which it knew, or should have known, that it was in an insolvency situation. The debtor is also entitled (but not required) to apply for such insolvency proceedings when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they become due (insolvencia inminente). According to the amendments to the Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is in an imminent insolvency scenario when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they will become due in the next three months. Creditors do also have standing to petition mandatory insolvency (concurso necesario) when the debtor is unable to regularly pay its debts as they come due (i.e., only in an actual insolvency scenario). Insolvency is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. If the debtor requests the insolvency, it must prove its current or imminent insolvency. The debtor must file a petition for insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of actual insolvency (inability to regularly pay the debts as they come due). It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proven, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Where the debtor fails to file a petition for insolvency within the time period established by law (two months), (i) the directors may be removed from office and substituted by an insolvency authority once the insolvency is declared and the insolvency process is initiated; (ii) the debtor may be unable to exercise certain courses of action; and (iii) the directors may be held liable for the impaired claims accrued as from the consent of insolvency (responsabilidad concursal), should the debtor be liquidated and insolvency be classified as “guilty” (concurso culpable). Insolvency is considered mandatory (concurso necesario) if filed by a third party and upheld by the Court. Under section 4 of article 2 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration of insolvency if it can prove that the debtor has failed to attach or seize any assets, or sufficient assets, to pay the amount owed. A creditor may also apply for a debtor’s insolvency if it can prove to the Court (i) a generalized default on payments by the debtor, (ii) a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets, (iii) a misplacement, “fire sale”, hasty, loss-making or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets or (iv) a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (i.e., three months). The general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two months does not apply if, by means of the communication that is foreseen under article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the so-called 5 _bis communication by reference to a previous regulation –Law 22/2003–), the debtor who is in actual, imminent or likely insolvency, and has not been declared in insolvency, notifies the Court that it has started negotiations with its creditors to seek support for a “restructuring plan” (the “Plan”), in which case it will have an additional grace period of three months and one more to file for insolvency. Such grace period of three months could be extended 434 ----- if, not later than at the end of the initial three-month grace period, either the debtor, or creditors holding more than 50% of the debts that the Plan may affect at that time (net of any credits that would qualify as subordinated (acreedor subordinado) claims in an insolvency situation), may request the Court for a three-month extension, provided the restructuring expert, if one is appointed, issues a favorable report in support of the request. The new law introduces the concept of “likelihood of insolvency” (probabilidad de insolvencia), which is when it is objectively foreseeable that the debtor will be unable to regularly fulfil its obligations that fall due in the next two years unless it enters into a Plan with its creditors. In addition to being able to start negotiating with its creditors with a view to entering into a Plan at any time during this period when insolvency is likely, the debtor will also be able to file for pre-insolvency in court, in which case it will inform the applicable Court that it is trying to negotiate a Plan with its creditors. _Pre-Insolvency filing_ Spanish law contains a restructuring moratorium proceeding, which is an insolvency proceeding under both Spanish and European regulations. It protects the debtor, for a four-months period (or up to seven months, if extended), from petitions for mandatory insolvency proceedings. As mentioned above, the general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two-months period does not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable Court that it has initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain support for a Plan, as set out in articles 614 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law. Effectively, by means of the communication that is foreseen under article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the so-called 5 _bis communication by reference to a previous regulation –Law 22/2003–), on the top of those two months, the debtor gains an additional three-months period (or up to six months, if extended) as from the date when the debtor gives such notice, to achieve a Plan with its creditors and one further month to file for insolvency, if the above mentioned period of three months (or of six months if extended) has elapsed without an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists. Additionally, during the three-month protection period provided by the pre-insolvency filing (or six months in case it has been extended under the new insolvency regime), enforcement actions are stayed, subject to the following: - As a general rule, neither judicial nor extrajudicial enforcement proceedings may be initiated to seize or attach assets or rights that the debtor requires (the so-called “necessary assets”) to continue its professional or business activities. Previously initiated enforcement proceedings will be stayed. It is not always easy to determine when an asset is necessary to operate the business and the courts decide on a case-by-case basis. They normally take a flexible approach and consider elements such as cash or credit rights as assets that are necessary to continue to run the business. However, creditors may challenge the court clerk’s asset qualification, which the Court will hear. - At the debtor’s request, the Court may extend these stays in relation to one or several creditors or class of creditors in respect of other assets or rights, even if they are not deemed “necessary assets”, if doing so could help bring the negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion, provided the restructuring expert, if one has been appointed, has given its consent. The Court decision on this suspension may be challenged by a remedy (recurso de reposición), exclusively. - Subject to the above, enforcing security in rem over “necessary assets” may be initiated but will be automatically stayed. However, neither financial collateral governed by Royal Decree-Law 5/2005, March 11, on urgent reforms for the encouragement of productivity and the improvement of government procurement (Real Decreto-Ley 5/2005, de 11 de marzo, de reformas urgentes para el impulso de la _productividad y para la mejora de la contratación pública) (the “RDL 5/2005”), nor in rem security_ interests over assets located in another Member State (other than Denmark) should be affected by this suspension. In relation to the above provisions, Spanish Courts may apply them, under certain circumstances, in relation to assets held by non-Spanish affiliates of the entity that files for pre-insolvency, with effects outside of Spain. In any case, the above regime does not apply to public credit rights (créditos de derecho público). In such case, enforcement can be suspended in very limited circumstances and, in any case, up to a maximum period of three months. 435 ----- Also, while the effects of pre-insolvency are in force, according to the amended Spanish Insolvency Law, directors’ legal duty to wind up the company in the event of a capital impairment situation (i.e., its net equity is below a half of its share capital) is suspended. In case of essential contracts for the viability of the business, the relevant counterparties will not be entitled to suspend, amend or early terminate such contract for contractual breaches occurred prior to the communication that is foreseen under article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the so-called 5 _bis communication by reference to a previous regulation –Law 22/2003–) while the effects of such communication are in force (even if the relevant contracts allowed it). Filing for pre-insolvency has also the following effects: - _Over credit rights. Pre-insolvency does not cause itself the early maturity of claims. Contractual provisions amending or declaring the early maturity of claims in case of pre-insolvency shall become ineffective. - _Over contracts. Any contractual provisions declaring the early termination, suspension or amendment of a contract with outstanding reciprocal obligations in case of pre-insolvency or analogous proceedings shall be rendered ineffective. This will not be applicable for contractual netting agreements (acuerdos de _compensación contractual) subject to RDL 5/2005._",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security. Until floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge. On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallised at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of insolvency office-holders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency office-holders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”) in a member state of the EU, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, in addition be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign insolvency processes may be recognized by the English court in respect of the insolvency proceedings of any English 447 ----- company that has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings may depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings”). English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantees and secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the payment obligations of the Issuer in respect of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer and of a Guarantee against an English Obligor and of the security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights for payment of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer and/or under the Guarantee and/or under the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Obligor.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, such an order may be applied for by the company itself, a majority of its directors, one or more of its creditors (including contingent or prospective creditors) or certain other designated persons. In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. Under section 123 of the Insolvency Act, the circumstances in which a company is deemed “unable to pay its debts” include, among others, the following: (a) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a statutory demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has failed for three weeks to pay, secure or compound the sum to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor; (b) failure to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order); (c) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (d) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on _insolvency”)._ An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (see “—Qualifying floating charge” below), and different procedures apply according to the identity of the person making the appointment. During the administration, in general, no resolution may be passed, and no order may be made, for the winding up of the debtor and no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the debtor, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with permission of the court or the consent of the administrator. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “—Prescribed Part”). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the administration moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations. It is likely, to the extent that it is not a financial collateral arrangement, that the security granted by an English company may not be enforced while it is in administration. 449 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into administration. A floating charge constitutes a qualifying floating charge if it is created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company, or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security granted to that party, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company, and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge.

The ability to appoint an administrative receiver only applies to holders of a qualifying floating charge where either the security document granting such charge pre-dates 15 September 2003 or where it falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002). The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the English company under the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge (see “—Transactions at an undervalue”, “—Preference” and “—Voidable floating charge,” respectively).

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such and a fixed charge receivership can be run in parallel to a liquidation or an administration. However, an administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration”). The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor, although certain limited duties are also owed to the chargor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a 450 ----- collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Prescribed Part”).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

An English Obligor may be able to propose a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign Obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also propose a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme. In exercising its discretion to sanction a scheme of a foreign Obligor, the court will need to be satisfied that the scheme of arrangement would have substantial effect in the jurisdictions in which the company has its main assets or operations, in the jurisdictions of any other obligors of the debt and under the governing law the affected debt documents (if not English law). This is typically achieved by providing expert evidence that the scheme of arrangement (or its effect) is likely to be recognized in such jurisdictions. Once sanctioned, the scheme of arrangement binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the scheme of arrangement, which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement to the Registrar of Companies.

While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties. A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of 451 ----- classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed compromise. There is no requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting, and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of the plan, provided that the court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ and (b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes of this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors do not vote in favour of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes. Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory conditions have been met and may also consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan. In the case of a non-UK company that is not required to register particulars with the Registrar of Companies (namely those without a UK physical presence, like an establishment, branch or place of business, where it carries on business), a restructuring plan will become effective when a copy of the order has been published in the Gazette. For all other companies, including an English company, a restructuring plan will become effective upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies.

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation, either in the form of (I) members’ voluntary liquidation or (ii) creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. A members’ voluntary liquidation is a solvent liquidation that is initiated by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court. Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after making full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts in full (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act – see “—Administration”), including interest and the costs of the members’ voluntary liquidation process, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation. A creditors’ voluntary liquidation is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to an members’ voluntary liquidation, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). The directors must seek a decision of the creditors to nominate a liquidator. If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail, unless the court determines otherwise. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction 452 ----- (see “—Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts”), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary windingup – it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. Regardless of how (s)he is appointed, a liquidator has a general duty to act in good faith and to exercise their powers with reasonable skill and care for their proper purpose, and to act impartially to avoid conflicts of interest. A liquidator’s powers include to: (i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or defend any legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring actions to set aside certain transactions (see “—Avoidance of transactions”). There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security and/or guarantees, or the entry by an English company into a transaction can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the English company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the relevant act. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by the company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a security interest or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid. _Onset of insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges (all discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (a) the court application for an administration order is issued or (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration. _Connected persons_ If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below). A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges is a party who is (i) a director of the company, (ii) a shadow director, (iii) an associate of such director or shadow director, or (iv) an associate of the relevant company. 453 ----- A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual, or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is able to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest or guarantee granted by the English Obligor include, without limitation, the following. _Transaction at an undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if onset of the company’s insolvency occurs within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as set out above), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the English company in such proceedings. A transaction is “at an undervalue” if the transaction is a gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company. A court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside payments, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believed that the creation of such payment, security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts at the relevant time or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the company’s 454 ----- insolvency occurs within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential position in relation to that person when taking their decision. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position in which case the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no in fact such desire, on the part of the company, to prefer them. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. _Transaction defrauding creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue (i.e. that the transaction is a gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company) and the court is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against the company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction including the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and use of the provision is therefore not limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no statutory time limit within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of or as a result of the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the Notes or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not they are the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate credit transaction_ An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of 455 ----- fair dealing. It is presumed, unless otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with respect to which an administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside an extortionate credit transaction in extortionate. The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years before the day on which a company entered administration or liquidation. That order may set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction, The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g. assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it). _Voidable floating charges_ Under English insolvency law, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year prior to the onset of the company’s insolvency (or two years in case of a floating charge in favour of a connected person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts (or became unable to do so as a result of) granting the floating charge, will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of (i) the money paid to, or (ii) the goods or services supplied to, or (iii) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for a company to be insolvent at the time of granting the floating charge or to become insolvent as a consequence of doing so does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration, whether the relevant company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. One of the primary functions of administration and liquidation under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent company and to distribute realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the “Prescribed Part” (see “—Prescribed part”), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Insolvency set-off applies automatically as a matter of statute and cannot be contracted out of. It arises where, prior to specified points in the company’s liquidation or administration, there have been “mutual dealings” between the company and a creditor. The application of insolvency set-off requires that account be taken of the sums due to the company from the creditor and vice versa in the course of those mutual dealings to be set off, so that only the balance may be claimed by the liquidator or administrator or proved for by the creditor. In the case of liquidation, insolvency set-off applies from the date the liquidation commences. In the case of administration, 456 ----- insolvency set-off applies if, and from the point that, the administrator gives notice that they propose to make a distribution to creditors. The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): _First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured_ assets covers that indebtedness). _Second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the_ order of priority in which expenses are paid). _Third ranking claims: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._ - Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date. As between one another, preferential debts rank equally. - Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax, employee NI contributions, student loan repayments and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally. _Fourth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security._ This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors (see “—Prescribed part”). _Fifth ranking claims:_ - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (which, for these purposes, would include a creditor’s unsecured claim to any shortfall in its secured claim) (not repaid in full from the realization of assets subject to its security), in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay a shortfall, the officeholder can only use realization from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part in respect of a shortfall unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security. - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid. _Sixth ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining_ funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. 457 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its entry into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when this shift arises, the English courts have held that it takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable.” Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law. _Security registration_ Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest (the “Registration Period”). While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the Registration Period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the Registration Period has expired. The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets. _Moratoriums_ As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “— _Administration”), moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “—Liquidation/winding- up”), and a standalone moratorium for companies in financial distress._ The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 includes a new standalone moratorium for companies in financial distress into a new Part A1 of Insolvency Act. The directors of a company with a sufficient connection to England and Wales to be eligible for compulsory liquidation (as described above) may apply for the moratorium without first invoking a formal insolvency proceeding if they are of the view that the company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts, subject to certain exceptions and other eligibility criteria. A moratorium will initially last for 20 business days (extendable without court or creditor consent by a further 20 business days and by up to a year in total with creditor consent), giving a debtor breathing space from creditor action to enable it to pursue restructuring options. During the moratorium the company is protected from the following forms of creditor action: (a) the enforcement of security (except where security constitutes a “security financial collateral arrangement”); (b) the 459 ----- crystallisation of any floating charges or imposition of any restrictions on the disposal of an asset subject to a floating charge; and (c) the commencement of insolvency processes (e.g. administration or liquidation) in respect of the company. As well as the protections from creditor action outlined above, the company is relieved from paying any debts that have fallen due prior to the commencement of the moratorium or that fall due during the moratorium but were incurred prior to the moratorium, subject to a number of exclusions. One such notable exclusion from the payment holiday applies to contractual debts or liabilities relating to financial services contracts, which generally includes loan facilities and capital markets transactions. While secured creditors are prevented from enforcing their security (unless it qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement”), they are entitled to call a default, accelerate their debt or demand repayment of amounts owed and terminate contracts during the moratorium. If payments cannot be made as and when they fall due, in respect of such debts to which the payment holiday does not apply, an independent monitor (appointed by the court to oversee the moratorium) will be required to bring the moratorium to an end, likely triggering the entry into a formal insolvency process (e.g. liquidation or administration). _Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_ Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant office-holder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act)[.]",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law, among other things, facilitates the recognition in an implementing jurisdiction of insolvency proceedings instituted in another jurisdiction as either foreign main proceedings (if the insolvency proceedings are in the place of the COMI of the relevant debtor) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the insolvency proceedings are not in the place of the debtor’s COMI but the debtor has an establishment there) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement and restructuring plans will be a question for the domestic law of any recognising state and private international law and treaties - for example, Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”) (for recognition within the EU only) or any treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments (such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as 448 ----- fixed security interests rather than recharacterised as floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law (e.g., schemes of arrangement or restructuring plans), Rome I may offer a basis for recognition in EU member states. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

There is also a fifth less common regime pursuant to a scheme of arrangement. Each of these are statutory processes under the Australian Corporations Act. A brief description of each of these processes is set out below. _Administration_ According to s 435A of the Australian Corporations Act, the object of administration is to provide for the business, property and affairs of a company that is, or is likely to become, insolvent at some future time to be administered in a way that maximizes the chances of the company, or as much as possible of its business, continuing in existence, or if it is not possible for the company or its business to continue in existence, is to result in a better return for the company’s creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding up of the company. During the administration period there is a general moratorium on the enforcement of creditors’ claims (subject to certain exceptions) and also a stay on legal proceedings which will prevent, amongst other things, security being enforced (subject to certain exceptions). The administration period therefore enables the administrator to continue to trade the company’s business, and for any proposal to rehabilitate the company or otherwise maximize returns to creditors (other than via an immediate winding up) to be put before creditors, and, if approved, implemented via a deed of company arrangement. The most common method for appointment of an administrator is for the company’s board to resolve that in the opinion of the directors voting for the resolution, the company is insolvent, or is likely to become 461 ----- insolvent at some future time and that an administrator should be appointed. A creditor with a charge over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the company’s property can also appoint an administrator, as can a liquidator or provisional liquidator (if the company is already in liquidation or provisional liquidation). The Australian Corporations Act provides that the aim of the voluntary administration regime is to maximize the chances of the company surviving, or if not possible, to maximize the return available to creditors. In this sense, and particularly the first limb of the aim, it is not dissimilar to the focus on corporate rehabilitation as part of the U.S. Chapter 11 process, but there are some key differences, including that: - the company’s directors are relieved of their powers during the administration period (subject to the administrator’s written approval to them exercising a function or power as a director) and the administration is conducted by an independent insolvency practitioner who must be a registered liquidator; - a voluntary administration can take place entirely without court involvement (although it is common for court applications to be made in relation to the conduct of the administration and the liability of the administrator); - contractual counterparties are generally at liberty to terminate their contracts with the company if they have a contractual right to do so arising from the appointment of the administrator (though see comments below regarding the statutory stay on enforcing ‘ipso facto’ rights in this regard); and - a secured creditor with a security interest over the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the company which, where relevant, has been perfected under the Personal Property Securities Act 2009_ (Cth), is entitled to enforce that security interest within 13 business days after the appointment of the administrator is notified to them (or such longer time as the court may order or the administrator may agree in writing). Administration is generally intended to last for a short period of time; however, in practice, the period is typically extended by court order. For complex matters (including those with cross border elements), extensions of up to, and at times more that, 12 months are not uncommon. During the administration period, the administrator controls the company and acts as its agent, while the powers of the directors and officers of the company are suspended. The administrator has very broad powers including the power to trade on the company and sell its assets. Importantly, an administrator is a fiduciary and officer of the company, and as such is subject to the duties applicable to company officers. The administrator is personally liable for debts of the company incurred during the administration period for services rendered, goods bought, property leased or occupied and funds borrowed. The administrator has a statutory right to be indemnified out of the company’s property for these and other liabilities (s 443D of the Australian Corporations Act), which indemnity is secured by a statutory lien on the company’s property (s 443F(1) of the Australian Corporations Act) and takes priority over all other unsecured debts (s443E(1)(a) of the Australian Corporations Act) This regime is intended to encourage suppliers, employees and customers to continue to trade with the company during the administration period. To permit the administrator the opportunity to do this, during the administration period there is a moratorium on the enforcement of creditors’ claims and actions against the company and its property (subject to certain exceptions) and also a stay on legal proceedings which will prevent, amongst other things, security being enforced (subject to certain exceptions) in each case without the consent of the administrator or order of the court. In addition, guarantees granted by the directors of the company (or their spouses and relatives) cannot be enforced during the administration period except with leave of the Court. There are two meetings of creditors required to be held during an administration. The most important of these is the second creditors’ meeting, which must be convened within 20 business days of the administrator’s appointment or such longer period as the court orders (on application by the company). Prior to the second creditors’ meeting, the administrator must provide creditors with a report about the company’s business, property, affairs and financial circumstances, sets out the details of any proposed deed of company arrangement, and provides the administrator’s opinion as to whether it is in the interests of the creditors to either: (a) execute the proposed deed of company arrangement; (b) end the administration and return the company to the control of its directors; or (c) wind up the company. The administration period and associated statutory moratoriums end when the creditors resolve in favour of one of these options at the second creditors’ meeting or in the case (a), once the deed of company arrangement is executed by the company and the deed administrator (which execution must occur within 15 business days after 462 ----- the end of the second creditors’ meeting or such further period as the court allows on an application made during those 15 days). _Deed of Company Arrangement_ A deed of company arrangement (“DOCA”) is a statutory contract between the company and its creditors (and sometimes others) that governs the relations between those parties after the end of an administration. The Australian Corporations Act is relatively flexible on the contents of the DOCA, however there are certain minimum requirements, including the nature and duration of any moratorium period, property available to pay creditors, the order of payments to creditors, the release of the debts of the company and termination provisions. Once the DOCA is executed, the administration ends and the statutory moratorium restrictions come to an end and are replaced by the provisions of the DOCA, which may include similar moratorium protections. A DOCA is administered by a deed administrator (usually the same insolvency practitioner who acted as voluntary administrator) who is generally tasked by the deed with realizing assets, closing down the business, restructuring the company or pursuing litigation with a view to the payment of dividends to creditors. A resolution at the second creditors’ meeting to execute a DOCA must be passed by a simple majority vote (in number, unless a poll is conducted in which case it is by number and value of debts and claims). A DOCA once executed will bind all unsecured creditors whose debts are provable, the company itself, directors and members. Secured creditors who did not vote in favour of the DOCA will not generally be bound by the deed (including any moratorium provisions contained in it). A DOCA can (if so expressed) have the effect of extinguishing the debt of a secured creditor that did not vote in favour of the resolution to execute the DOCA pursuant to s 444D(1) of the Australian Corporations Act. However, this extinguishment is subject to the preservation of the secured creditor’s ability (by virtue of s 444D(2) of the Act) to realize or deal with its security interest in respect of the secured property and to the extent that its debt was provable and secured assets were available at the date that debt would otherwise be released under the DOCA, without requiring that that debt be preserved into the future or for other purposes. A DOCA can be terminated in accordance with its terms, by an order of an Australian court, or in certain circumstances by resolution of the company’s creditors. _Liquidation_ A liquidation (also known as a winding up) is the process by which the liquidator takes control of the company from its directors, and undertakes the tasks of realizing all of the company’s assets, the calling up of partly paid shares and the distribution of the proceeds among the company’s creditors and (if there is a surplus after paying creditors) a distribution of the surplus to members. The distribution of proceeds will be subject to statutory priority rules. Following a liquidation, the company will be deregistered and will cease to exist as a corporate identity. For an insolvent company, a liquidation can take the form of either a court ordered or “compulsory” liquidation, or a creditors’ “voluntary” liquidation (including following a voluntary administration or a DOCA). Creditors of the company and certain other eligible applicants can apply to the court to have a company wound up on a range of bases, including insolvency. The members of a company may also elect to wind up a company solvently. A liquidator has extensive powers, including the power to compel the production of books of the company, and to investigate the company’s affairs by way of public examinations of officers or persons otherwise involved in the affairs of the company. Importantly, liquidators can also recover property by avoiding certain pre-liquidation transactions. Generally, liquidators will not trade on a company that is being wound up, as the winding up procedure is terminal. During a liquidation, the powers of directors are suspended, a transfer of shares in a company is void (unless done with the liquidator or court’s consent) and there is a stay of any proceedings against the company and a prohibition on enforcement (by unsecured creditors) except with the leave of the court. Liquidation of itself will not alter the obligations of counterparties under contracts, unless the liquidator performs, repudiates or disclaims the contract. In a winding up, all unsecured creditors with debts or claims (including contingent, future and unliquidated claims) against the company are entitled to participate for dividends from the available assets in 463 ----- respect of their debt or claim. Claims are submitted to and adjudicated by the liquidator in a quasi judicial capacity pursuant to the proof of debt procedures in the Australian Corporations Act and regulations. Specific debts and claims will take priority over the claims of unsecured creditors, including the expenses incurred by an administrator/liquidator, the costs of obtaining any order for liquidation, and employee entitlements. All other unsecured debts rank equally according to the pari passu principle. If the property of the company is insufficient to meet the outstanding debts and claims in full, they must be paid proportionately. On liquidation, unsecured creditors have no rights to specific items of the company’s assets; as noted however they have a right to lodge a proof of debt and an entitlement to their pro rata entitlement to a fund of assets protected and properly administered. Secured creditors are not impacted by the liquidation to the extent they are entitled to enforce their security interest during the liquidation (subject to the rights of any prior security holders and any applicable intercreditor arrangements), assuming it is not void as against the liquidator. Secured creditors who are otherwise able under their respective security agreements have the right to appoint a receiver and manager and enforce against the property secured in their favour during the liquidation. _Receivership_ A receiver is typically appointed by a secured creditor pursuant to a security agreement providing for that secured creditor’s security interest, after the company has defaulted under the security agreement and in accordance with its terms. The receiver may also act as a manager of the company, and as such may sideline the other officers of the company (including the directors or an administrator or liquidator). Receivership is a regime implemented for the benefit of the secured creditor that appoints the receiver. This is in contrast to the administration, DOCA and liquidation regimes, which are primarily aimed at securing the best outcome for all of the company’s creditors as a whole. The receiver has no direct role in relation to the unsecured creditors of the company, and it is possible to have a receivership in place concurrently with an administration or liquidation. There is no moratorium or stay on the enforcement of claims against a company in receivership, as there is in administration and liquidation. Where a company grants security over an asset, the proceeds of enforcement must generally be remitted to the secured party (subject to priority creditors and any applicable intercreditor arrangements). One exception to this is that where assets are subject to a security interest over circulating assets, the receiver must pay or provide for priority payments from their proceeds before accounting to the secured party. Priority payments are those listed in s 433(3) of the Australian Corporations Act and include liabilities in respect of certain insurance policies, auditors’ fees and employees’ wages and superannuation and certain other employee entitlements, and the amount owing to the administrator on account of his or her fees, costs and expenses. In a liquidation scenario, unpaid employee entitlements can be met by the Australian Commonwealth Government in certain circumstances, which is then subrogated to those employees' rights in the liquidation. _Creditors’ Scheme of Arrangement_ A scheme of arrangement is an arrangement or compromise which binds the company and its creditors or members. In brief, there are two different types of schemes: members’ schemes and creditors’ schemes. Before either type of scheme can be implemented it must be approved by the Court, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the members or creditors of the company respectively. Creditors’ schemes of arrangement are becoming more widely used in an insolvency context. A creditors’ scheme needs to be approved by voting creditors constituting 75% in value and 50% in number and each separate class of creditors (if any) needs to approve the resolution. A creditors’ scheme will often involve a proposal to defer, compromise or extinguish the company’s debts. A typical scenario would involve a moratorium in respect of claims against the company and a compromise of debts owed by it (and/or a modification of the rights of creditors or a class of them in relation to the company). Once the requisite approvals have been obtained, the scheme will be binding on all creditors (including dissenting creditors). Unlike a DOCA, schemes of arrangement can bind secured creditors, owners and lessors in respect of their property and can release third party claims provided there is sufficient nexus between the release and the debtor’s obligations. 464 ----- Schemes are, however, extremely flexible and can be utilized to implement any arrangement relating to the rights and obligations of the company and its creditors, save that a scheme which is contrary to law, or not in the public interest, is unlikely to be approved by the Court (even if it has the support of creditors).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.17,Australia,1339.17.2,Voidable transactions,"Liquidators have the power to investigate the affairs of the company and to take appropriate legal action against directors or third parties to recover certain assets or undo certain transactions for the purpose of increasing the estate available for distribution to unsecured creditors. The Guarantee granted by Lima Australia might be subject to review under Australian laws relating to voidable transactions (s 588FE of the Australian Corporations Act). Also, any loans to Lima Australia may be subject to review under Australian laws relating to voidable transactions as an unfair loan (s 588FD of the Australian Corporations Act). The voidable transaction powers are only available to a liquidator of Lima Australia. If the entry into the Guarantee constitutes a voidable transaction under Part 5.7B of the Australian Corporations Act, noteholders could be required to disgorge payments made by Lima Australia in an insolvency proceeding. If, on the application of a company’s liquidator, a court is satisfied that a transaction of the company is a voidable transaction, it may make a variety of orders which are set out in section 588FF of the Australian Corporations Act. These orders include an order releasing or discharging, wholly or partly, a debt incurred, or a security or guarantee given, by the company under or in connection with the transaction, or an order requiring a party to repay to the company some or all of the money it received under the transaction. _Unfair Preferences_ An unfair preference is a transaction between a company and a creditor which results in the creditor receiving from the company, in respect of an unsecured debt, more than it would receive if the transaction were set aside and the creditor were to prove for the debt in a winding up of the company (s 588FA(1) of the Australian Corporations Act). An unfair preference is an insolvent transaction if the company either: (i) is insolvent when the transaction is entered into or when an act is done (or an omission is made) for the purpose of giving effect to the transaction; or (ii) becomes insolvent because of, or because of matters including, entering into the transaction or because of a person doing an act (or making an omission) for the purpose of giving effect to the transaction (s 588FC of the Australian Corporations Act). An unfair preference that is an insolvent transaction is voidable if it was entered into (or an act was done for the purpose of giving effect to it): (i) during the six months ending on the relation-back day (as explained below); (ii) after the relation-back day but on or before the day when the winding up began (s 588FE(2) of the Corporations Act); or (iii) if a related entity of the company was a party to the transaction, during the four years ending on the relation-back day (s 588FE(4) of the Australian Corporations Act). Section 91 of the Australian Corporations Act defines “relation-back day” and describes 15 circumstances in each of which the “relation-back day” is separately identified. The relation-back day differs depending on variables such as whether: - the liquidation is court-ordered or voluntary; - the company was under administration or subject to a deed of company arrangement when the winding up order was made or the resolution to wind up was passed; - the deed of company arrangement specifies circumstances in which the deed is to terminate and those circumstances have occurred; - the application to wind up or notice of the resolution to wind up occurred before or after the beginning of the administration; - in the case of a voluntary winding up, an application for a court ordered winding up has been made and if so, whether the application was made before or after the administration commenced; and - the company’s creditors have passed a resolution terminating a deed of company arrangement. - In respect of each particular circumstance, section 91 (when read in conjunction with ss 513A, 513B and 513C) of the Australian Corporations Act specifies a relation-back day which is one of the following: 465 ----- - the date on which an application for winding up is filed with the Court; - the date on which the administration began; - the date on which the Court orders the winding up; or - the date on which the special resolution to wind up the company was passed. _Uncommercial Transactions_ A transaction is an uncommercial transaction under s 588FB(1) of the Australian Corporations Act if it may be expected that a reasonable person in the company’s circumstances would not have entered into the transaction, having regard to: (i) the benefits (if any) to the company of entering into the transaction; (ii) the detriment to the company of entering into the transaction; (iii) the respective benefits to other parties to the transaction of entering into it; and (iv) any other relevant matter. “Transaction” is broadly defined and generally includes the provision of a guarantee. A guarantee would not constitute an uncommercial transaction if the benefit to the company providing the guarantee in the context of the transaction outweighs the detriment that could be incurred by the company in providing the guarantee. An uncommercial transaction that is an insolvent transaction (as that term is explained above) is voidable if it was entered into (or an act was done for the purpose of giving effect to it) during: (i) the two years ending on the relation-back day (s 588FE(3) of the Australian Corporations Act); or (ii) if a related entity of the company was a party to the transaction, the four years ending on the relation-back day (s 588FE(4) of the Australian Corporations Act). The “relation-back day” has the same meaning as described above under the unfair preferences section. _Unfair Loan_ A loan may be challenged on the basis it is an unfair loan under s 588FD of the Australian Corporations Act if interest or other charges in relation to the loan are considered to be extortionate when the loan was made, or has since become extortionate because of a variation. In determining whether interest or charges were or became extortionate, regard is given to a number of factors (with reference to the applicable time) including the risk to which the lender was exposed, the value of the security in respect of the loan, the term of the loan, the repayment schedule, the amount of the loan and any other relevant matter. _Circulating security interests_ Further, upon liquidation, a circulating security interest, being a security interest that attaches to circulating assets (as to which, see above), that was granted within six months of the commencement of the liquidation, is void against the liquidator, except so far as the security secures, among other things, (A) advances of new money to the grantor company, (B) a liability under a guarantee or other obligation undertaken at or after the time of the grant of security on behalf of or for the benefit of the grantor company, or (C) an amount payable for new property or services provided to the company. This arises under s 588FJ of the Australian Corporations Act. Section 588FJ does not apply where the grantor company was solvent immediately after the grant of the security. Where a liquidator successfully challenges a transaction such as a guarantee and avoids that transaction, then this can prevent the enforcement of the security interest and any money paid or received under that transaction can become the subject of a court order for repayment. _Unreasonable director-related transactions_ Transactions between a company on the one hand, and a director or his or her close associate on the other, are treated as voidable on a winding up of the company if they occur in circumstances where a reasonable person in the company's circumstances would not have entered into the transaction: s 588FDA. This section applies in respect of: payments made by the company; a conveyance, transfer or other disposition by the company of its property; the issue of securities by the company; or its incurring an obligation to make such a payment, disposition or issue: s 588FDA(1)(a) of the Australian Corporations Act. Whether a reasonable person in the company's circumstances would not have entered into the transaction is determined having regard to: any benefits to the company of entering into it; the detriment to the company of entering into it; the respective benefits to other parties to the transaction of entering into it; and any other relevant matter: s 588FDA(1)(c). The test whether such a transaction is unreasonable is objective in character and the matters specified in s 588FDA(1)(c) must be taken 466 ----- into account in determining that matter, and a transaction may be unreasonable although its proponent is both sole director and shareholder of a company. _Creditor-defeating dispositions_ A transaction which is a “creditor defeating disposition” within the scope of s 588FDB of the Australian Corporations Act may be voidable on a winding up of a company. A disposition of property of a company is a creditor defeating disposition within s 588FDB(1) if (1) the consideration payable to the company for the disposition was less than the lesser of (i) the market value of the property or (ii) the best price that was reasonably obtainable for the property, having regard to the circumstances existing at that time the relevant agreement (as defined in s 9) for the disposition was made or, if there was no such agreement, at the time of the disposition; and (2) the disposition has the effect of preventing the property from becoming available for the benefit of the company’s creditors in the winding up of the company; or hindering, or significantly delaying, the process of making the property available for the benefit of the company’s creditors in the winding up of the company. Section 588FDB(2) extends the concept of a creditor defeating disposition to the position where a company does something that results in another person becoming the owner of property that did not previously exist; and, under s 588FDB(3), if (1) a company makes a disposition of property to another person and the other person gives some or all of the consideration for the disposition to a person other than the company (“third party), then the company is taken to have made a disposition of the property constituting so much of the consideration as was given to the third party. Broadly, a creditor-defeating disposition is voidable under s 588FE(6B) if made by a company at the time when it is insolvent or, because of the disposition, the company immediately becomes insolvent or (in certain circumstances) enters external administration within the 12 months after the transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The Automatic Stay operates during the following stay periods: (a) in the case of a scheme designed to avoid the company being wound up in insolvency, during a period that starts when the company publicly announces that it will or otherwise does in fact, apply to hold a scheme meeting under s 411 of the Australian Corporations Act, and ends: (i) if the company fails to make the announced application – at the end of 3 months after the announcement, or such longer period as is ordered by a court; 467 ----- (ii) when the application is withdrawn or rejected by the court; or (iii) when the scheme ends, unless this occurs because the company is to be wound up, in which case when the company’s affairs have been fully wound up. (b) in the case of a receivership or managing controllership, during a period that starts when the receiver or managing controller is appointed and ends when the receiver’s or managing controller’s control ends or such later time as is ordered by the court; (c) in the case of an administration, during a period that starts when the company comes under administration and ends the latest of: (i) when the administration ends; (ii) if an application is made before the administration ends to extend the period of the stay – when the court so orders; or (iii) if the administration ends because of a resolution or order for the company to be wound up – when the company’s affairs have been fully wound up. (d) in the case of a company under restructuring under Part 5.3B of the Australian Corporations Act, during the period when the restructuring of the company begins and ending at the later of: (i) when the restructuring ends; (ii) if an application is made before the restructuring ends to extend the period of the stay – when the court so orders; (iii) if the restructuring ends because of a resolution or order for the company to be wound up – when the company’s affairs have been fully wound up. In addition, and notwithstanding the abovementioned stay periods, the Australian Corporations Act also makes provision for rights to remain unenforceable indefinitely against the company (i.e. beyond the expiry of the relevant stay period), where the reason for seeking to enforce the right is: (a) the company’s financial position before the end of the stay period; (b) the fact that the company experienced before the end of the stay period any of the abovementioned circumstances which could or did trigger the Automatic Stay in the first place; or (c) a prescribed reason relating to the circumstances in existence during the stay period. These particular provisions (namely ss 415D(4), 434J(4), 451E(4) and 454N(4) of the Australian of Corporations Act) are very significant, as they effectively make the Automatic Stay permanent. That being said, companies should be aware that: (a) The Automatic Stay does not apply to rights arising under all contracts. The stay will not apply to: (i) rights arising under contracts entered into after the court approves the scheme, the receiver or managing controller is appointed or the company comes under administration or restructuring (as relevant); (ii) other types of contracts or contractual rights prescribed in the regulations or by ministerial declaration; or (iii) rights where the scheme administrator, receiver or managing controller, administrator or restructuring practitioner (as relevant) has consented in writing to the enforcement of the right. 468 ----- (b) Courts will have the power to lift the Automatic Stay in respect of certain ipso facto rights if satisfied that doing so is in the interests of justice or (in the case of a scheme only) the relevant scheme is not for the purpose of the company avoiding being wound up; and (c) Contractual counterparties cannot be required to provide the company with additional credit or money during a period where one or more of the counterparty’s own rights cannot be enforced against the company by reason of the Automatic Stay. As noted above and notwithstanding the comment above regarding the Automatic Stay “effectively” being made permanent, this concomitant stay on the company’s ability to demand additional credit does not extend beyond the expiry of the relevant and abovementioned stay periods. _Stay Orders in respect of potentially broader range of contractual rights_ The Australian Corporations Act also provides that courts will be able to make orders that for a period of time specified in the order, one or more rights under a contract may only be enforced with the leave of the Court or on terms imposed by the court (“Stay Orders”), if the court is satisfied that the relevant right: (a) is being exercised; (b) might be exercised; or (c) there is a threat that it might be exercised, merely because the company has experienced any of the circumstances which could or did trigger an Automatic Stay. It is also possible for a court to make interim orders before deciding an application for a Stay Order. While it is clear that Stay Orders may not be granted in respect of rights specifically carved out from the operation of the Automatic Stay (see discussion above), as there are no other limitations on the types of contractual rights which may be the subject of Stay Orders, these Stay Orders will be able to be made in respect of a potentially broader range of contractual rights than the Automatic Stay. In this regard, 415F(1),434L(4), 451G(1) and 454Q(1) of the Australian Corporations Act notes that a Stay Order could be sought for example, in respect of a right to terminate for convenience. The Ipso Facto provisions commenced on 1 July 2018. The Automatic Stay does not interfere with the right of a substantially secured creditor to appoint a receiver during its 13 business day decision period following the appointment of administrators (discussed above).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

On a liquidation of a New Zealand company, certain categories of preferential debts and the claims of secured creditors would be paid in priority to the claims of unsecured creditors and certain secured creditors. Such preferential debts would comprise of, among other things, costs associated with liquidation, employee claims (up to a statutory cap), payments related to Kiwisaver (the New Zealand employee saver scheme), certain claims of the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department, claims of lien holders in relation to debts for the provisions of services to the company before the liquidation, claims of certain buyers of goods under the Fair Trading Act 1986, and the costs incurred in organizing and conducting a meeting of creditors for the purpose of voting on a proposed compromise. Accordingly, if Lima New Zealand becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding and the relevant company has obligations to creditors that are preferred under New Zealand law, the noteholders may suffer losses as a result of not having preferred status during such insolvency proceedings. In particular, where the assets of the company are insufficient to meet the claims of the preferential creditors, the New Zealand Companies Act 1993 (“New Zealand Companies Act”) provides that the claims of certain preferential creditors are to be paid out of any accounts receivable or inventory of the company in priority to a secured creditor with a security interest in those same accounts receivable or inventory, unless the security meets certain safe harbor criteria. Preferred creditors will have priority over a secured creditor to the extent that the secured creditor’s security interest: - is over all or any part of the company’s accounts receivable and inventory or all or any part of either of them; - is not a purchase money security interest that has been perfected at the time specified in the New Zealand Personal Property Securities Act 1999 (“New Zealand PPSA”); and - is not a security interest that has been perfected under the New Zealand PPSA at the commencement of the liquidation and that arises from the transfer of an account receivable for which new value is provided by the transferee for the acquisition of that account receivable (whether or not the transfer of the account receivable secures payment or performance of an obligation). _Section 293—voidable charges_ Under New Zealand insolvency law a liquidator of Lima New Zealand could apply to the Court to have certain transactions entered into by any of the companies before the commencement of liquidation set aside. Section 293 of the New Zealand Companies Act provides that a charge given by a company is voidable by a liquidator if: - the charge was given: i. any time up to six months before the commencement of liquidation of that company (the “Specified Period”); and ii. immediately after the charge was given, the company was unable to pay its due debts; or - the charge was given to a related party: i. any time up to two years before the commencement of liquidation of that company (the “Related Party Specified Period”); and ii. immediately after the charge was given, the company was unable to pay its due debts. 470 ----- However, a charge meeting these requirements will not be voidable to the extent that it secures money actually advanced or paid, or the actual price or value of property sold or supplied to the company, or any other valuable consideration given by the charge holder (acting in good faith) at or after the time the charge was granted (section 293(1A)(a)). _Section 292—insolvent transactions_ Under sections 292(1) and 292(1A) of the New Zealand Companies Act, a transaction by a company is voidable by the liquidator if it is an “insolvent transaction” entered into in the Specified Period or entered into with a related party of the company within the Related Party Specified Period. The definition of “transaction” for this purpose includes the creation of a charge over the company’s property, and that term will include the grant of a guarantee (as may be granted by Lima New Zealand). Section 292(2) provides that an insolvent transaction is a transaction by a company that: - is entered into at a time when the company is unable to pay its due debts; and - enables another person to receive more towards satisfaction of a debt owed by the company than the person would receive, or would be likely to receive, in the company’s liquidation. _Sections 296 and 296A—voidable dispositions_ A disposition of a company’s property is voidable if it is made during the period beginning on the date on which an application is made to appoint a liquidator and ending at the time the liquidator is appointed (or the court otherwise disposes of the application). A court is not able to order the recovery of property of a company (or its equivalent value) by a liquidator, if the person from whom recovery is sought proves that when it received the property, it: - acted in good faith; - a reasonable person in its position would not have suspected, and it did not have reasonable grounds to suspect, that the company was, or would become, insolvent; and - it gave value for the property or altered its position in the reasonably held belief that the transfer of property to it was valid and would not be set aside. _Section 297—transactions at an undervalue_ Section 297(2) of the New Zealand Companies Act provides that in the liquidation of a company, the liquidator may recover from any other party to a transaction any amount by which the value of the consideration or benefit provided by the company exceeded the value of the consideration or benefit received by the company where: - the transaction was entered into by the company any time up to two years before the commencement of liquidation of that company; and - either: (i) the company was unable to pay its due debts when it entered into the transaction; or (ii) the company became unable to pay its due debts as a result of entering into the transaction. For the purposes of section 297, “transaction” has the same meaning as in section 292, and accordingly the definition would capture both the guarantee and the grant of security which Lima New Zealand may grant. 471 ----- _Sections 292 and 293—ability to pay due debts_ The voidability of a charge under each of sections 292 and 293 depends in part on the failure of the company to satisfy a cashflow solvency test (whether the company in question is unable to pay its due debts). Balance sheet solvency is not relevant. Under both sections 292 and 293 of the Act, a company is presumed to be unable to pay its due debts if the relevant transaction was effected within six months of liquidation. In such circumstances, the burden of proof is on the relevant creditor to prove otherwise. _Section 348 of the Property Law Act 2007_ A transaction that was made with intent to prejudice a creditor, or by way of gift, or without receiving reasonable equivalent value in exchange may be subject to a vesting order or a compensatory order under section 348 of the Property Law Act 2007.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The New Zealand Companies Act provides that the company, a liquidator, an interim liquidator (if applicable), a secured creditor holding a charge over the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property, or the Court may appoint an administrator. The object of the voluntary administration regime is to provide for the business, property and affairs of insolvent companies, or companies that may become insolvent, to be administered in a way that maximizes the chances of the company continuing in business (or, if that is not possible, to get a better return for the company’s creditors and shareholders than would result from immediate liquidation). The regime is intended to be employed before liquidation becomes unavoidable. A moratorium is imposed on creditors from the commencement of the voluntary administration. This gives the administrator a period (during which creditors cannot commence or continue proceedings against the company, or enforce security against its assets) to investigate the affairs of the company and put a plan in place. However, secured creditors with a security interest in substantially the whole of a company’s property can avoid this moratorium if they enforce their security (including by the appointment of receivers if the terms of their security permits it) within the first ten working days of a company being placed into administration. If, for any reason, an administrator was appointed to Lima New Zealand while any amounts due by the Issuer under the Notes were unpaid, the primary risk to the noteholders is that they would only be able to exercise enforcement rights against Lima New Zealand (whether by appointing a receiver to the entity or otherwise) during the moratorium if the exercise of those enforcement rights was commenced within ten working days of the company being placed into administration. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event of Lima New Zealand becoming insolvent, a guarantee or any payment under it will not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would uphold such guarantee.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Receivership is a regime implemented for the benefit of the secured creditor that appoints the receiver. The receiver owes its primary duty to the secured creditor that appoints it. This is in contrast to both the administration and liquidation regimes, which are aimed at securing the best outcome for all of the company’s creditors as a whole and its members.

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees of any Guarantor incorporated in New Zealand must be in the best interests of the New Zealand company (or its holding company if its constitution so provides). The question of best interests must be determined on a case by case basis. If directors cause the company to give guarantees which are not in the best interests of the company or its holding company (where permitted under its constitution), they can be sued for breach of duties and serious breaches are an offence, but generally the guarantees and supporting security cannot be set aside unless on the application of a prejudiced shareholder the court considers in the circumstances that it is just and equitable to do so. Directors also owe other duties to companies of which they are the directors. These include the duty to exercise their power as a director for a proper purpose, the requirement to not agree to the company incurring an obligation unless the director believes at that time on reasonable grounds that the company will be able to perform the obligation when required to do so, the requirement not to agree to, cause or allow the business of the company to be carried on in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company’s creditors, and the requirement to exercise care, diligence and skill that a reasonable director would exercise in the same circumstances. 469 ----- In the event of an insolvency of the Lima New Zealand, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in New Zealand and New Zealand insolvency law would govern those proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Interest will be included in the relevant beneficial owner’s Italian income tax return and will be subject to Italian ordinary income taxation and the imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a deduction from Italian income tax due. Where a Noteholder is an Italian-resident company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-resident company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes are deposited with an authorized intermediary, Interest from the Notes will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva. Interest must, however, be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and is therefore subject to general Italian corporate income taxation and, in certain circumstances, depending on the status of the Noteholder and also to the Italian regional tax on productive activities (“IRAP”).

Subject to certain conditions and requirements (including minimum holding period requirement) and several limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment), interest relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth under Italian tax law. _Application of the imposta sostitutiva_ Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the imposta sostitutiva is applied by banks, brokerage companies (società di intermediazione mobiliare, or “SIM”), fiduciary companies,_ _società di gestione del risparmio_ (“SGR”), stockbrokers and other entities identified by decrees of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (each, an “Intermediary”). An Intermediary must: (a) be resident in Italy or be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-resident financial intermediary; and (b) participate, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change in the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited. If the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by the relevant Italian financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial intermediary) paying the Interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of non-resident corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct imposta sostitutiva suffered from income taxes due. _Non-Italian resident Noteholders_ If the Noteholder is a non-resident for tax purposes, an exemption from the imposta sostitutiva applies, provided that the non-resident Noteholder is: (1) a beneficial owner of the payment of Interest and resident, for tax purposes, in a state or territory included in the White List; or 481 ----- (2) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; or (3) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a state or territory included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own state of establishment; or (4) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign state. In order to ensure gross payment, non-resident Noteholders must promptly deposit the Notes together with the coupons relating to such Notes directly or indirectly with: (a) an Italian or non-resident bank or financial institution (there is no requirement for the bank or financial institution to be EU resident) (the “First Level Bank”), acting as intermediary in the deposit of the Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Noteholder with a Second Level Bank (as defined below); or (b) an Italian resident bank or SIM, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-resident bank or SIM, acting as depositary or sub-depositary of the Notes appointed to maintain direct relationships, via telematic link, with the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (the “Second Level Bank”). Organizations and companies that are not resident of Italy, acting through a system of centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Department of Revenue of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (which include Euroclear and Clearstream) are treated as Second Level Banks, provided that they appoint an Italian representative (an Italian resident bank or SIM, or the permanent establishment in Italy of a non-resident bank or SIM, or a central depositary of financial instruments pursuant to Article 80 of Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998) for the purposes of the application of Decree No. 239. If a non-resident Noteholder deposits the Notes directly with a Second Level Bank, the latter shall be treated both as a First Level Bank and a Second Level Bank. The exemption from the _imposta sostitutiva_ for non-resident Noteholders is conditional upon: (i) the deposit of the Notes, either directly or indirectly, with an institution which qualifies as a Second Level Bank; and (ii) the submission to the First Level Bank or the Second Level Bank (as the case may be) of a statement of the relevant Noteholder (autocertificazione), to be provided only once, in which it declares, inter alia, that it is the beneficial owner of any interest on the Notes and it is eligible to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva. Such statement must comply with the requirements set forth by a Ministerial Decree dated December 12, 2001, is valid until withdrawn or revoked (unless some information provided therein has changed) and does not need to be submitted where a certificate, declaration or other similar document for the same or equivalent purposes was previously submitted to the same depository. The above statement is not required for non-Italian resident investors that are international bodies or entities set up in accordance with international agreements entered into force in Italy referred to in point b) above or Central Banks or entities also authorized to manage the official reserves of a State referred to in point d) above. Additional requirements are provided for “institutional investors” referred to in point c) above (in this respect see Circular No. 23/E of March 1, 2002 and No. 20/E of March 27, 2003). The imposta sostitutiva will be applicable at a rate of 26% to interest paid to Noteholders who do not qualify for the foregoing exemption or do not timely and properly satisfy the requested conditions (including the procedures set forth under Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules). Noteholders who are subject to the imposta sostitutiva might, nevertheless, be eligible for full or partial relief under an applicable tax treaty, subject to timely filing of required documentation provided by Regulation of the Director of Italian Revenue Agency No. 2013/84404 of July 10, 2013.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Noteholders may set off any capital losses with their capital gains. In respect of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, taxpayers may opt—under certain conditions— for any of the three regimes described below. _Tax return regime._ Under the tax return regime (regime della dichiarazione), which is the default regime for Italian resident individuals not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the CGT on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains (net of any incurred capital loss) realized by the Italian resident individual holding the Notes during any given tax year. Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity must indicate the overall capital gains realized in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss, in their annual tax return, and pay the CGT on such gains, together with any balance of income tax due for such year. Within the same time limit, capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four succeeding tax years. _Nondiscretionary investment portfolio regime (Risparmio Amministrato Regime)._ As an alternative to the tax return regime, Italian-resident individual Noteholders holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity may elect to pay the CGT separately on capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (regime del risparmio amministrato). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to: (1) the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial intermediaries; and (2) an express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in a timely fashion by the relevant Noteholder. The depository must account for the CGT in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss. The depository must also pay the CGT to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any possible capital loss resulting from a sale or redemption or certain other transfer of the Notes may be deducted from capital gains subsequently realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years, up until the fourth tax year. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains/losses realized within said regime in the annual tax return. _Discretionary investment portfolio regime (Risparmio gestito regime)._ In the _risparmio gestito regime, any capital gains realized by Italian-resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity and who have entrusted the management of their financial assets (including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary, will be included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized, at tax year-end, subject to a 26% substitute tax, to be paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Any decrease in value of the managed assets accrued at the tax year-end may be carried forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. The Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains or losses realized within said regime in its annual tax return. Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from the 26% CGT) if the Noteholder is an Italian resident individual not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30,1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10, 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements set forth under Italian tax law. _Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_ Any gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes will be treated as part of taxable business income (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of net value of 483 ----- the production for IRAP purposes), if realized by an Italian company, a similar commercial entity (including the Italian permanent establishment of non-resident entities to which the Notes are connected) or Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected. _Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian real estate investment fund or an Italian real estate SICAF will be subject neither to CGT nor to any income tax at the level of the real estate investment fund or the Real Estate SICAF (see “Tax treatment of Interest—Real estate investment funds and real _estate SICAFs”). However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income_ realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares. Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment funds or real estate SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax transparency basis. Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which is a Fund, a SICAF (other than a real estate SICAF) or a SICAV will not be subject to CGT but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant fiscal year. Such result will not be taxed at the level of the Fund, the SICAF or the SICAV, but income realized by the unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or sale of the units/shares may be subject to a withholding tax of 26%. _Pension funds_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to 20% substitute tax. Subject to certain conditions and requirements (including minimum holding period requirement) and several limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment), income relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxble base of the substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth under Italian tax law. _Non-Italian resident Noteholders_ A 26% CGT on capital gains may be payable on capital gains realized on the sale or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy. However, under Article 23(1)(f)(2) of Decree No. 917, capital gains realized by non-resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and traded on regulated markets in Italy or abroad are not subject to the CGT, subject to the filing of required documentation in a timely fashion (in particular, a self-declaration that the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes). Capital gains realized by non-resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer, even if the Notes are not traded on regulated markets, are not subject to the CGT, provided that the beneficial owner is: (a) a resident, for tax purposes, of a state or territory included in the White List; or (b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; or (c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a state or territory included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own state of establishment; or (d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign state. In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must satisfy the same conditions set forth above to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva in accordance with Decree 239 (see “— _Tax Treatment of Interest”)._ 484 ----- If none of the above conditions is met, capital gains realized by non-resident Noteholders from the sale or the redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets may be subject to the CGT at the current rate of 26%. However, Noteholders might benefit from an applicable tax treaty with Italy, providing that capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the State where the recipient is tax resident, subject to certain conditions to be satisfied. Under these circumstances, if non-resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to the risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-residents Noteholders file in time with the authorized financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from the competent tax authorities of their country of residence. The _risparmio amministrato_ regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-Italian resident persons and entities holding Notes deposited with an Intermediary, but non-Italian resident Noteholders retain the right to waive this regime.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below). This discussion does not address the impact of the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities (or investors in such entities), persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issuance and at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. Furthermore, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S. holders that own Existing Notes that will be redeemed by the Issuer using the proceeds from the offering of the Notes, and who also acquire Notes. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level.

Although the issue is not free from doubt, the Issuer believes that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments due to the possibility of such a redemption occurring or such excess payments being made. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate different than their yield to maturity and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note.

Stated interest income generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered “passive category income.” A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign currency received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate of exchange in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, such holder may make an election (which must be applied 488 ----- consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.-source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or, at such holder’s election, a deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In such event, U.S. holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount exceeds the issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds the Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Notes as of the issue date. OID generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered “passive category income.” OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in the third paragraph under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as receipts of principal. Exchange 489 ----- gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Notes as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Note at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of that amount based on the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, accrued OID (which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest,” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of an individual U.S. holder, any such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.

The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

No key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation, for offering or selling any in scope instrument or otherwise making such instruments available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared. Offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the EU Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the EU Prospectus Regulation. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of the EUWA or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchaser that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.” We and Emil Holding II S.à r.l. have also agreed and the Guarantors (upon accession to the Purchase Agreement) will agree that we will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We have applied to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and trade the Notes on the Euro MTF Market, however, we cannot assure you that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchaser without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an active trading market _for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be ten business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement 498 ----- cycle is being referred to as “T + 10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next seven business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. In connection with the Offering, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (the “Stabilizing Manager”), or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—There may _not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchaser to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by a U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of Italy to that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set out above. In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian courts, Italian courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law 504 ----- that are regarded as mandatory, and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought (e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates any Italian public policies and/or any mandatory provisions of Italian law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.2,France,215.2.1,Recognition and enforcement of U.S. judgments in France,"One of the Guarantors is organized under the laws of France with its registered office or principal place of business in France (the “French Guarantor”). The directors, officers and other executives of the French Guarantor are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of the French Guarantor or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Notes against French Guarantor and/or French Individuals. The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. Judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment): (a) such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is substantially connected to the jurisdiction of such court, the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; (b) such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights, and in this respect, it should be noted that the scope and content of French international public policy are not precisely or exhaustively defined under French law and are determined by French courts on a case-by-case basis and may vary in time; (c) such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law; and (d) such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France. Where proceedings are pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and where these procedings have the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment, the courts may stay the exequatur proceedings. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80 538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities 505 ----- would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified from time to time, including as most recently by French Law No. 2022-52 of January 24, 2022 and, Regulation (EU) No. 2016-679 of April 27, 2016) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply all or part of foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French international public policy or (ii) in case of applicable overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French Individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). These provisions also apply in the context of non-contractual obligations. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. More specifically, according to a recent case law, a French defendant can no longer challenge the jurisdiction of a foreign tribunal on the basis of Article 15 of the French civil code in circumstances where the foreign tribunal has otherwise jurisdiction. In addition, French and foreign claimants may respectively waive their rights respectively to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. There are diverging positions amongst the chambers of the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) regarding the validity of a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction. On the one hand, further to several decisions – the most recent dated October 3, 2018 – the first civil chamber of the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) seems to consider that, unless the competent courts can be identified by reference to objective elements or jurisdiction rules in force in a Member State, unilateral jurisdiction clauses do not comply with the objective of foreseeability set out in the international instruments applicable in these cases and are therefore invalid. On the other hand, in a decision dated May 11, 2017, the commercial chamber of the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) held that a unilateral jurisdiction clause is valid. Accordingly, case-law regarding the validity of unilateral jurisdiction clauses can be regarded as highly uncertain. Any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents may therefore not be binding over the party submitted court.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.3,Germany,215.3.1,Recognition and enforcement of U.S. judgments in Germany,"We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, 506 ----- other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung) exist: - if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did not have jurisdiction; - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense, provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly; - if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; - if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before the U.S. federal or state court entered its judgment; - if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of German law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and - if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances). Subject to the foregoing, and after having received a recognition decision (Exequatur) from a competent German court, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets (vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provided for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. 507 ----- A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States. In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon a German Guarantor or those persons under the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. In the absence of an applicable convention between the United States of America and the Netherlands, a judgment rendered by a court in the United States of America will not be recognized and enforced by the Dutch courts. However, if a person has obtained a final and conclusive judgment for the payment of money rendered against a company by the foreign court which is enforceable in the U.S., and files his claim with the competent Dutch court, the Dutch court will generally give binding effect to the foreign judgment insofar as it finds that the jurisdiction of the foreign court has been based on grounds which are internationally acceptable and that proper legal procedures have been observed, and unless the foreign judgment contravenes Dutch public policy or is incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed in EUR at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in the Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies available in the courts of the Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

A final unappealable judgment obtained against Spanish companies outside of Spain (and, in particular, in the United States), other than in a country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (“EU Regulation 1215/2012”), would be recognized and enforced by the Courts of Spain (unless such judgment contravenes principles of Spanish public policy rules) pursuant to the following regimes: - according to the provisions of any applicable treaty (there being none currently in existence between Spain and the United States for these purposes); and in the absence of any such treaty (which is the case between the United States and Spain), the judgment would be enforced in Spain if it satisfies all of the following requirements in compliance with and subject to article 508 ----- 523 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law and subject to Law 29/2015, of July 30, on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters (Ley 29/2015, de 30 de julio, de Cooperación Jurídica Internacional en materia civil) (the “Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters”) which repeals articles 951 to 958 of the former Spanish Civil Procedure Law of 1881 (Real Decreto de Promulgación de 3 de febrero de 1881 de Enjuiciamiento Civil): ###### (a) such judgment is final and conclusive (firme); (b) such judgment was rendered by a Court having jurisdiction over the matter since the dispute is clearly connected to the relevant Court and the choice of the Court is not fraudulent; ###### (c) the judgment is not contrary to Spanish public policy rules (orden público) or mandatory provisions and the obligation to be fulfilled is legal in Spain; ###### (d) the documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement is accompanied by a literal, authentic, sworn Spanish translation; ###### (e) the copy of the judgment presented before the Spanish Court is duly apostilled; (f) there is not a pending previous proceeding between the same parties and in relation to the same issues in Spain; ###### (g) there is not an incompatible judgment rendered in Spain or previously rendered in another country-when this last judgment meets the requirements to be eventually recognized in Spain; ###### (h) where rendering the judgment, the Courts rendering it did not infringe an exclusive ground of jurisdiction provided for under Spanish law or based their jurisdiction on exorbitant grounds and the choice of Court is not fraudulent; ###### (i) that the foreign judgment meets the requirements provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Law if the issuer is subject to insolvency proceedings in Spain; ###### (j) the rights of defense of the defendant were protected where rendering the judgment, including, but not limited to, a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for the defendant to prepare its defense and the foreign judgment was not rendered by default (i.e., without appearance or without the possibility to appear for the defendant); and ###### (k) finally, although reciprocity is not a legal requirement, if it were proven that the foreign jurisdiction in which the judgment was obtained does not recognize judgments issued by Spanish Courts on a general basis, then the Spanish Courts could be compelled to deny the recognition of the foreign judgment in Spain. Any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequátur) with the relevant Spanish Judge of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil). Once a judgment has been recognized under the exequátur proceedings, it will be enforceable in Spain in accordance with the Spanish Civil Procedure Law in particular, it will be applicable the lapse of legal action (five years). According to article 3.2 of Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters, the Spanish Government may deny cooperation with other state’s authorities if there has been a repeated refusal of cooperation or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation by such other state’s authorities provided that the Spanish Government passes a Royal Decree for these purposes. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States of America could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by Spanish law (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in Spain or from Spanish persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Furthermore, and according to article 47 of Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters, there is a special provision and a special rule concerning the recognition of foreign judgments rendered in 509 ----- proceedings resulting from collective action, which may be enforced in Spain insofar as they satisfy the conditions set forth therein. The Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters expressly prohibits that a foreign judgment is reviewed as to its substance (revisión del fondo) by the competent Spanish Court. The Spanish Courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due and payable by the issuer or the Spanish Guarantors, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest will be paid in euros. Any judgment obtained against the issuer or any of the Spanish Guarantors in any country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby. The enforcement of any judgment in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs: (a) translation fees for documents in a language other than Spanish, which must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish; (b) foreign documents may be required to be legalized and apostilled; (c) certain professional fees for the verification of the legal representative of a party litigating in Spain, if needed; (d) judicial tax and fees; (e) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney at law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); and (f) the content and validity of foreign law must be evidenced to the Spanish Courts (which could, again, entail certain costs). In addition, it should be noted that Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes. As an alternative to the exequatur proceedings, the parties might agree to bring the original action to Spain, so that the dispute is settled by Spanish Courts. Pursuant to Article 54 of the current Spanish Civil Procedure Law, the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly agree to the submittal to one Judge (Juzgado) or Court (Tribunal) (provided that under the Spanish Civil Procedure Law and the Spanish Judicial Law (Ley _Orgánica 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, del Poder Judicial) the relevant Judge or Court is competent to solve the_ corresponding dispute); this article does not expressly cover the validity of nonexclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish Courts. If an original action is brought in Spain, the choice of law made by the parties may be rejected by Spanish Courts on grounds that it contravenes Spanish public policy rules (orden público).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, proceedings must first be initiated at common law before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, the English or the Welsh court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the courts of England and Wales can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English and Welsh court in such an action is conditional upon (among others) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English rules of private international law (in other words, it does not matter that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law or that the debtor appeared before a U.S. court, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international law); - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English or a Welsh court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law. 510 ----- An English or a Welsh court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that: - the U.S. judgment contravenes English or Welsh public policy or the European Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act; - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English or Welsh court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; - the English or Welsh enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the resolution of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be resolved otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English or Welsh court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. The foregoing assumes that such enforcement action takes place outside of any bankruptcy or insolvency process: it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The reporting date of all of the consolidated companies is 31 December. r The basis of consolidation is set out below: ###### - The line-by-line method, showing the portions of equity and profit or loss for the year attributable to non-controlling interests and recognising assets, liabilities, revenues and costs regardless of the percentage held in the subsidiaries. ###### - Eliminating items deriving from intragroup transactions involving consolidated companies, including any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions and recognising the resulting deferred tax effects. ###### - Eliminating intragroup dividends and reallocating them to opening equity reserves. - Eliminating the carrying amount of investments in consolidated companies and the relevant portion of equity, allocating the resulting positive and negative differences to the relevant captions (assets, liabilities and equity), as defined at the time of acquisition of the investment and considering any subsequent variations. After control is acquired, any acquisitions of non-controlling interests or sales of shares to non-controlling interests that do not entail loss of control are recognised as owner transactions and the relevant effects are taken directly to equity. Any differences between the change in equity attributable to non-controlling interests and cash and cash equivalents exchanged are recognised under changes in equity attributable to the owners of the parent. ###### - The financial statements of foreign operations are translated into Euros using the annual average rate for income statement items and the closing rate for statement of financial position items. The difference between the two rates along with the translation differences deriving from changes in opening and closing exchange rates are recognised as changes in equity.

To this end, the acquired identifiable assets and the assumed liabilities are recognised at their respective acquisition-date fair value. The consideration transferred in a business combination is the aggregate of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets acquired, assumed liabilities and equity instruments issued by the acquirer, in exchange for control of the acquiree. Goodwill is the positive difference between the consideration transferred, increased by both the fair value at the acquisition date of any non-controlling interests already held in the acquiree and the amount of non-controlling interests held in the acquiree by third parties (measured at fair value or based on the present value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets), and the fair value of such assets and liabilities. At the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to the single cash-generating unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. If the difference between the consideration transferred (increased by the above components) and the fair value of the net assets acquired is negative, this is recognised as a gain from a bargain purchase in the income statement in the year of acquisition. Any goodwill related to non-controlling interests is included in the carrying amount of the relevant equity investments. After initial recognition, goodwill is not amortised and is recognised net of any cumulative impairment losses, calculated using the methods set out in section [2.4.6] Impairment losses on assets.

Specifically, the standard sets out the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. IFRS 13 establishes a hierarchy that categorises the inputs used in the valuation techniques adopted to measure fair value into different levels, as follows: - level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access at the measurement date; - level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly; - level 3: inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The group recognises transfers among the different levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the periods in which the transfer took place. ----- Reference should be made to the notes to the individual financial statements’ items for the definition of the fair value hierarchy level used to classify the individual instruments measured at fair value or whose fair value is disclosed. The fair value of derivatives is calculated by discounting estimated cash flows using the market interest rates at the reporting date and the credit default swaps issued by the counterparty and group companies, to include the nonperformance risk explicitly provided for under IFRS 13. Where market prices are not available, the fair value of non-derivative medium/long-term financial instruments is calculated by discounting estimated cash flows using the market interest rates at the reporting date and considering counterparty risk for financial assets and credit risk for financial liabilities. IFRS 13 is a common framework for fair value measurement and relevant disclosure when this measurement is required or allowed by other IFRS.

IFRS 13 establishes a hierarchy that categorises the inputs used in the valuation techniques adopted to measure fair value into different levels, as follows: - level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access at the measurement date; - level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly; - level 3: unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities. In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The group recognises transfers among the different levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the year in which the transfer took place. Reference should be made to the notes to the individual financial statements’ items for the definition of the fair value hierarchy level used to classify the individual instruments measured at fair value or whose fair value is disclosed. The fair value of derivatives is calculated by discounting estimated cash flows using the market interest rates at the reporting date and the credit default swaps issued by the counterparty and group companies, to include the non-performance risk explicitly provided for under IFRS 13. Where market prices are not available, the fair value of non-derivative medium/long-term financial instruments is calculated by discounting estimated cash flows using the market interest rates at the reporting date and considering counterparty risk for financial assets and credit risk for financial liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

177_1,Final Offerings 2023.md,128,GLOSSARY,128.52,"[2.4.22] New standards and interpretations, revisions and amendments to existing standards",128.52.1,,"----- As required by IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, below are the new standards and interpretations, in addition to amendments to existing and applicable standards and interpretations, applicable starting from 1 January 2022 and not yet in effect at the reporting date. As required by IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, below are the new standards and interpretations, in addition to amendments to existing and applicable standards and interpretations, applicable starting from 1 January 2019 and not yet in effect at the reporting date. _New standards and interpretations applicable from 1 January 2019_ On 13 January 2016, the IASB published the new standard IFRS 16 Leases, which replaces IAS 17. The European Union endorsed the standard by publishing it on 9 November 2017. IFRS 16 applies to financial statements for years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The new standard eliminates the different treatment based on operating or finance leases, provides for a number of practical expedients for its initial application and introduces the concept of control to the definition of a lease. Specifically, to determine whether a contract is a lease, in accordance with IFRS 16, the lessee shall assess whether it conveys the right to use the underlying asset for a period of time. Earlier application was allowed for entities that also apply IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. In accordance with IFRS 16, the group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease on the basis of the new definition of leases. Under IFRS 16, the contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. In the case of a new lease, under the new standard, the group recognises a lease liability and a right-of-use asset measured as the present value of future payments. The amount of the lease liability to be recognised _Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial statements”)_ 17 ----- depends on the underlying assumptions in relation to the features of each type of lease and any renewal or termination options when considered reasonably certain at the time of recognition, as well as the discount rate applied. The lessee shall recognise interest on the lease liability and depreciation of the right-of-use asset separately. The lessee shall also remeasure the lease liability should certain events occur, such as a change in the lease term or a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in the reference index or rate. As mentioned earlier, the group’s consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019 were the first set prepared in compliance with the IFRS. In accordance with IFRS 1.7, the group restated the right-of-use assets at the transition date (1 January 2018) on the basis of an analysis of the lease contracts in place at such date. On first-time adoption, the group applied some of the practical expedients provided for by the standard. Specifically, it excluded leases with terms of twelve months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. For such exempt leases, the introduction of IFRS 16 did not entail the recognition of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, but the lease payments are taken to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term and the relevant liability is recognised under trade payables. Also subsequent to first-time adoption, the group decided not to apply IFRS 16 to short-term leases and lowvalue leases, which mainly refer to rental of IT devices and sporadic rental of goods for short periods of time. _New standards and interpretations applicable from 1 January 2020_ A number of amendments to IFRSs were adopted during the year, including the following - Amendments to IFRS 3 revised 'Business combinations', which provides clarification as to whether a Modifications to IFRS 3 revised 'Business combinations', which provides clarifications to determine whether a transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition. With regard to the distinction between the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an asset combination, the amendments IFRS 3 revised are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. A business is defined as an integrated set of activities and assets that can be conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or generating other income from ordinary activities. The acquisition of a business is to be accounted for as a business combination under IFRS 3 revised by applying the acquisition method, which, among other things, may result in the recognition of goodwill. Conversely, the acquisition of a group of assets that does not have market access is to be considered an acquisition of assets (group of assets acquisition); in asset acquisitions, the acquirer allocates the transaction price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair value and no goodwill is recognised. To date, these amendments have had no impact on the Group. - Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 on 'Reform of Interest Rate Reference Indices interest rates"" (so-called IBOR reform) that apply exclusively to hedging relationships directly affected by the reform of interest rate benchmarks. The amendments provide exceptions so that companies may continue to apply hedge accounting requirements assuming that the reference interest rate on which the hedged risk or the cash flows of the hedged item or the cash flows of the cash flows of the hedging instrument are not changed as a result of the IBOR reform. To date, these changes have not had an impact on the Group. - Amendments to IFRS 16 'Covid 19-Related Rent Concessions' which introduced a practical expedient to the section 'Lease Modifications' that allows the lessee to disregard any concessions on lease payments received after 1 January 2020 and arising from the effects of COVID-19 as an amendment to the original contract. Therefore, such concessions may be accounted for as positive variable lease payments without passing through a contractual amendment. In order to be able to apply this exemption, all the following conditions are met: - the concession on payments is a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction the payments relate only to those originally due until June 2021; - the change in payments has left unchanged, compared to the original conditions, the same amount to be paid or reduced the amount thereof; ######  there are no material changes to any other terms or conditions of the lease. _Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial statements”)_ 18 ----- On 29 March 2018, the IASB published an amendment to “References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards”. The Conceptual Framework defines the fundamental concepts for financial reporting. The document helps ensure that the Standards are conceptually consistent and that similar transactions are treated the same way, so as to provide useful information to investors, lenders and other creditors. The ”'Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of Materiality” aims to clarify the definition of materiality in order to help companies assess whether information is material and therefore to be included in the financial statements. In particular, it is specified that information is material if it is reasonable to assume that its omission, misstatement or concealment could influence the decisions that the main users of financial statements prepared for general purpose financial statements make on the basis of these financial statements, which provide financial information about the specific entity preparing the financial statements. The adoption of the other standards and interpretations detailed above has not had a material impact on the measurement of the group’s asset, liabilities, costs and revenue. _New standards and interpretations applicable from 1 January 2021_ The amendments to the IFRS adopted during the year included: - On 25 June 2020, the IASB published “Extension of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 (Amendments to IFRS 4)” which extends such exemption until annual periods beginning before 1 January 2023 for insurance companies. - On 27 August 2020, in light of the reform of interbank interest rates such as IBOR, the IASB published “Interest rate benchmark reform—Phase 2” which amends the following standards: - IFRS 9 Financial instruments; - IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement; - IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures; - IFRS 4 Insurance contracts; and - IFRS 16 Leases. All of the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. - On 31 March 2021, the IASB published “Covid-19-related rent concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (Amendments to IFRS 16)” which extends by twelve months the practical expedient introduced by the amendment issued in 2020 under which lessees can account for rent concessions that are a direct consequence of Covid-19 without assessing whether they are lease modifications. Accordingly, the lessees that applied such practical expedient in 2020 accounted for the effects of the rent concessions directly in profit or loss. Available only for lessees that had applied the 2020 amendment, the 2021 amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2021 and earlier application is permitted. The adoption of the other standards and interpretations detailed above has not had a material impact on the measurement of the group’s asset, liabilities, costs and revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Pursuant to IAS 36, goodwill is not subject to amortisation, but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. With regard to testing goodwill for impairment, the group identified a single operating CGU for its operations. It considered the sources of information set out by IAS 36 such as the fact that management monitors the group’s performance and takes strategic decisions about its product offering and investments at group level. The goodwill recognised in Limacorporate condensed consolidated interim financial statements in relation to the abovementioned merger, together with other items of goodwill, was tested for impairment as at 31 December 2021 and 2020 and at 30 June 2022. Specifically, the recoverable amount of the group’s assets was calculated by estimating their fair value and comparing it with the carrying amount of consolidated net invested capital at 31 December 2021 and at 30 June 2022 in order to examine whether recognised amounts had been impaired. ----- The market multiples method is used to determine the fair value of goodwill, using listed comparable companies. These multiples are compared with the implicit multiple calculated using the group’s actual figures. The market multiples analysis based on companies operating in sectors comparable to those of Limacorporate (performed on the date the impairment test was carried out on seven comparable companies) provides supporting evidence about the carrying amount of goodwill recognised in the 31 December 2021 and 2020 consolidated financial statements and 30 September 2022 condensed consolidated financial statements. This is because the market multiples (which show an average enterprise value of between 14,5 and 20 times gross operating profit) are higher and/or in line with the multiple obtained by comparing the group’s actual net invested capital at the end of 2021 (i.e., including goodwill) to consolidated gross operating profit. As a result of such checks, based on market references (i.e., market multiples) compared with the group’s implicit multiple, no impairment indicators have been detected to date for goodwill in the consolidated financial statements.

With regard to testing goodwill for impairment, the group identified a single operating CGU for its operations. Market multiples were used as external sources of information to calculate fair value.

The bonds were initially recognised at fair value, net of directly related costs, and measured at amortised cost by applying the effective interest rate method. The bonds have coupons based on the 3-month Euribor plus a 3.75% spread, with a Euribor floor threshold of 0.00%. They are listed on the Euro MTF market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the professional section of the ExtraMOT market of the Italian Stock Exchange. The coupons mature every three months on 15 February, 15 May, 15 August and 15 November each year starting from 15 November 2017. The following guarantees were issued in relation to the bonds: - pledge on the shares of Limacorporate S.p.A.; - pledge on the shares of some subsidiaries; - pledge on some of the current accounts of the parent and some subsidiaries; - special lien on plant, equipment and other items of property, plant and equipment of the parent; - lien on certain categories of assets of some subsidiaries; - guarantees on some categories of assets of the parent and some subsidiaries. In relation to the refinancing put in place in 2017, as well as the issue of bonds, Limacorporate also finalised an agreement for a new super senior revolving credit facility for a maximum of €60 million. It may also be used partially, in several instalments with set repayment terms. If the financial covenants are complied with, the interest rate is the same as the bond, i.e., 3-month Euribor plus a 3.75% spread, with a Euribor floor threshold of 0.00%. The same guarantees provided for the issue of the bonds were granted for this revolving credit facility; specifically: - pledge on the shares of Limacorporate S.p.A.; - pledge on the shares of some subsidiaries; - pledge on some of the current accounts of the parent and some subsidiaries; - special lien on plant, equipment and other items of property, plant and equipment of the parent; - lien on certain categories of assets of some subsidiaries; - guarantees on some categories of assets of the parent and some subsidiaries. €54 million, €47 million €49 million and € 40 million of the revolving facility was used at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively. If more than 35% (as explained in financing agreement) of the available amount of the revolving facility is used (i.e., drawdowns exceeding €21 million), a covenant related to the ratio of “Super Senior Net Debt” (represented by the utilization of the revolving facility less cash and cash equivalents) and consolidated EBITDA which cannot exceed 1.83, is activated under the terms of the contract. Such covenant was complied with at 30 September 2022 and 31 December 2021. For 31 December 2020 and 30 September 2021 was complied a different covenant in fact due to the global health emergency which has affected the countries where the group operates, this covenant was renegotiated in June 2020, at the time of the shareholder’s €20,000 thousand capital injection and additional commitment for a further injection of €15,000 thousand in the event the new covenant is not complied with. In brief, the measurement and check of the previous net financial position/EBITDA covenant was temporarily suspended until 30 September 2021, and was replaced with a new covenant linked to simply maintaining a minimum level of availability liquidity (€10,000 thousand), which includes the unused part of the revolving facility itself. The new covenant was comfortably complied with at 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020. On 11 August 2022, the Revolving Credit Facility was extended until 14 July 2023 under the same conditions. Non-current financial liabilities (“Other current financial liabilities”) and current financial liabilities (“Other loan and borrowing”) also include liabilities for the purchase of business units related to the amount due in 2023 for the acquisition of a business unit from the group’s Sicilian distributor. The non-current amount is €185 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020). The current amount is €nil at 30 September 2022 and 31 December 2021, €136 thousand and 30 September 2021 and €1,645 thousand at 31 December 2020. ----- The caption also includes the non-current portion of the medium/long-term loans taken out by the parent for the SICAT project and by some branches in relation to the relief available for the Covid-19 pandemic, detailed as follows (residual amount includes current and no current portion of medium/long- term loans): **30/09/2021** _(€'000)_",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

The above-mentioned allocation of shares in October 2021 led to a share capital increase for EmilNewCo and the recognition of an amount due from the founding shareholders of TechMah Medical equal to the liability recognised by Lima USA for the contractual milestones to be settled. The two transactions between the founding shareholders of Techmah Medical and Lima Group (EmilNewCo Sarl, Limacorporate S.p.A. and Lima USA) have been offset using claim notes, which generated the capital injection referred to above. b. capital injection by the shareholder of €20,000 thousand in June 2020. c. €3,088 thousand for the agreement with HSS (Hospital for Special Surgery).

Unlike accruals to the provision for risks, warranties and other provisions, accruals to agents’ termination indemnity are classified by nature among costs for services. The decreases of the period refer to utilisations of the provision following the termination of agency contracts and the release of the provision when not due. The relevant liabilities were subject to actuarial calculation by an independent expert. ----- Other provisions, amounting to €2,140 thousand, €2,997 thousand, €3,407 thousand and €2,820 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively, are comprised as follows: - the provision for charges of €1,573 thousand, €1,761 thousand, €1,373 thousand, and €750 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively, of which €1,573 thousand, €1,390 thousand, €1,036 thousand and €750 thousand related to commission expense on revenue yet to be invoiced and €0 thousand, €371 thousand, €0 thousand and € 0 thousand related to highly probable consultancy success fees the payment date of which is not yet known, both respectively at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020; - compensation for damage caused by products of €422 thousand, €423 thousand, €573 thousand and €630 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively. - other disputes/contingent liabilities of €145 thousand, €813 thousand, €1,461 thousand and €1,440 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively. The increase of the nine-month of 2021 and for the nine-month of 2022 mainly refer to provision for charges related to commission expenses on revenue due to the increase in volume and other disputes. The decreases of nine-month of 2022 mainly refer to the closure of litigation with a former agent that resulted in the release of the provision of €740 thousand. On December 4, 2019, the parent was notified of a preliminary assessment report following the completion of the tax assessment by the Friuli-Venezia Giulia regional tax authorities for 2016. On 3 February 2020, Limacorporate S.p.A. replied to such preliminary assessment report pursuant to article 12.7 of Law no. 212 of 27 July 2000, asking the tax authorities to recognise the lack of grounds of some of the allegations set out in the report and, accordingly, not to issue the assessment notices, reserving its right to present further pleadings and start negotiations with the tax authorities. To date, the tax authorities have not yet issued the assessment notice, which would enforce the notice, nor have the tax authorities agreed to hold negotiations as hoped by the parent, following the comments it filed pursuant to article 12.7 of Law no. 212 of 27 July 2000. Furthermore, based on the information available to date (also considering the specific comments issued by the parent), the risk of losing the case is estimated as possible. Moreover, such risk is currently difficult to quantify and is of an indeterminate amount, in light of the conclusions made by the parent and with no negotiations being held with the tax authorities. In light of the above, the parent decided not to make any accrual to the provision for risks. During the course of the third and fourth quarter of 2022, the Italian government has issued some decrees in relation to the so-called “pay-back” rule, according to which companies operating in the medical device sector are expected to contribute to the excess spending of local authorities (“Regioni” and “Province”) on purchases of medical devices for the years 2015 to 2018. On November 14, 2022, Limacorporate SpA has filed an appeal with the central administrative tribunal (“Tribunale Amministrativo del Lazio”) against the above mentioned decrees. During the course of the month of November 2022, some “Regioni” and “Province” have communicated to Limacorporate SpA their intention to proceed with the request for such “payback”. Two “Regioni” have additionally communicated the amount requested. Whilst Limacorporate SpA is fully convinced that its appeals will be successful, it cannot be certain of the outcome of the legal proceedings, nor is it in the position to estimate the amount of the potential liability that might arise.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

This committee is in charge of developing and monitoring the group’s risk management policies. |€'000|Decrease|Col3|30 September 2022|Increase|Col6| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |Equity Value Techma Liability|-10% 8|-5% 8.1|0% 8.1|5% 8.2|10% 8.3| ----- The group’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse any risks it is exposed to, establish appropriate limits and controls and monitor the risks and compliance with such limits. The committee regularly revisits the policies and related systems to align them with market developments and the group’s business. The group aims to create a disciplined and constructive control environment through training programmes, standards and management procedures so that its employees are familiar with their roles and responsibilities. The board of directors ensures compliance with the risk polices and management procedures and checks that the risk management system is appropriate to deal with risks that could affect the group. The group’s financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, loans, trade receivables and payables, current and non-current assets and liabilities as well as derivatives. In its normal business operations, the group is exposed to: - market risk, mainly currency and interest rate risks; - commercial or counterparty credit risks, related to the risk of default on commercial or financial obligations by various counterparties as part of normal business operations or lending, investment and hedging transactions; - liquidity risk, related to the availability of financial resources and access to the credit market and refers to the need to meet the group’s financial needs in the short term. Financial risk management is carried out centrally and essentially ensures that there are enough financial resources to meet business development needs and that resources are suitably invested in profitable activities. _Market risk_ Market risk can be broken down into the following components: - interest rate risk, - currency risk. _Interest rate risk_ The group’s exposure to interest rate risk is chiefly related to cash and cash equivalents, bonds and bank loans and borrowings, especially the revolving credit facility that is managed centrally. On 30 September 2022 and 30 September 2021 the group does not have any interest rate hedges. A 100bps increase in the interest rate applied would have led to an increase in financial expense of roughly €3.3 million. _Currency risk_ As the group sells its products in various countries, it is exposed to currency risk. This risk mainly derives from sales in currencies other than the Euro, like the US dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and Australian dollar. The group regularly assesses its exposure to market financial risks. It does not manage such risks by using derivatives. _Credit risk_ Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument may default on a contractual obligation generating a loss for the group. It mainly arises on trade receivables and debt instruments. The group’s maximum exposure to this type of risk is the assets’ carrying amount. Some of the markets on which the group operates have a higher level of risk, such as southern Italy, where the health system is deeply in debt, southern European countries, like Spain and Portugal, and eastern European countries, such as Croatia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where collection times are very long. Most of the group’s receivables are due from public institutions, thus solely linked to the country risk. Moreover, payments from public administration have improved notably in some cases in recent years thanks to measures taken to cut public entity debt with private companies. ----- Credit risk is also mitigated by the fact that the group is increasing its sales in countries with shorter average collection times. Therefore, the weight of markets with higher credit risk will be reduced. At 30 September 2022 and 2021, the group does not have exposures with individual customers for more than 10% of its total trade receivables. The amount of financial assets for which recovery is doubtful is immaterial in terms of the total amount of receivables and is, in any case, covered by adequate accruals to the relevant allowances. _Liquidity risk_ Liquidity risk derives from the ability to obtain financial resources at a sustainable cost to carry out the group’s normal business operations. The group uses the usual tools to manage current trade receivables, as well as partially using the facilities available. Moreover: - the group has debt instruments and credit lines to deal with liquidity requirements; there are no significant concentrations of liquidity risk with regard to financial assets.Further detail are included in Going concerned paragraph.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Assumptions about the fair value of the share-based payment plans are based on the Monte Carlo method (by simulating the group’s gross operating profit and equity value). In previous years, the parent had defined two types of plans: |Col1|30/09/2022|Q3 2022|30/09/2021|Q3 2021|Variation 30/09/2022 - 30/09/2021| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |Management remuneration|2 ,485|58|706|54|1,778| |Total|2 ,485|58|706|54|1,778| ----- - **Virtual share plan** **(“VSP”) On 23 November 2016, the parent’s shareholders approved the 2016-2030 virtual share plan for one of its managers. This includes the free award of options to subscribe the parent’s ordinary shares. The manager has the right to receive a number of options each year calculated using a pre-set formula. The plan vests on 31 December 2030 although this date may be brought forward in the case of i) an IPO, ii) a change of control, or iii) leaver events that lead to the beneficiary leaving the parent. The manager’s right to exercise the options vests in line with their continued employment relationship with the events i), ii) and ii) being early exercise events. This plan qualifies as a cash-settled plan under IFRS 2. Its fair value was calculated using market models and the market data at the reporting dates (such as interest rate curves, historical price curves of listed comparable companies’ shares, price volatility of listed comparable companies’ shares) as well as non-market conditions (the probability that the above events will take place). The parent updates the calculation each period. Following the step down from the role of CEO (the only beneficiary of the VSP) in the first half of 2022, the VSP amount has been defined and paid in two tranche: the first has been paid in has been paid in May 2022 and the second will be paid in November 2022. - **MPP plan In September 2016, the parent introduced an incentive plan for some group employees who signed agreements with Emil Holding I (Emil Holding II’s controlling shareholder providing for i) the award of shares of Emil Holding II (the company that manages and coordinates the parent) to the plan beneficiaries, ii) the granting of call options by the beneficiaries to Emil Holding I whereby Emil Holding I can acquire the shares held by the beneficiaries if certain events occur, iii) the granting of put options by Emil Holding I to the beneficiaries whereby the latter can sell their shares in Emil Holding II at the same conditions set for the call option, generating an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid by the beneficiaries (on the subscription date or deferred) and the carrying amount of the shares at the option exercise date. The options can be exercised if one of the events occurs. This plan qualifies as a cash-settled plan under IFRS 2. Its fair value was calculated using market models and the market data at the reporting dates (such as interest rate curve) as well as non-market conditions (the probability that the above leaver events will take place). The plan liability represents the plan’s future value less the cost incurred by each beneficiary as its initial investment to enter the plan. The parent updates the calculation each year. These plans led to recognition of a non-current liability of €0 million, €4,8 million, €4,8 million and €5,2 million at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively and costs of services of €941 thousand at 30 September 2022 and €466 thousand at 30 September 2021. Additionally, in June 2022 Emil Holding I and certain employees agreed a share-based bonus payment to be activated at the occurrence of certain events. Such bonus payment has been accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment, its fair value being recognized as personnel expenses from the grant date until the expected duration of the vesting period, with a corresponding increase of an equity reserve. This plan led to a recognition of personnel expenses of €1,989 thousand at 30 September 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

Moreover, based on the characteristics of its markets and the backlog of elective surgeries accumulated over these past two years, management is confident that demand will exceed pre-pandemic levels in the medium term and resume its previous trend, which is also linked to the demographic trend. Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of Banca d’Italia/Consob/Isvap document no. 2 of 6 February 2009 and IAS 1.25-26, based on the above and on financial support confirmation from parent company EQT Luxembourg Management S.à.r.l., the directors believe that going concern is comfortably ensured, even in the current uncertain macroeconomic context.

The directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern and for the appropriate use of the going concern basis in the preparation of the three-year financial statements and for the adequacy of the related disclosures. The use of this basis of accounting is appropriate unless the directors believe that the conditions for liquidating the parent or ceasing operations exist or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The Collegio Sindacale is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by the Italian law, the group’s financial reporting process. ###### Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the three-year financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the three-year financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA Italia will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these three-year financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISA Italia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: ###### — identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the three-year consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; ###### — obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control; ###### — evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors; ###### — conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the three-year financial statements or, if such disclosures ----- _Independent auditors’ report 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019_ are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern; ###### — evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the three-year financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the three-year financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; ###### — obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

The transactions that affected this caption during the three-year period are summarised below: I. €4,963 thousand for the contribution in kind made in 2021 by the shareholder for the acquisition of TechMah Medical. The contribution in kind is directly related to the shared-based payment of certain milestones regarding the acquisition of TechMah Medical. Under the agreement signed in 2018, the subsidiary Lima USA allocated the founding shareholders of TechMah Medical a set number of new EmilNewCo Sarl (indirect parent of Limacorporate S.p.A. with a 100% interest) shares upon reaching set targets regarding the development of new products benefiting the group. The above-mentioned allocation of shares in October 2021 led to a share capital increase for EmilNewCo and the recognition of an amount due from the founding shareholders of TechMah Medical equal to the liability recognised by Lima USA for the contractual milestones to be settled. The two transactions between the founding shareholders of Techmah Medical and Lima Group (EmilNewCo Sarl, Limacorporate S.p.A. and Lima USA) have been offset using claim notes, which generated the capital injection referred to above.

On 3 February 2020, Limacorporate replied to such preliminary assessment report pursuant to article 12.7 of Law no. 212 of 27 July 2000, asking the tax authorities to recognise the lack of grounds of some of the allegations set out in the report and, accordingly, not to issue the assessment notices, reserving its right to present further pleadings and start negotiations with the tax authorities. To date, the tax authorities have not yet issued the assessment notice, which would enforce the notice, nor have the tax authorities agreed to hold negotiations as hoped by the parent, following the comments it filed pursuant to article 12.7 of Law no. 212 of 27 July 2000. Furthermore, based on the information available to date (also considering the specific comments issued by the parent), the risk of losing the case is estimated as possible. Moreover, such risk is currently difficult to quantify and is of an indeterminate amount, in light of the conclusions made by the parent and with no negotiations being held with the tax authorities.

On 17 August 2017, the parent issued senior secured bonds, redeemable in 2023, for a total nominal amount of €275 million. The bonds have coupons based on the 3-month Euribor plus a 3.75% spread, with a Euribor floor threshold of 0.00%. They are listed on the Euro MTF market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the professional section of the ExtraMOT market of the Italian Stock Exchange. The coupons mature every three months on 15 February, 15 May, 15 August and 15 November each year starting from 15 November 2017. The bonds are measured at amortised cost and, therefore, the relevant balance is stated net of deferred charges incurred to issue them. The following guarantees were issued in relation to the bonds: ###### - pledge on the shares of Limacorporate S.p.A.; - pledge on the shares of some subsidiaries; - pledge on some of the current accounts of the parent and some subsidiaries; - special lien on plant, equipment and other items of property, plant and equipment of the parent; - lien on certain categories of assets of some subsidiaries; - guarantees on some categories of assets of the parent and some subsidiaries. In relation to the refinancing put in place in 2017, as well as the issue of bonds, Limacorporate also finalised an agreement for a new super senior revolving credit facility for a maximum of €60 million on 8 August 2017. The same guarantees provided for the issue of the bonds were granted for this revolving credit facility; specifically: ###### - pledge on the shares of Limacorporate S.p.A.; - pledge on the shares of some subsidiaries; - pledge on some of the current accounts of the parent and some subsidiaries; - special lien on plant, equipment and other items of property, plant and equipment of the parent; - lien on certain categories of assets of some subsidiaries; - guarantees on some categories of assets of the parent and some subsidiaries.

In brief, the measurement and check of the previous net financial position/EBITDA covenant was temporarily suspended until 30 September 2021 and was replaced with a new covenant linked to simply maintaining a minimum level of availability liquidity (€10,000 thousand), which includes the unused part of the revolving facility itself.

Like the above loans, the Austrian group company applied for this loan to offset the negative economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The subsidised interest rate applied is 0.00% until August 2022 after which it will be the 3M Euribor + 0.75%; The residual amount at 31 December 2021 is €150 thousand (€50 thousand current); ###### - loan of €593 thousand granted by Banca Agricola Commerciale in San Marino to Lima SM in June 2011. The subsidised interest rate applied is 5% of Euribor + 2%. At 31 December 2020 and 2019, the parent still had to repay €30 thousand and €89 thousand, respectively. At 31 December 2021 the loan was totally refunded. Other financial liabilities and Other loans and borrowings - both current and non-current - include mainly the amounts yet to be paid in relation to the acquisition of TechMah Medical LLC (contingent consideration). The liability variation depends on the payments occurred during the period and its fair value. This liability was measured by an independent expert with reference to the acquisition date and subsequently updated at each year end. The difference on the previous year end is taken to profit or loss under financial expense. On 25 September 2017, the parent entered into an agreement with the agency M.T. Ortho to acquire its business unit comprising the components organised for the marketing, sale and after-sales assistance of Lima medical devices in Sicily and Calabria. Specifically, the business unit included: ###### - ongoing supply contracts with the healthcare facilities; - supply contracts under negotiation; - goodwill. The consideration of €3.7 million was to be paid as follows: ###### - €740 thousand when the transaction was finalised; - €2,960 thousand in six annual instalments through 2023, the payment of which depends on whether a certain level of sales is maintained in the region until the payment is complete. During 2020, the repayment of a total of €2,940 thousand was rescheduled. The increase in other current liabilities compared with 2019, relating only to the portion due within one year, is linked to the renegotiation of the agreement in late 2019, accelerating the payment of the remaining 2021 instalments of €1,645 thousand against a €20 thousand decrease in the liability and the renegotiation of the commissions in the region. The remaining portion of the other financial liabilities relates to the acquisition of MT Ortho: ###### - a non-current portion of €185 thousand at 31 December 2021, €185 thousand at 31 December 2020, and € 1,850 thousand at 31 December 2019; ###### - a current portion of €0 thousand at 31 December 2021 €1,645 thousand at 2020 and €555 thousand at 31 December 2019. Finally, financial liabilities include lease liabilities deriving from the application of IFRS 16.

Financial risk management,128.396.1,,"The group is exposed to the following risks deriving from its use of financial instruments: - credit risk; - liquidity risk; - market risk. _Risk management system_ Overall responsibility for the design and oversight of the group’s risk management system lies with the parent’s board of directors. This committee is in charge of developing and monitoring the group’s risk management policies. The group’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse any risks it is exposed to, establish appropriate limits and controls and monitor the risks and compliance with such limits. The committee regularly revisits the policies and related systems to align them with market developments and the group’s business. The group aims to create a disciplined and constructive control environment through training programmes, standards and management procedures so that its employees are familiar with their roles and responsibilities. The board of directors ensures compliance with the risk polices and management procedures and checks that the risk management system is appropriate to deal with risks that could affect the group. The group’s financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, loans, trade receivables and payables, current and non-current assets and liabilities as well as derivatives. In its normal business operations, the group is exposed to: _Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial statements”)_ 55 ----- market risk, mainly currency and interest rate risks; commercial or counterparty credit risks, related to the risk of default on commercial or financial obligations by various counterparties as part of normal business operations or lending, investment and hedging transactions; liquidity risk, related to the availability of financial resources and access to the credit market and refers to the need to meet the group’s financial needs in the short term. Financial risk management is carried out centrally and essentially ensures that there are enough financial resources to meet business development needs and that resources are suitably invested in profitable activities. _Market risk_ Market risk can be broken down into the following components: ###### - interest rate risk, - currency risk. _Interest rate risk_ The group’s exposure to interest rate risk is chiefly related to cash and cash equivalents, bonds and bank loans and borrowings, especially the revolving credit facility that is managed centrally. At 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019, the group does not have any interest rate hedges. A 100bps increase in the interest rate applied would have led to an increase in financial expense of roughly €3.3 million, €3 million and €2 million al 31 December 2021,2020 and 2019, respectively. _Currency risk_ As the group sells its products in various countries, it is exposed to currency risk. This risk mainly derives from sales in currencies other than the Euro, like the US dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and Australian dollar. The group regularly assesses its exposure to market financial risks. It does not manage such risks by using derivatives. Its exposure in relation to foreign currency assets and liabilities is detailed in the following table (countervalue of the respective currencies in Euro): _Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial statements”)_ 56 ----- _(€'000)_",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

It mainly arises on trade receivables and debt instruments. The group’s maximum exposure to this type of risk is the assets’ carrying amount. Some of the markets on which the group operates have a higher level of risk, such as southern Italy, where the health system is deeply in debt, southern European countries, like Spain and Portugal, and eastern European countries, such as Croatia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where collection times are very long. Most of the group’s receivables are due from public institutions, thus solely linked to the country risk. Moreover, payments from public administration have improved notably in some cases in recent years thanks to measures taken to cut public entity debt with private companies. Credit risk is also mitigated by the fact that the group is increasing its sales in countries with shorter average collection times. Therefore, the weight of markets with higher credit risk will be reduced. At 31 December 2019, 2020 and 2021, the group does not have exposures with individual customers for more than 10% of its total trade receivables. Its top ten customers account for around 6.5%, 7% and 6% of total trade receivables at 31 December 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The amount of financial assets for which recovery is doubtful is immaterial in terms of the total amount of receivables and is, in any case, covered by adequate accruals to the relevant allowances.

The new facility, operated by the American group company, Lima USA, on the HSS main campus on New York’s Upper East Side, will leverage the combination of Lima’s advanced technology and experience and HSS’s expertise in clinical care and biomechanical engineering. The collaboration will foster and accelerate innovation in complex orthopaedic joint care resulting in new products and solutions for patients across the US. Lima will be the registered manufacturer for all devices designed and produced at this new, state-of-theart facility, located at HSS. The facility will initially serve hospitals in the region before making the devices available to all providers in the US.

The parent does not carry out transactions with other entities related to government bodies, such as, for example, the sale and purchase of goods and materials, the supply or receipt of services, leasing of assets or use of public services. Financial transactions with the ultimate parent are part of the parent’s normal business operations and take place at conditions similar to those applied to transactions with entities unrelated to government bodies. Limacorporate has purchase and sales procedures for financial services that it applies to both third parties and entities related to government bodies. The only non-recurring transaction with Emil Holding II S.à.r.l. during the 2019-2020 period was the €20 million capital injection made by the ultimate parent in June 2020 to renegotiate the new covenant on the revolving credit facility and in 2021 was the €4,963 thousand contribution in kind made by the shareholder in October 2021 as part of the transaction to invest in the subsidiary TechMah Medical Llc..

Assumptions about the fair value of the share-based payment plans are based on the Monte Carlo method (by simulating the group’s EBITDA and equity value). In previous years, the parent had defined two types of plan: ###### - Virtual share plan (“VSP”) On 23 November 2016, the parent’s shareholders approved the 2016-2030 virtual share plan for one of its managers. This includes the free award of options to subscribe the parent’s ordinary shares. The manager has the right to receive a number of options each year calculated using a pre-set formula. The plan vests on 31 December 2030 although this date may be brought forward in the case of i) an IPO, ii) a change of control, or iii) leaver events that lead to the beneficiary leaving the parent. The manager’s right to exercise the options vests in line with their continued employment relationship with the events i), ii) and ii) being early exercise events. This plan qualifies as a cash-settled plan under IFRS 2. Its fair value was calculated using market models and the market data at the reporting dates (such as interest rate curves, historical price curves _Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial statements”)_ 67 |Variation Variation 2021 2020 2019 2021vs2020 2020vs2019|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |Statutory auditors' fees 57 58 60 (1) (2)|||||| |Directors’ fees 741 701 1,446 40 (745)|||||| |Total|798|759|1,506|39|(746)| ----- of listed comparable companies’ shares, price volatility of listed comparable companies’ shares) as well as non-market conditions (the probability that the above events will take place). The parent updates the calculation each year. ###### - MPP plan In September 2016, the parent introduced an incentive plan for some group employees who signed agreements providing for i) the award of shares of Emil Holding II (the company that manages and coordinates the parent) to the plan beneficiaries, ii) the granting of call options by the beneficiaries to Emil Holding I whereby Emil Holding I can acquire the shares held by the beneficiaries if certain events occur, iii) the granting of put options by Emil Holding I to the beneficiaries whereby the latter can sell their shares in Emil Holding II at the same conditions set for the call option, generating an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid by the beneficiaries (on the subscription date or deferred to the farthest away of the exit date - the listing of Emil Holding II or a group company that directly or indirectly holds all or nearly all of the group’s assets, the sale of at least most of the assets or the winding up of Emil Holding II - and 31 December 2028) and the carrying amount of the shares at the option exercise date. The options can be exercised if one of the events occurs. This plan qualifies as a cash-settled plan under IFRS 2. Its fair value was calculated using market models and the market data at the reporting dates (such as interest rate curve) as well as non-market conditions (the probability that the above leaver events will take place). The plan liability represents the plan’s future value less the cost incurred by each beneficiary as its initial investment to enter the plan. The parent updates the calculation each year. These plans led to recognition of a non-current liability of €4.8 million at 31 December 2021 and benefit of services and personnel expenses for the year of €340 thousand (respectively €5.2 million and 1.5 million for 2020 and €3.7 million and €1.1 million for 2019).",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

This meant the pandemic was more manageable and normality was partially restored in early 2022. The state of emergency, at least in Italy and Europe, will probably be lifted in spring. In relation to events after the reporting date, the growing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine exploded into armed conflict in late February following the Russian army’s invasion of the country. Still under way, it is impossible to predict how the conflict will evolve in the medium term. However, the group does not have any significant direct customers in this area, with combined sales in the two countries counting for less than 0.5% of its revenue, and has no direct suppliers there. The indirect repercussions of the conflict, on the other hand, will see a further increase in inflation, especially in energy prices, but also in the medium term affecting certain raw materials used by the group, with potential impacts on sales margins. There were no other significant events after the reporting date.",N/A,as_expected,2023,652

However, the extremely high vaccination rates in some countries, the individual containment and protection measures adopted and the reduced number of hospitalisations and deaths caused by the Omicron variant made the still present public health emergency more manageable. _Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial statements”)_ 68 ----- Indeed, as demonstrated by the results set out above and despite the resurgence of global sales falling short of expectations, the group was able to contain its operating costs and, thus, meet very satisfactory financial and profit targets. Together with its confirmed financial soundness, this means that the group is well placed to cover its operating requirements and future development plans. Moreover, based on the characteristics of its markets and the backlog of elective surgeries accumulated over these past two years, management is confident that demand will exceed pre-pandemic levels in the medium term and resume its previous trend, which is also linked to the demographic trend. Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of Banca d’Italia/Consob/Isvap document no. 2 of 6 February 2009 and IAS 1.25-26, based on the above and on financial support confirmation from parent company EQT Luxembourg Management S.à.r.l., the directors believe that going concern is comfortably ensured, even in the current uncertain macroeconomic context. _Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial statements”)_ 69 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,652
