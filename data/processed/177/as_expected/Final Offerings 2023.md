The Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to the sum of three-month EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) plus 5.75%, payable quarterly in arrears on February 1,
May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2023. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2028. The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time
on or after February 1, 2024 at the redemption prices in this offering memorandum. At any time prior to February 1, 2024, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion
of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus a “make-whole” premium, as
described in this offering memorandum. Prior to February 1, 2024, the Issuer may redeem on one or more occasions up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes
(including any Additional Notes (as defined herein)) using the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 100% plus the Applicable Rate (as defined herein)
in effect on the date of the applicable redemption notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption; provided that at least 50% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) remains outstanding after the redemption. The Issuer may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon
the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control or upon the occurrence of certain asset sales, the Issuer may

to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
indebtedness and will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Within
90 days following the Issue Date, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer will accede to the Indenture as guarantors and provide guarantees of the Notes (the “Guarantees”) thereunder (collectively,
the “Guarantors”). The Guarantees will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein) and certain limitations under applicable law as described under “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and may be released in certain circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—_
_The Note Guarantees.” The Guarantee of the Notes by each Guarantor will rank_ _pari passu_ in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that is not
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee and senior in right of payment to all of the existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is subordinated in right
of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee, will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not secure
such Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness, and will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of such Guarantor’s subsidiaries that
do not guarantee the Notes.

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by security interests over certain assets of the Parent (as defined herein), the Issuer and the Guarantors (collectively,
the “Collateral”). Security interests in the shares of the Issuer and certain assets of the Parent and the Issuer comprising the Collateral will be granted on or about the Issue Date. Security

the Issue Date. The Collateral will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) on a pari passu basis; however the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations,
if any, will receive priority with respect to the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral. The security interests over the Collateral will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as
defined herein), certain limitations under applicable law and certain perfection requirements, and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability
_of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,” “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our indebtedness and the Notes—The enforcement of the Collateral will_
_require clearance under the Italian Golden Power Legislation,” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes,” the Issuer will not be liable to pay any Additional Amounts (as defined herein) to holders of the Notes in relation to, among other
things, any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time) where the
Notes are held by a person resident in a country that does not allow for satisfactory exchange of information with Italy (included in the list issued under Article 11, paragraph 4, letter c) of
Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as currently identified by the Italian Tax Authorities in the Italian Ministerial Decree dated September 4, 1996, as subsequently amended or supplemented)
and otherwise in circumstances as described in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts.”

for the relevant definitive Notes only in certain limited circumstances. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**Notice to certain investors**

**European Economic Area**

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”), (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129
(as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State
of the EEA that is subject to the Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. This offering
memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the Prospectus Regulation.

**_MiFID II Product Governance_**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person

iii


-----

subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Republic of Italy**

The Offering has not been registered with the _Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa_
(“CONSOB”) (the Italian securities exchange commission), pursuant to Italian securities legislation and will not
be subject to formal review or clearance by CONSOB. Accordingly, no Notes may be offered, sold or delivered,
directly or indirectly nor may copies of this offering memorandum or of any other offering circular, prospectus,
form of application, advertisement or other offering material or document relating to the Notes to be issued, be

qualified investors (investitori qualificati) as referred to in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation; or (b) in any
other circumstances which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 1 of the Prospectus
Regulation, Article 100 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 2998, as amended (the “Italian
**Financial Act”), Article 34-ter of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999, as amended (the “Issuer**
**Regulation”), and the applicable Italian laws and regulations.**

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that any offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or
distribution of copies of this offering memorandum or of any other document relating to the Notes in the Republic
of Italy will be carried out in accordance with all Italian securities, tax and exchange control and other applicable
laws and regulations.

Any such offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or distribution of copies of this offering memorandum or
any other document relating to the Notes in the Republic of Italy must be in compliance with the selling restrictions
under (a) and (b) above and must be:

(a) made by _soggetti abilitati_ (including investment firms, banks or financial
intermediaries, as defined by Article 1, first paragraph, letter r, of the Italian Financial Act), to the extent
duly authorized to engage in the placement and/or underwriting and/or purchase of financial instruments
in the Republic of Italy in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Italian Financial Act, Regulation
No. 20307 of February 15, 2018, as amended (“Regulation 20307”), Italian Legislative Decree No. 385
of September 1, 1993, as amended (the “Italian Banking Act”), the Issuer Regulation and any other
applicable laws and regulations; and

(b) in compliance with all relevant Italian securities, tax, exchange control and any other
applicable laws and regulations and any other applicable requirement or limitation that may be imposed
from time to time by CONSOB, the Bank of Italy (including, the reporting requirements, where
applicable, pursuant to Article 129 of the Italian Banking Act and the implementing guidelines of the
Bank of Italy, as amended from time to time) or any other relevant Italian competent authorities.

Prospectus Regulation, the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980 of March 14, 2019, the German
Securities Prospectus Act (Wertpapierprospektgesetz), as amended, or any other laws applicable in Germany
governing the issue, offering and sale of securities. This offering memorandum has not been approved under the
Prospectus Regulation and, accordingly, the Notes may not be offered publicly in the Federal Republic of
Germany. Consequently, in Germany the Notes will only be available to, and this offering memorandum and any

_Anleger) within the meaning of Section 2 No. 3 of the German Securities Prospectus Act in connection with_
Article 2 lit. e of the Prospectus Regulation. Any resale of the Notes in Germany may only be made in accordance

notification to BaFin from another competent authority of a member state of the EU, with which a securities
prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to Article 25 of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Spain**

Neither the Offering nor this offering memorandum and its content has been registered with the Spanish
National Securities Market Commission (Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores) (the “CNMV”) and
therefore the Notes may not be offered, sold or distributed in Spain by any means, except in circumstances which
do not require the registration of a prospectus in Spain in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation and the
Restated Spanish Securities Market Act approved by Royal Legislative Decree 4/2015, of October 23 (Texto
_refundido de la Ley del Mercado de Valores aprobado por el Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2015, de 23 de octubre),_
(as amended and restated from time to time, the “Spanish Securities Market Act”), and any regulation
developing it which may be in force from time to time. Offers of Notes in Spain shall only be directed specifically
at, or made to, professional clients and eligible counterparties, as defined in articles 205 and 207 of the Spanish
Securities Market Act.

**United Kingdom**

This offering memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the UK and is for
distribution only to, and is directed only at, persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to
investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion)
Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to
(d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are
outside the UK or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within
the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) in connection with the
issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such
persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons”). This offering memorandum is directed only at
Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not Relevant Persons. Any investment
or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is permitted only by Relevant Persons and will
be engaged in only with Relevant Persons.

No part of this offering memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or otherwise made

invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA)

of the FSMA does not apply to us.

**_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”);
(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document
required by the PRIIPs Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA
(the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of securities. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.


-----

**_UK MiFIR Product Governance_**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the such securities is only eligible
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as
defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to the FCA Handbook Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES**

**Financial Statements**

All historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is that of the Issuer and its
consolidated subsidiaries. In particular, this offering memorandum includes:

(i) the audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the years ended December 31,
2019, 2020 and 2021 (the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards endorsed by the European Union (“IFRS”); and

(ii) the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022 (the “Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial
**Statements” prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards 34: Interim Financial Reporting,**
endorsed by the EU and, together with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Consolidated
**Financial Statements”).**

The information in this offering memorandum relating to revenue generated by product line and
geography is based on the financial information we use to monitor the performance of the business. Management
believes that the information by product line and geography provided is useful in understanding the underlying
trends of the business. In this offering memorandum, we present our revenue generated by (i) the following five
geographical areas: Europe (excluding Italy), Italy, Asia-Pacific (“APAC”), United States and the countries in
the world outside of Europe (including Italy), APAC and the United States (“Rest of the World”); and (ii) the
following four product lines: extremities, knee, hip and fixation and other.

The Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum should be read
in conjunction with the relevant notes thereto. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial information contained in
this offering memorandum has been prepared in accordance with IFRS.

**Other Financial Measures and Ratios**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain unaudited non-IFRS measures and ratios, such as Cost
of Goods Sold, Gross Profit, EBITDA, Reported EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Reported
EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Capital Expenditures, Maintenance Capital Expenditures, Growth
Capital Expenditures, Gross Margin, Total Debt, Net Debt, Net Working Capital, Other Operating Cash Flow,
Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, Net Interest Paid, Change in Financial Debt and
Liquidity (each as defined herein) that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. We believe
that non-IFRS financial measures are a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and
can assist certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of
performance and liquidity. We believe that Reported EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are relevant measures for
assessing our performance because they are adjusted for certain items which, we believe, are not indicative of our
underlying operating performance and thus aid in an understanding of EBITDA. We present non-IFRS financial
measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities
analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. However, non-IFRS
financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have
limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our
operating results as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures and ratios are not measurements of our
performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other
performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or
as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities.

In particular, our EBITDA-based measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not
consider them in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of our results or any performance measures under
IFRS as set forth in our financial statements. Some of these limitations, as applicable, are:

    - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or
contractual commitments;

    - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

    - they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

iii


-----

    - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

    - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our income
statement;

    - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA measures do not reflect any cash
requirements that would be required to make such replacements;

    - they do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be
indicative of our ongoing operations; and

    - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently from the way we do,
limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

In addition, our calculation and presentation of EBITDA-based measures in this offering memorandum
are different from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA contained in the section entitled “Description of the
_Notes” of this offering memorandum, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Accordingly,_
the EBITDA-based measures presented in this offering memorandum may not provide precise indications as to
the level of our adherence to the terms of the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Reported EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be
considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures
of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying
primarily on our results reported under IFRS and using these non-IFRS financial measures only to supplement
your evaluation of our performance.

In this offering memorandum, we present a reconciliation of each of the non-IFRS financial measures to
the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and discuss its
limitations. For a reconciliation of these non-IFRS financial measures, please refer to “Summary Historical
_Condensed Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial Data.”_

Our non-IFRS financial measures are defined by us as follows:

    - We define “EBITDA” as earnings (profit (loss) for the period), before interest, taxes (income taxes),
depreciation and amortization.

    - We define “EBITDA Margin” as EBITDA for each period as a percentage of revenue for the same
period.

    - We define “Reported **EBITDA” as EBITDA adjusted for exchange gains and losses and financial**
income/expense for adjusting liabilities to fair value.

    - We define “Reported **EBITDA Margin” as Reported EBITDA for each period as a percentage of**
revenue for the same period.

    - We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as Reported EBITDA adjusted for accrual and release of
provisions for risks and charges, other impairment losses, bad debt provisions, advisors’ and other
costs for one-off transactions, start-up costs of TechMah and HSS and costs relating to
reorganizations within the Group.

    - We define “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA for each period as a percentage of
revenue for the same period.

    - We define “Capital Expenditures” as the increases in property, plant and equipment and other
intangible assets. For internal purposes, we additionally classify our Capital Expenditures into: (i)
Growth Capital Expenditures, which we define as increases in property, plant and equipment and
other intangible assets which, in each case, are discretionary and utilized to expand our business or
to increase the long-term operating capacity of our assets or our operating income; and (ii)
Maintenance Capital Expenditures, which we define as increases in property, plant and equipment

i


-----

and other intangible assets which, in each case, are utilized to maintain the efficiency or increase the
longevity of our capital assets.

    - We define “Cash Conversion” as cash flows from operating activities for each period as a
percentage of Adjusted EBITDA for the same period.

    - We define “Cost of Goods Sold” as costs and expenses directly associated with the production of
products, including costs of the raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods, direct labor costs
and amounts paid to third-party service providers. Cost of Goods Sold does not, however, include
general overhead expenses.

    - We define “Gross Profit” as revenue less Cost of Goods Sold.

    - We define “Gross Margin” as revenue for the period less the Costs of Goods Sold for the period as
a percentage of revenue for such period.

    - We define “Total Debt” as the sum of our indebtedness under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility, the Existing Notes, lease liabilities, and other financial liabilities.

    - We define “Total Senior Secured Debt” as our indebtedness secured on certain collateral assets,
which as of September 30, 2022, is the indebtedness under the Existing Notes and the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility.

    - We define “Net Debt” as Total Debt less cash and cash equivalents.

    - We define “Total Senior Secured Net Debt” as Total Senior Secured Debt less cash and cash
equivalents.

    - We define “Net Working Capital” as the sum of trade receivables, inventories and other current
assets less the sum of trade payables and other current liabilities.

    - We define “Other Operating Cash Flow” as cash flows relating to taxes, other miscellaneous
receivables and payables and cash payments related to costs included in Reported EBITDA (but not
Adjusted EBITDA).

    - We define “Free Cash Flow” as cash flows from operating activities less acquisitions of property,
plant and equipment and acquisitions of intangible assets;

    - We define “Adjusted **Free Cash Flow” as cash flows from operating activities less cash flows used**
in investing activities (comprising of acquisitions of property, plant and equipment, acquisitions of
intangible assets, disposal of property, plant and equipment and disposal of intangible assets).

    - We define “Net Interest Paid” as the sum of interest income (actually received in cash) and interest
paid (in cash) for the period.

    - We define “Change in Financial Debt” as the sum of net change in current financial liabilities, net
change in non-current financial liabilities and decrease in lease liabilities.

    - We define “Liquidity” as cash and cash equivalents plus amounts available for drawing under our
Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

**LTM Information**

This offering memorandum contains certain unaudited financial information of the Company for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2022 (the “LTM Information”), which has been calculated by adding our
results for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 (derived from the Unaudited Condensed Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements) to our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 (derived from the 2021
Financial Statements) and subtracting our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (derived from
the Unaudited Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements). As our financial year ends on December
31, the presentation of this data is not made in accordance with IFRS. We believe that the LTM Information is a
useful indicator of our ability to develop our business and operating cash flow and to serve our indebtedness and


-----

we present this data as it is the basis for certain ratios and _as adjusted_ financial information included in this
offering memorandum that we believe is useful as supplemental measures for investors in assessing the impact of
the Refinancing and our ability to incur and service our debt, including the Notes. This data is not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2022, and should not be used as
the basis for, or prediction of, an annualized calculation.

**_As Adjusted Financial Information_**

We present in this offering memorandum certain financial data for the Company as of and for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2022 as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Refinancing, as if it had occurred
on September 30, 2022 (in the case of balance sheet data), or October 1, 2021 (in the case of income statement
data). The as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent
what our actual cash and cash equivalents, total debt, net debt and cash interest expenses would have been had
the issuance of the Notes and the application of the net proceeds thereof occurred on September 30, 2022 (in the
case of balance sheet data), or October 1, 2021 (in the case of income statement data); nor does it purport to project
our net financial debt or net financial expenses at any future date. The as adjusted financial information has not
been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, the
Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the
adjustments nor the resulting adjusted financial information have been audited in accordance with any generally
accepted auditing standards.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial information presented
in millions or thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding adjustments
and, as a result, the totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic
totals of such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and
other information set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations” are calculated using the unrounded numerical data in the Consolidated Financial Statements or the_
tabular presentation of other information contained in this offering memorandum, as applicable, and not using the
numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

**PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

In this offering memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the various
markets or regions in which we operate and compete.

The offering memorandum includes industry and market data pertaining to the Issuer’s business and
markets. Such information is based on our analysis of multiple sources such as publicly available information,
industry publications and surveys, industry reports prepared by consultants, internal surveys and customer
feedback. The market, economic and industry data have primarily been derived and extrapolated from reports
provided by the National Joint Registry (“16th annual report 2019” (National Joint Registry for England, Wales,
_Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, 2019)) and Registro Italiano ArtroProtesi (“Rapporto ISS COVID-19 n._
_7/2021 Rev - Impatto dell’emergenza COVID-19 sui volumi di attività della chirurgia protesica ortopedica in_
_sette Regioni italiane” (Registro Italiano ArtroProtesi, March 31, 2021)), which we believe are useful to investors_
to assess the information relating to our industry, despite the inherent uncertainty of any market analysis and
industry data as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, certain statistics, data and other information relating to markets, market sizes, market shares,
market positions and other industry data pertaining to the Issuer’s business and markets in this offering
memorandum are not based on published data obtained from independent third parties or extrapolations therefrom,
but rather are based upon the Issuer’s analysis and best estimates, which are in turn based upon multiple third
party sources, including Orthoworld, GIA, Globaldata and services commissioned from a global management
consulting company.

Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has
been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that there can be no assurance as to the accuracy and
completeness of such information. We believe that these industry publications, surveys and forecasts are reliable,
but we have not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources. Forecasts and other
forward-looking information obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and uncertainties
as the other forward-looking statements in this offering memorandum.

We cannot assure you that any of the assumptions underlying any statements regarding the orthopedic
implant industry are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry. Market data and statistics are
inherently predictive and speculative and are not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics
are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers
and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the
relevant market. In addition, the value of comparisons of statistics for different markets is limited by many factors,
including that (i) the markets are defined differently, (ii) the underlying information was gathered by different
methods and (iii) different assumptions were applied in compiling the data. Accordingly, the market statistics
included in this offering memorandum should be viewed with caution and no representation or warranty is given
by any person, including the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers, as to their accuracy.

Elsewhere in this offering memorandum, statements regarding the orthopedic implant industry are not
based on published statistical data or information obtained from independent third-parties, but are based solely on
our experience, our internal studies and estimates, and our own investigation of market conditions at the time of
this offering memorandum. We cannot assure you that any of these studies or estimates are accurate, and none of
our internal surveys or information have been verified by any independent sources. Investors are urged to make
their investment decisions based on their own determination and analysis of market and industry data and not to
place undue reliance on the industry information presented in this offering memorandum. While we are not aware
of any misstatements regarding our estimates presented herein, our estimates involve risks, assumptions and
uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading
“Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum.

**ITALIAN “WHITE LIST STATES”**

In order to qualify as eligible to receive interest free from Italian Imposta Sostitutiva (Italian substitute
tax) under Decree 239/1996, inter alia, non-Italian resident holders of the Notes and beneficial interest therein
must be beneficial owners resident for tax purposes in, or “institutional investors” established in, a country which
the Italian government identifies as allowing for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy, as listed in the
Italian Ministerial Decree dated September 4, 1996, as amended from time to time, or, as from the tax year in
which the Ministerial Decree to be issued under Article 11, paragraph 4, let. c) of Decree 239/1996 is effective,
in a country therein included (the “White List”). See “Certain Italian Tax Considerations—Non-Italian Resident
_Noteholders.” Subject to certain limited exceptions, such as for central banks and supranational bodies established_
in accordance with international agreements in force in Italy, this residency requirement applies to all holders of
the Notes and beneficial interests therein, including ultimate beneficiaries of interest payments under the Notes
holding via sub-accounts to which interests in the Notes may be allocated upon purchase or thereafter. In the case

**RISK FACTORS**

_In addition to the other information contained in this offering memorandum, you should carefully_
_consider the following risk factors before purchasing the Notes. The risks and uncertainties we describe below_
_are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware or that we currently_
_believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of_
_operations. If any of the possible events described below were to occur, our business, prospects, financial_
_condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, we may not be_
_able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you could lose all or part of your investment._

_This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements_
_as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

**Risks Relating to Our Industry and Business**

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our business._**

The worldwide market for orthopedic implants is highly competitive in terms of pricing, product quality,
product innovation, time-to-market and customer service, among other factors. We face numerous competitors,
some of which are well-established operators in the global orthopedic devices market and might be better
positioned to respond more quickly to the industry's demands for technological innovation, undertake more
extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing or other resources or be more successful in
attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.

As we have a less comprehensive product range than certain of our peers, particularly with respect to
knee products and hip stems, we may not be able to keep up with our competitors’ access to surgeons and hospital
administrators and ability to absorb pricing pressures, which could result in losing some or all of our market share.
In particular, our less comprehensive product range than some of our competitors could limit our ability to be
competitive in certain sectors or markets compared to competitors who are able to offer a wider range of products
and benefit from significant synergies and cross-selling. These gaps in the product portfolio currently prevent us
from competing in certain segments within the orthopedic market. In addition to existing competition, we may
face competition from new entrants in the markets we target. For example, new start-ups capable of developing
new disruptive technologies could enter and/or create new markets in the digital applications business. These
factors, alone or in combination, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.

In addition, our competitors may develop products or technologies that will directly compete with our
devices and technology, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects. As a specialist manufacturer of orthopedic implants, it is important that we are at the forefront of
technological change. Our innovative technology and devices have attracted the interest of many companies in
the orthopedic implant industry. While several companies have unsuccessfully tried to replicate our technology,
including our distinctive Trabecular Titanium (“TT”) and 3D printing technologies, we cannot guarantee that
another company will not replicate or develop these technologies in the future. Further, because of how
technologically advanced our TT products are, we are able to charge a premium price for these implants, and if a
competitor were able to effectively compete with this technology at a lower price, this would affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, even if we were able to demonstrate superior
or equivalent results from our technology, practitioners may choose not to use our technology and we may suffer
a competitive disadvantage. Should another company be able to develop technologies that address the targeted
application for our current technology, this would affect our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects.

**_Our business may be negatively affected by changes in international economic conditions._**

Our business environment is influenced by conditions in the domestic and global economies. In times of
economic downturn, we could experience lower demand and a more challenging market environment for our
product offerings resulting from a general decline in consumer and business confidence, increased unemployment
and difficulties experienced by third party payors.

For instance, in addition to a general decline in demand, the strained budgets of many insurers and
national healthcare providers put pressure on these entities to contain healthcare costs and reimbursement rates.

55


-----

This may make it more difficult for patients to obtain funding and as a result they may have to modify, delay or
cancel any surgical plans that involve purchasing our products. Any of the foregoing factors may cause a decrease
in the number of products sold or a reduction in the average selling price we are able to charge for our products,
as well as an extension of payment terms.

Further, macroeconomic conditions may cause a deterioration in the creditworthiness of certain local or
regional public administrations and delays in the collection of trade receivables from national health care systems,
which would adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, or operating results.

Geopolitical tensions, including but not limited to tensions resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
in late February 2022 and tensions between China and the United States, could also negatively affect international
economic conditions. In addition, increases in inflation and expectations that annual inflation may remain high
for a long period of time (driven at least in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting impact on energy
markets) has forced central banks to accelerate the withdrawal of emergency monetary policies and liquidity
support measures put in place during the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As some of these measures
expire, are withdrawn or are no longer supported by governments, economic growth may be negatively impacted,
which in turn may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.

**_We face risks related to a pandemic, epidemic or other public health emergency, such as the recent outbreak_**
**_of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, which has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition, results of operations and prospects._**

Our operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics or other public health
emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic which has spread globally and impacted many countries, including
Italy and other countries in which we operate. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the implementation of
measures, on a global level by national governments and from time to time more restrictive, aimed at containing
the spread of COVID-19 that have led to limitations of our operations.

Hospitals globally have, to varying degrees, suspended and delayed elective surgeries in order to allocate
and direct medical supplies and capacity to the COVID-19 response. Some hospitals have also limited access to
their facilities or changed access protocols, which has made it difficult for us to support our surgeon customers.
The cumulative effect of a significant decrease of elective procedures at hospitals and the increase of their
spending supplies and infrastructure to expand system capacity related to COVID-19 had an impact on our
business in 2020 and in 2021, and it is not possible for us to accurately predict the length or severity of the
COVID-19 pandemic or the timing for a broad and sustained resumption of elective surgical procedures.

Consistent with national guidelines and with local orders, we continued to operate across our footprint.
Notwithstanding our continued operations, and any benefits we received from the economic measures adopted by
local governments, we have faced challenges in training and educating surgeons on our surgical techniques and
products due to travel restrictions and physical distancing requirements. These restrictions also impacted, albeit
to a limited extent, our manufacturing capabilities and distribution and warehousing operations. The COVID-19
pandemic has had and may have further negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks
and customers, which may lower our revenues, including as a result of the postponement and/or cancellation of
elective surgeries in impacted countries.

In addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic at certain regulatory bodies have prevented
new or modified products from being developed, cleared, approved, certified or commercialized in a timely
manner or at all. While regulatory authorities continue to adapt to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic by
monitoring and implementing changes to their inspection activities and designation processes to ensure the safety
of their employees and those of the firms they regulate, any future disruptions, like those brought about by the
COVID-19 pandemic, may impact their ability to timely review and process our regulatory submissions and
perform their audits, which in turn could negatively impact our business.

**_We may be unable to successfully implement our business and growth strategies._**

Our business strategy revolves around the following strategic pillars: (i) innovation and differentiation
of the product portfolio with a presence in high value-added sectors; (ii) advanced 3D printing technology with
proprietary TT technology and partnership with the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York; (iii) expansion of
the sales network in the fastest growing and highest margin areas with a focus on ASCs and private hospitals
through strategies tailored to individual countries and major channels; and (iv) targeted investment approach with
resource allocation in high value-added sectors and regions.

56


-----

Our performance and success largely depend on our ability to implement these business strategies. We
may not be able to successfully implement the business strategies described in this offering memorandum or those
otherwise developed by our business, including the penetration of new market segments, and these strategies may
not sustain or improve our results of operations in targeted sectors, or justify their costs. Any failure to develop,
revise or implement our business strategies in a timely and effective manner could have material adverse effects
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on third party suppliers for raw materials and supplies, and such parties’ failure to perform would_**
**_result in increased production costs._**

Our top five suppliers of raw materials and semi-finished products (excluding instrument sets) accounted
for 74.5% of our total costs of materials and raw materials for the year ended as of December 31, 2021, with our
top supplier accounting for approximately 23.3% of purchases. Should the availability and on-time delivery of
raw materials (particularly, titanium powder and ceramics) and supplies necessary for the production of our
products and services become unreliable or significantly more costly, then our reputation, relationship with
customers and earnings may be materially and adversely impacted. This would be due to the resulting increased
costs of production or our inability to supply products in a timely manner or at all.

The economic impact from the recent Russian military action in Ukraine has resulted in, and may
continue to result in, inflationary pressure in the months to come, affecting energy prices and global supply chains.
Though we have not yet experienced supply chain disruptions or material increases in our energy costs or in the
prices of our manufacturing materials, including those supplied by third-parties, there is a great deal of uncertainty
as to how inflationary increases in our manufacturing material costs, energy costs and supply chain disruptions
may develop, which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.

We also rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide instrument sets which we consign to hospitals
and surgeons to implant our products. In addition, we face risks associated with any supplier’s failure to adhere
to quality control and service guidelines or failure to ensure an adequate and timely supply of instrument sets for
our products. Any of these factors affecting our suppliers could negatively affect our business and financial
performance.

**_The existence of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement is important for the sales of our products;_**
**_cost-containment efforts, including more rigorous cost-benefit analyses by our customers, purchasing groups,_**
**_third-party payors and governmental organizations, as well as health care reform, could adversely affect_**
**_adoption of our products and our future revenue and profitability._**

Successful sales of our products depend, in part, on the availability of adequate coverage and
reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental payors, which are essential for achieving product
acceptance and widespread adoption in the marketplace. Since our products or procedures using our products are
typically covered by public insurance and other government healthcare programs in Italy and other countries, our
business is impacted by cost-containment efforts by governments in particular and other third-party payors and
customers more generally. For instance, in the United States, prices for orthopedic implants are largely influenced
by government and private insurance reimbursement programs.

In all the main markets in which we operate, and irrespective of the type of third party payor involved
(which differs from country to country), initiatives promoted by government agencies, legislative bodies and the
private sector to control healthcare costs are underway. These include price regulation, excise duties and price
competition, with the aim of containing the cost of healthcare spending, and which limit both the coverage and
the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products, including ours. As a result, obtaining coverage and
reimbursement approval of a product or procedures using such product from a government or other third-party
payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us or our partners to provide to each payor
scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data supporting the use of our products on a payor-by-payor basis, with
no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Further, as a result of such initiatives,
patients have begun to pay more out of their own pockets, which results in patients more closely scrutinizing the
products to decide whether the products are worth the money. In addition, in most countries in which we operate,
the reimbursement of costs to private and public hospitals is based on predetermined specific rates for each
diagnosis related group (DRG) based on diagnoses, procedures, age, sex, discharge status, and the presence of
complications or comorbidities. Any changes in the way national healthcare systems reimburse the cost of our
products, including, in particular and changes in the current structure of the healthcare system in Italy (our largest
single market by revenue), could result in reduced demand or prices for our products, with negative effects on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

57


-----

**_We derive a substantial portion of our business from the award of public contracts, which requires frequent_**
**_participation in competitive, highly regulated public tender offer processes, often limit our ability to negotiate_**
**_pricing and other terms and make us subject to changes in public spending policies._**

We participate in public tenders for contracts with public institutions, including governments and
regional and local institutions. Public tender laws generally require that contracts with public institutions for the
supply of products such as ours be put to competitive tender upon expiration, and automatic renewal clauses are
prohibited. As a result, we must constantly win new contracts to defend our market share and sustain growth and
such new contracts may be subject to competitive bidding.

Any such new contracts may also themselves be subject to competitive bidding, which is often limited
to those companies that can supply comprehensive product portfolios with availability of every device within a
certain category. The requirements for these public tender processes are subject to change and there can be no
assurance that we will be able to continue to fulfil the requirements to participate in these. As part of some tenders,
we may be required to provide bank and insurance guarantees (including sureties, advance payments or
independent guarantee contracts), which we may not be able to obtain. The failure to obtain such contracts–even
if due to errors made by our own employees and/or to cases of corporate infidelity–could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, national, regional and local level governments have increasingly relied upon multi-year
contracts with pre-established terms and conditions, which, in turn, may require us to make sustained efforts to
reduce costs in order to realize profits under such contracts. If we are not successful in reducing the amount of
costs we incur, our profitability on contracts with public institutions will be negatively impacted. In addition, in
the event we fail to provide the specific devices awarded under a tenders, we could be excluded from future
tenders.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, many existing and potential customers in the private sector
for our products have become members of group purchase organizations, integrated delivery networks and other
centralized purchasing agencies (collectively, the “Group Purchase Organizations” or “GPOs”) in an effort to
reduce costs. Group Purchase Organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with orthopedic product
manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. Group
Purchase Organizations typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding
process. Bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers with the intention of driving down pricing, with
the possible consequence of reducing the market prices of our products as well as our profitability.

We may therefore spend significant time and incur significant costs in order to prepare bids or proposals,
or participate in the relevant bidding process with Group Purchase Organizations, at the end of which we may not
be retained. As a result, due to the highly competitive nature of the contracting processes for Group Purchase
Organizations, we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major Group Purchase
Organizations across our product portfolio.

While having a contract with a Group Purchase Organization for a given product category can facilitate
sales to members of that Group Purchase Organization, such contract positions can offer no assurance that sales
volumes of those products will be maintained. Group Purchase Organizations may award contracts to multiple
suppliers for the same product line and members of the Group Purchase Organization generally are free to
purchase from other suppliers. Furthermore, contracts with Group Purchase Organizations typically are terminable
without cause upon limited notice and they may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or
quality offered by such competitors, which could result in a decline in our sales and profitability.

Moreover, the Italian healthcare regulations, as recently supplemented, provide that a yearly budget to
purchase medical devices is assigned to each Italian region and, in case such yearly budget is exceeded, each
region shall ask for a reimbursement to the medical devices suppliers for a portion of the excess amount, and in
proportion to the annual market share of each supplier in the relevant region (the “Payback Mechanism”). In
particular, pursuant to Law Decree No. 115 of August 9, 2022 (as converted into Law No. 142/2022), the Italian
Ministry of Health determined the amounts in excess of the regional budgets for each of the years 2015, 2016,
2017 and 2018 in its Decree published on September 15, 2022 (the “Decree 216/2022”) and provided the
guidelines that the Italian regions shall apply when asking for reimbursements under the Payback Mechanism
with a Ministerial Decree published on October 6, 2022 (the “Decree 251/2022”). Pursuant to such mechanism,
each region shall issue payment orders to the medical device suppliers by mid-December 2022. Should a supplier
not pay the requested amounts in 30 days, Decree 216/2022 provides that such amounts are offset against any
outstanding credits such suppliers towards each region and/or the entities affiliated to the regional healthcare

58


-----

system (the “Offset Mechanism”). With Law Decree No. 4 of January 11, 2023, the deadline for the payment of
all the amounts required under the Payback Mechanism has been postponed until April 30, 2023.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have received payment orders pursuant to the Payback
Mechanism from the regions of Lombardy, Sardinia, Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Piedmont, Apulia, Marche,
Tuscany, Umbria, Sicily, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Liguria, as well as from the Autonomous Provinces of Trento
and Bolzano, for claimed reimbursement amounts collectively totaling €8.8 million and covering the years 2015,
2016, 2017 and 2018. In addition, we have received certain communications of process commencement from
other Italian regions in relation to the years 2015 through 2018, but with no indication of any potential future
amount of payment request.

In line with the approach of other medical device companies, we timely challenged Decree 216/2022 and
Decree 251/2022 before the Regional Administrative Court of the Lazio Region, challenging (among other items)
the constitutionality of Decree 216/2022 and Decree 251/2022. We also intend to challenge the above-mentioned
payment orders received to date and any further resolution issued by any relevant authority under the Payback
Mechanism, also arguing that such challenges in court make it unlawful for the regions and/or the entities affiliated
to the Regional Healthcare System to use the Offset Mechanism. On December 12, 2022, the region of Sardinia
suspended its resolution No. 1356 of November 28, 2022, whereby it had determined the specific amounts due by
each medical device supplier pursuant to Decree 216/2022 and according to the guidelines provided with Decree
251/2022, until the appeals brought before the Administrative Court for Lazio (TAR Lazio) by numerous medical
device suppliers (including us) against Decree 216/2022 and Decree 251/2022 are decided.

However, as of the date of this offering memorandum, we cannot exclude the possibility that we will
receive other payment orders under the Payback Mechanism, including by other Italian regions and/or concerning
any interest accrued on the amounts that we have been required to pay under the Payback Mechanism for each of
2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. We also cannot predict the amounts of any related potential future requests.
Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Italian Ministry of Health will determine that the regional
budgets for each of the years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 have been exceeded and, if so, whether the Italian regions
will issue further payment orders to us with respect to each of such years, nor can we make a specific assessment
on the amounts of the related potential requests (if any) at this stage, since no decree outlining the criteria to
quantify liability amounts due by medical devices suppliers under the Payback Mechanism exists with respect to
any of these years. In the future, we may determine (in accordance with applicable accounting principles) that the
potential liabilities under such payment orders warrant the provision of special reserves in our balance sheet
relating to the Payback Mechanism, though the scope and calculation of such liability is uncertain as of the date
of this offering memorandum.

**_Orthopedic products such as ours are in many jurisdictions subject to price erosion relating to product_**
**_commoditization._**

The orthopedic implant industry has been traditionally characterized by price erosion, and consequent
reduction of profitability, after a product has been on the market for an extended period of time. In addition, this
contraction may also occur as devices move into ASCs and as the demand for additional technologies to be offered
free of charge increases. One of the results of the rapid innovation in the orthopedic implant industry is that pricing
pressure, especially on products containing older technology (and, therefore, subject to commoditization), can be
intense. In order to profitably supply these products, we must reduce our production costs in line with the lower
net sales price we can expect to receive per unit. Usually, this is accomplished through improvements in process
technology and production efficiencies.

We may not be able to cease production of unprofitable products, either due to contractual obligations
or for customer relationship reasons, and as a result, we may incur losses on such products. While the extremities
segment has held better pricing for longer, this segment could also experience price erosion. In addition, new,
premium products may not sustain premium pricing as the product becomes standardized over time, thereby
negatively impacting our margins and profitability.

If we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our efficiencies to a degree sufficient to
maintain required margins, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.

59

**_We rely on certifications by industry standards-setting bodies._**

In most of the countries where we operate, we are required to obtain certain mandatory certifications and
comply with professional licensing requirements. In addition, some of our customers have required us to obtain
one or more internationally-recognized certifications for our activities, or we do on a voluntary basis because the
terms of public tenders confer advantages on bidders who are so certified. We incur significant costs and expenses,
including any necessary upgrades to our equipment and fixed assets, associated with maintaining these
certifications. If we fail to maintain any of our certifications, our business may be harmed because our customers
that require them may cease contracting our products which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We continue to assess the potential impact of such developments in the healthcare regulatory
environment, as there is no certainty that they will not adversely affect our business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.

**_Legislative or regulatory reforms may have a material adverse effect on us._**

From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced that could significantly change the statutory
provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may
change their marketing authorization or certification procedures and policies, adopt additional regulations or
revise existing regulations or take other actions, which may prevent or delay the receipt of marketing
authorizations or certifications for our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently
cleared or certified products on a timely basis. Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its
510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer
review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their
products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to
modernize the 510(k) premarket notification pathway. Among other things, the FDA announced that it plans to
develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These
proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k)
clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated
substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old.

In September 2019, the FDA also issued revised final guidance establishing a “Safety and Performance
Based Pathway” for “manufacturers of certain well-understood device types” allowing manufacturers to rely on
objective safety and performance criteria recognized by the FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence,
obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific
predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains a list of device types appropriate
for the “safety and performance based” pathway and will continue to develop product-specific guidance
documents that identify the performance criteria and recommended testing methodologies for each such device
type, where feasible. The FDA may establish performance criteria for classes of devices for which we or our
competitors seek or currently have received clearance, and it is unclear the extent to which such performance
standards, if established, could impact our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances or otherwise create competition
that may negatively affect our business.

In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that
may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or
reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future
products or make it more difficult to obtain clearance or approval for, manufacture, market or distribute our
products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when
and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other
things, require additional testing before obtaining clearance or approval; changes to manufacturing methods;
recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products; or additional record keeping. If we are slow or unable to
adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to
maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action, and we may not achieve or sustain
profitability.

In addition, the landscape concerning medical devices in the EU recently evolved. On May 25, 2017, the
EU Medical Devices Regulation (“EU Medical Devices Regulation”) entered into force, which repeals and
replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike
directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, regulations are directly
applicable (i.e., without the need for implementation into national law) in all EU member states and are intended

60


-----

to eliminate current differences in the regulatory requirements on medical devices among EU member states. The
EU Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable
and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and
health while supporting innovation.

The EU Medical Devices Regulation became applicable on May 26, 2021. The new regulation among
other things:

      - strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market (e.g. reclassification of certain devices
and wider scope than the EU Medical Devices Directive) and reinforces surveillance once they
are available;

      - establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow up of the
quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;

      - establishes explicit provisions on importers’ and distributors’ obligations and responsibilities;

      - imposes an obligation to identify a responsible person who is ultimately responsible for all
aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new regulation;

      - improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end user or
patient through the introduction of a unique identification number, to increase the ability of
manufacturers and regulatory authorities to trace specific devices through the supply chain and
to facilitate the prompt and efficient recall of medical devices that have been found to present a
safety risk;

      - sets up a central database (Eudamed) to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public
with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and

      - strengthens the rules for the assessment of certain high risk devices, such as implants, which
may have to undergo a clinical evaluation consultation procedure by experts before they are
placed on the market.

These modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to develop our business in the EU and the
European Economic Area (“EEA”) (which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and
Iceland). For example, as a result of the transition towards the new regime, notified body review times have
lengthened, and product introductions could be delayed or canceled, which could adversely affect our ability to
grow our business.

The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”) came into effect on January 1, 2021. The TCA
does not specifically refer to medical devices. However, as a result of Brexit, the EU Medical Devices Regulation
will not be implemented in the UK, and previous legislation that mirrored the EU Medical Devices Regulation in
the UK law has been revoked. The regulatory regime for medical devices in Great Britain (England, Scotland and
Wales) will continue to be based on the requirements derived from current EU legislation, and the UK may choose
to retain regulatory flexibility or align with the EU Medical Devices Regulation going forward. CE markings will
continue to be recognized in the UK, and certificates issued by EU-recognized notified bodies will be valid in the
UK, until June 30, 2023. For medical devices placed on the market in Great Britain after this period, the UKCA,
marking will be mandatory. In contrast, UKCA marking and certificates issued by UK notified bodies will not be
recognized on the EU market. The TCA does provide for cooperation and exchange of information in the area of
product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures,
standardization related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls (or other similar actions).
For medical devices that are locally manufactured but use components from other countries, the “rules of origin”
criteria will need to be reviewed. Depending on which countries products will be ultimately sold in, manufacturers
may start seeking alternative sources for components if this would allow them to benefit from no tariffs. The rules
for placing medical devices on the Northern Ireland market will differ from those in Great Britain. On June 26,
2022, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) published its long-awaited
response to its consultation on the UK’s post-Brexit regulatory regime for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic
medical devices. The MHRA confirmed that the new regulatory landscape will mirror many of the provisions of
the EU regulatory regime, as contained within the EU Medical Devices Regulation. However, the response also
highlighted that in certain areas, medical devices regulation in Great Britain is likely to deviate from the EU
framework. The UK government now needs to translate its proposals into legislation, via amendments to the UK

61


-----

Medical Devices Regulations (SI 2002 No 618, as amended). These modifications may have an effect on the way
we intend to conduct our business in these countries.

**_We are subject to potential product liability risks, which are inherent in the design, marketing and sale of_**
**_orthopedic implants and surgical instrumentation._**

Our products are used in medical procedures and, therefore, they must function with precision and
accuracy. In case of product malfunctioning, defects or error in design, we may have to withdraw such products
from the market whether by choice or due to a regulatory order from local authorities, which could expose us to
product liability. In addition, in some jurisdictions in which we may choose to commercialize our products, we
may be subject to strict liability with respect to defects in our products, such that we would be liable for damages
even without a demonstration by the plaintiff of negligence or culpability on our part.

We cannot provide assurance we will not face product liability claims that result in substantial liability
for which we might not be fully insured. A large, successful claim against us, for which we are partially or
completely uninsured, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the cost of
defending such a claim, together with the costs associated with any payment of damages. Even if a product liability
claim is meritless, otherwise unsuccessful or not in excess of our insurance coverage limits, our cash available for
other purposes, such as R&D, could be adversely affected, causing a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, under consumer product legislation in many countries, we may be forced to recall or
repurchase defective products and more restrictive laws and regulations relating to these matters may be adopted
in the future. Negative publicity surrounding our products, caused by product defects, recalls, regulatory
investigations, legal proceedings or other events, could also have a negative impact on how our products are
perceived in the healthcare industry. Any forced recall or repurchase of our defective products could have a
material adverse effect on our reputation which could in turn lead to decreased demand for our products, sales and
cash flows. Our business is also sensitive to any changes in tort and product liability laws.

**_We do not have long-term contracts with our customers and we must effectively demonstrate to surgeons,_**
**_hospitals and other healthcare providers that our orthopedic products are an attractive alternative to our_**
**_competitors’ products._**

Most of our relationships with surgeons, who have traditionally been the decision-makers regarding the
purchasing of our products, are not contractually based (and even when they are, there is generally no provision
for the purchase of minimum quantities and the customer may withdraw at any time with no restrictions), and this
exposes us to the risk that customers can discontinue use of our products at any time. Surgeons play a significant
role in determining the course of treatment and, ultimately, the type of product that will be used to treat a patient.
Hospitals and other healthcare providers, such as outpatient surgical clinics are increasingly involved in the
evaluation of products and product purchasing decisions as well. Some of our most important customers are public
entities (including hospitals) which, operating through government-sponsored healthcare programs, are
traditionally subject to increasing pressures in terms of reducing or controlling spending. These customers
accounted for 38.5%, 26.7% and 36.1% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021,
respectively. Therefore, given that the size and purchasing power of these parties allow them to obtain
commercially advantageous conditions, it cannot be excluded that, in the event of renewal of the related contracts,
we will be in the position of having to accept less favorable conditions than those currently negotiated.

By reason of the absence of contractual regulation of the relationships with healthcare professionals and
the various counterparties involved in the process, there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain these
relationships in the future, selling our products to existing clients or selling them at the conditions applied as of
the date of this offering memorandum.

We establish relationships with surgeons and other medical professionals through providing instrument
sets and the necessary training to use our implants. We also conduct trainings and provide instrument sets to
medical schools, where we teach medical students how to use our instruments and implants, which helps facilitate
relationships with new surgeons and strengthens relationships with medical school professionals. The COVID-19
pandemic has impacted our ability to conduct such trainings. While changing suppliers of orthopedic products
could be labor-intensive and costly for many of our customers, our customers are not contractually committed to
purchase any minimum quantity nor are they prohibited from terminating their relationships with us. Any loss of
key contracts or accounts could require us to change our current operational structure and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

62


-----

**_We devote substantial resources to R&D, which requires us to make relatively high amounts of capital_**
**_investments that provide no guarantee of success._**

We have historically made high amounts of capital investments, including R&D and capital expenditures.
We devote substantial resources to R&D, but cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in developing
profitable new products or improving existing products so that our products remain competitive and avoid
obsolescence. In addition, whether successful or not, our R&D costs are significant and could have a material
adverse effect on our business if we are unsuccessful in developing and producing competitive products that
achieve market acceptance or the products do not perform as expected.

In particular, we invest substantial resources into innovating our manufacturing capabilities, designing
differentiated instrument sets and maintaining quality control systems in a highly regulated industry. There can
be no assurance that our investments in these areas will result in increased profitability or that we will be able to
maintain adequate levels of working capital or have funds available for future borrowing under our Revolving
Credit Facility in order to compete and innovate, as well to as meet our business’s other needs, which would have
a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, in the orthopedic implant industry, it is critical that a manufacturer provide surgeons and
hospitals with a set of instruments that enables the surgeon to implant the orthopedic product. We are required to
maintain significant inventory of instrument sets for consignment to our customers. These instrument sets are
designed specifically for use with our products, and a surgeon generally cannot use another manufacturer’s
instrument sets for a different implant. Instrument sets are provided free of charge to hospitals and surgeons, and
typically last about 5 years before their components need to be replaced. In the event that a portion of our inventory
becomes obsolete, the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to
replace such inventory could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. Concerns raised by
regulators relating to our instrument sets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospect.

As we continue to grow globally, our investments in instrument sets must increase in order to reach the
new customers who buy our products. In addition, as we introduce new products, new implant and instrument sets
may be required, which may result in a significant initial investment in order to support the launch of a product.
Our Capital Expenditures related to instrument sets are significant and there is no guarantee that the costs we incur
in designing and ordering new instrument sets will be repaid or covered by future sales. If we incur substantial
costs in providing and maintaining more instrument sets and ultimately do not see a return on our investment in
these instrument sets, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_Our success is partially dependent upon our ability to successfully market new and improved products and the_**
**_failure of the market to accept our new or improved products, or our failure to successfully market these_**
**_products would adversely impact our revenues and cash flows in turn having a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

The success of selling our products depends upon our ability to effectively market our innovative and
high quality products to our customers. Future acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of
factors including, among others: (i) ease of use of our products; (ii) the efficacy and potential advantages relative
to competing products and products under development; (iii) coverage and reimbursement of procedures using
our products by third-party payors; and (iv) the price for our products and competing products. We cannot provide
assurance that our products will gain market acceptance. The failure of our products to gain market acceptance
would likely have a material adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows, which would ultimately materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, the industry in which we operate is subject to increasingly rapid technological changes and
technological innovation will drive product growth. Therefore, our future success depends on our ability to keep
pace with new technological advances that could make our products less competitive or obsolete. Our customers,
competitors and other businesses might develop technologies that are more effective or commercially attractive
than our current or future technologies, or that render our technologies less competitive or potentially obsolete. If
competitors introduce superior technologies and we cannot procure or develop these technologies, or enhance
ours in a timely manner to remain competitive, our competitive position, and in turn our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected.

**_We may be unable to maintain positive working relationships with healthcare professionals, such as surgeons,_**
**_healthcare providers and medical school professionals._**

In the orthopedic implant industry, surgeons typically play a key role in the decision-making process.
Surgeons are generally driven by device safety and clinical results (particularly, surgical success and implant
failure rate), ease of use and associated support, customizable products and innovations, familiarization with the
product through early training at medical school or residency and the price of the product. Over the years, the
primary decision-making responsibility has begun to shift more towards hospital administrators due to cost
containment pressures, but surgeons still play a very important role in choosing the orthopedic implant or
influencing the purchasing decision.

We also rely on healthcare professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of our
implants. We seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in
hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development and in the training of surgeons on the
safe and effective use of our products. If we are unable to maintain long-lasting working relationships with
healthcare professionals, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could be adversely
affected and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are exposed to currency exchange and translation risks, which may reduce our operating results._**

As of the date of this offering memorandum we operate directly in Italy (where two of our three
production facilities are located), as well as indirectly through 26 subsidiaries in countries around the world and
sell our products into approximately 51 countries. See “Our Business—Overview.” Factors affecting exchange
rates are beyond our control and include trade balances, levels of short-term interest rates, differences in relative
values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation,
and political developments.

Although our reporting currency is the euro, only 49.4% of our revenue was generated in euro, and 50.6%
of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than euro for the year ended December 31, 2021, in particular
U.S. dollar (16.6%), Japanese yen (5.8%), Australian dollar (5.8%) and pound sterling (5.3%). In addition, a
substantial portion of our fixed costs, especially salary and remuneration, are denominated in euro. Unlike our
sales, a substantial portion of our costs, including raw material costs, are denominated in euro. In particular, more
than half of our employees are based in Italy, and their salaries are paid in euro. As of the date of this offering
memorandum we do not have any currency hedging agreements in place. As a result, our business, financial
condition and results of operations are exposed to risks related to currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in
exchange rates may also affect the relative competitive position of our manufacturing facilities, as well as our
ability to market our products successfully in other markets.

Since the functional currency of a number of our subsidiaries is not the euro, the results of such
subsidiaries are translated into euro at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our financial statements.
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate at the end of the relevant reporting period, and income
and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period (as applicable). Therefore, fluctuations in
the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and pound sterling in any given
period could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_If we are unable to maintain and expand our network of direct and independent sales representatives, we may_**
**_not be able to generate anticipated sales._**

We sell our products primarily through a combination of direct and indirect sales personnel. If our sales
representatives and sales agents fail to adequately promote, market and sell our products, or fail to develop strong
relationships with customers, our sales could significantly decrease or fail to increase. Further, the termination or
transition of a sales representative could disrupt business and cause us to incur expenses related to such
termination or transition, including contract termination fees or expenses associated with claims and lawsuits.
Asserting or defending against these types of claims and lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses,
and if we are unsuccessful, we could be liable for damages.

**_We may become involved in material litigation and arbitration proceedings._**

We may become involved in material litigation and arbitration proceedings, such as labor related
litigation, tax audits, intellectual property litigation or litigation or arbitration with our customers, suppliers or
partners, as well as legal proceedings relating to product liability. As of December 31, 2021, we have set up a
provision for risks and charges equal to €3.9 million in our financial statements, in order to cover liabilities that

64


-----

may arise from any administrative, judicial or arbitration proceedings. Moreover, in the ordinary course of
business, we are party to various legal proceedings relating to product liability in which the amount in controversy
is rarely quantified and its actual determination is usually left to the judge’s assessment. Given the uncertain nature
of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result
from an unfavorable outcome. Even if we were successful in defending such proceedings, we would still suffer
from the distraction of management resources dedicated to such proceedings, incur certain expenses and possibly
face harm to our reputation from case-related publicity. The involvement in litigation and arbitration proceedings
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, public tenders we win from public institutions may be challenged by third party competitors,
and the resultant litigation in administrative courts could be protracted and cause delay to our projects and may
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our training methods may not be successful or may be deemed not to comply with applicable regulations and_**
**_surgeons may not effectively train other surgeons or recommend our products to the broader medical_**
**_community, which could have a negative impact on our business._**

Trainings are vital to a surgeon’s ability to implant the orthopedic product correctly, and surgeons and
the rest of the operational staff normally require in-servicing assistance to use the instruments and implant the
product as different products require different instrument sets. If surgeons and the team are not properly trained,
they may misuse or ineffectively use our products. This may result in, among other consequences, unsatisfactory
patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could have an adverse
effect on our business and market acceptance of our products.

Following completion of our training courses for surgeons, we rely on the trained surgeons not only to
continue to use our products, but also to train and mentor future surgeons who use our products as well as advocate
the benefits of our products among the broader medical community. Even after successfully completing the
training program, surgeons could experience difficulty using our products and cease using them or significantly
limit their use in practice.

Apart from risks relating to the potential ineffectiveness of our training, we face risks relating to
applicable regulation. In particular, our relationships with surgeons, purchasers, third-party payors and patients
will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which
could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished
profits and future earnings, as well as constrain our business arrangements and relationships through which we
market, sell and distribute certain of our products. See “—We are subject to certain federal, state and foreign
_fraud and abuse laws, which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to_
_or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to defend, and_
_thus could harm our business.” If any regulatory authority were to determine that our training constituted_
promotion of an off-label or unapproved use, or did not comply with applicable laws and regulations (including
anti-kickback and bribery laws), it could request that we modify our training or subject us to regulatory
enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, fine or criminal penalty. The
occurrence of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.

**_We may not be able to secure and maintain adequate levels of product liability insurance coverage on_**
**_acceptable terms, or at all._**

Product liability insurance premiums are volatile. If premiums increase significantly, then our operating
costs would increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. We presently
carry product liability insurance with coverage in an amount we consider reasonable and customary. However,
this insurance coverage includes various deductibles, limitations and exclusions from coverage, and may not fully
cover all potential claims. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance in the future at an acceptable cost, or
at all, which could result in our need to self-insure and otherwise have an adverse effect on our liquidity in turn
impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We need to attract and retain strong executives and other personnel and we are dependent on highly qualified_**
**_and sophisticated R&D personnel to succeed with our product development initiatives._**

Our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends, in part, on the continued
contributions of our directors, senior management, engineers, medically trained sales personnel and other R&D

65


-----

personnel, as well as our sales and public tenders team. In general, the recruitment of personnel with degrees in
mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, materials science and physics, and others in the field of
orthopedics is highly competitive due to a scarcity of people with the appropriate training and experience. In
addition, our future growth and success also depend on our ability to attract, recruit, develop and retain skilled
managerial, sales, administration, operating and technical personnel.

There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite competencies to serve in these positions
and we cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ such qualified personnel on terms acceptable
to us or at all. Moreover some of our competitors are larger and have greater brand recognition. Therefore, the
unplanned loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain additional key personnel
(including directors, key managers, researchers and/or developers), could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are exposed to risks related to conducting operations in multiple countries._**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we operate three manufacturing facilities and 26 subsidiaries
around the world. Because of the international scope of our activities, we are subject to a number of risks and
challenges, many of which are beyond our control. These include, among other things, political, social and
economic instability, or corruption; inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in government policies and
regulations or difficulty in securing necessary regulatory approvals; difficulties in enforcing intellectual property
rights; increases in transportation and other shipping costs; devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange
rates; uncertainties in and the revocation of property titles; tariffs and other trade protection measures; the inability
to collect payments or longer payment cycles; restrictions on the ability to own or operate foreign subsidiaries;
restrictions on the ability to repatriate dividends from subsidiaries; and the imposition or increases of price controls
or withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, structuring
decisions and local legal compliance may be more difficult due to conflicting laws and regulations, including
those relating to, among other things, employment, health and safety, public procurement, competition, taxation
and environmental protection.

Our international sales are also subject to the laws and the regulations of various jurisdictions relating to
economic sanctions, export control and anti-corruption, which increase the risk that we may become subject to
significant penalties for violating such laws, which may result in a curtailment of our existing business in such
countries and in amendments to our policies. As a globally operating organization, we conduct and/or have
conducted in the past de minimis business with customers in countries such as Iran, Russia and Ukraine that are
subject to export control regulations, embargoes, economic sanctions or other forms of trade restrictions. Although
medical products are not usually subject to embargo policies, new or expanded export control regulations,
embargoes, economic sanctions or other forms of trade restrictions may result in a curtailment of our existing
business in such countries. Failure to comply with these laws could expose us to civil and criminal prosecution
and penalties, the imposition of export or economic sanctions against us and reputational damage. Any of these
factors could require us to change our current operational structure and could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Some of the information in this offering memorandum about our industry, market share and relative_**
**_competitive position is from third-party sources that we have not independently verified or is based on our_**
**_assumptions or estimates, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate, and therefore such information may_**
**_incorrectly reflect our market position._**

This offering memorandum contains information about our industry, including historical market share data
and industry forecasts. We have generally obtained these data from publicly available information, internal
estimates and third-party sources (including data analysis (commissioned by us) from a global management
consulting company and other published independent sources). We believe that such sources are reliable;
however, we have not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources nor have we ascertained the
underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. Industry forecasts are by their nature subject to significant
uncertainty and there can be no assurances that they will prove to be accurate.

Market opportunity estimates (including anticipated COVID-19 backlog data) and growth projections
included in this offering memorandum, including those we have generated ourselves and those elaborated by third
parties, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to
be accurate, including the risks described herein. Even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted
growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. The variables that go into the calculation of
projected growth of our key markets, industry and our own market opportunity are subject to change over time

66


-----

(including unpredicted factors, such as it occurred with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic). Therefore,
any market growth and expansion in our markets depend on a number of factors, including the cost, performance,
and perceived value associated with our products and the products provided by our competitors. Even if the market
in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasted included in our offering memorandum, our
business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success
in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the forecasts
of market growth included in our offering memorandum should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.

This offering memorandum also contains statements regarding our relative competitive position in the
industry that are not directly based on published statistical data or information obtained from independent third
parties, but are based on our experience and our own investigation of market conditions, including our own
elaborations of published statistical or third-party data. Our estimates are based on information obtained from a
variety of sources, including our customers, sales forces, trade and business organizations, market consultants,
that we believe to be reliable; however, we cannot assure you that such information is accurate or that our estimates
based on such information are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry. None of our internal
surveys or information has been verified by independent sources.

**_Our sales agents may bring claims to be re-characterized as employees._**

As of December 31, 2021, in the United States where we operate through a network of sales agents, we
had 44 agents contracting with 150 sales representatives. Although they are correctly classified as agents and have
their own autonomy, these individuals could consider that they should be re-characterized as employees and
request us to extend to them employee benefits. If such claims were to be brought and be successful, our personnel
expenses could increase significantly. There can be no assurance, however, that there will not be future claims for
re-characterization that would have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We may make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources or which could face_**
**_difficulties and unforeseen liabilities._**

In the future, we may decide to make additional acquisitions in addition to those made in the past
including, in particular: (i) the acquisition from Zimmer Biomet of two product lines related to knee prostheses
and one product line related to elbow prostheses, which closed in 2015; and (ii) the acquisition, between 2018 and
2021 through our subsidiary Lima USA, of the entire share capital of TechMah.

Successful growth through future acquisitions is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable
acquisition targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately
complete such transactions and integrate the acquired business into our Group. Such activities expose us to a
number of risks. For example, there may be liabilities or asset impairments that we fail, or are unable, to discover
in the course of performing acquisition-related due diligence investigations. Furthermore, even for obligations
and liabilities that we do discover during the due diligence process, neither the valuation adjustment nor the
contractual protections we negotiate may be sufficient to fully protect us from losses. If we make acquisitions, we
may not be able to generate expected margins or cash flows, or to realize the anticipated benefits of such
acquisitions, including growth or expected synergies. In addition, the acquisition agreements we have already in
place or that we may enter into in the future contain or may contain deferred consideration, which may impact
our financial condition and future operating results. For example, our agreement with MT Ortho for our purchase
of a branch of business operating as a going concern provides for us to make certain deferred payments depending
on the revenues generated by certain MT Ortho products included in the acquisition.

Our assessments of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets may prove to be incorrect, and actual
developments may differ significantly from our expectations. We may also incur unforeseeable and unexpected
liabilities or contingencies relating to customers, employees, suppliers or other parties, which could affect our
results of operations and financial condition. It could also be more costly or not possible to successfully integrate
the companies subject to acquisition or integration, both in terms of internal functions and production processes,
and we may therefore be exposed to financial and operational risks and uncertainties, with possible adverse effects
on our activities and prospects as well as on our economic and financial condition.

**_We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated IT processes and a failure in our IT systems, or our inability_**
**_to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our IT systems, could adversely affect our business._**

We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for the development and
production of our products and operational and reporting infrastructure. The operation of our production plants
and the transfer of data between our subsidiaries, distribution and service partners and financial institutions depend
on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our IT system, which requires significant resources to maintain,
protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems. Further, IT systems are generally susceptible to
disruptions, damage, power failure, computer viruses, hacking attempts by third-parties, fire and other events.
Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of our IT systems could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have implemented certain measures to protect ourselves
against such events; however, operational breakdowns or interruptions of these systems may still occur and any
such event could impair our ability to maintain our efficient production and supply processes and guarantee
sufficient quality controls. As our manufacturing processes rely on a high level of automation, IT system
breakdowns or interruptions could also lead to production stoppage, which in turn could result in lower revenue
and unexpected costs. If one or more of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic_**
**_conditions and financial markets, which could adversely affect us._**

We have operations in multiple countries, including the UK. Following a national referendum and
enactment of legislation by the government of the UK, the UK formally withdrew from the EU and ratified a trade
and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the EU. Because the agreement merely sets forth
a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the UK and the
EU as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty
remains about the precise terms of the future relationship between the parties.

This uncertainty has had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic
conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Lack of clarity about future UK laws and regulations as
the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate, could increase costs, disrupt supply chains, depress
economic activity and restrict our access to capital.

Brexit could also result in the UK significantly altering its regulations affecting the certification of
medical devices, which will result in additional costs and increased uncertainty as to any new conformity
assessment procedures. Any adjustments we make to our business and operations as a result of Brexit and related
regulatory changes could result in significant expense and take significant time to complete.

Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_A deterioration in our relationships with our employees or trade unions or a failure to extend, renew or_**
**_renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could have an adverse impact on our_**
**_business._**

Maintaining good relationships with our employees, unions and other employee representatives is crucial
to our operations. As a result, any deterioration of the relationships with our employees, unions and other
employee representatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects. See “Our _Business—Employees.”_

As of September 30, 2022, approximately 63% of our employees are located in Italy and are covered by
national collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically complement applicable statutory
provisions in respect of, among other things, the general working conditions of our employees, such as maximum
working hours, holidays, termination, retirement, welfare and incentives. National collective bargaining
agreements and company-specific agreements also contain provisions that could affect our ability to restructure
our operations and facilities or terminate employees. We may not be able to renew company-specific agreements
on their current terms or, upon the expiration of such agreements, negotiate such agreements in a favorable and
timely manner or without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. We may also become subject to
additional company-specific agreements or amendments to existing national collective bargaining agreements.

68


-----

Such additional company-specific agreements or amendments may increase our operating costs and have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Additionally, strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes could disrupt our operations, result in a loss
of reputation, increased wages and benefits, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**Risks Relating to Intellectual Property**

**_Litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to_**
**_spend significant time and money to defend ourselves and could prevent us from selling our implant systems._**

Our commercial success depends, _inter alia, on not infringing the patents or violating the other_
proprietary rights of others. Our industry is characterized by significant litigation regarding patent rights. We do
not always conduct independent reviews of patents issued to third parties. Third parties may, in the future, assert
claims that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization, including claims from
competitors or from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own
patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect.

As we continue to commercialize our implant systems in their current or updated forms, launch new
products and enter new markets, we expect that competitors may claim that one or more of our implant systems
infringe their intellectual property rights as part of business strategies designed to impede our successful
commercialization and entry into new markets. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent
applications and issuances, the complexities of the technology involved, and the uncertainty of litigation may
increase the risk of business resources and management’s attention being diverted to patent litigation.

Moreover, as the initiation of such proceedings does not require the achievement of particularly high
value thresholds, we may become party to future proceedings relating to our own patent portfolio or that of third
parties, which could prove to be particularly costly and prolonged in time.

Any litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial defense
costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our
core business and harm our reputation. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties,
we could be required to pay substantial damages (which may be increased up to three times of awarded damages)
or substantial royalties and could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or are able to
redesign our products to avoid infringement. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all,
and there can be no assurance that we would be able to redesign our products in a way that would not infringe the
intellectual property rights of others. We could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to
develop alternative methods or products. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes
to our products or technologies, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to
commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world._**

The laws of certain countries, such as China, India, Turkey and Russia, do not offer robust protection of
intellectual property rights, which may make it difficult to address infringement of foreign patents, where
obtained, or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights. For example, certain countries limit patent
protection against certain types of third parties, including government agencies or contractors. In these countries,
patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country
basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose
not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such
countries. As a result, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.

Any patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of
our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. In particular, following the entry
into force of the Leahy-Smith Act America Invents Act and the implementing regulations promulgated by the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, inter alia: (i) it has been established in the United States the transition from a
system of protection “first to invent” to a system of protection “first to file,” such that patent protection is granted
to the first person to file the patent application, where the novelty of the invention compared to that of another
subject is not important; and (ii) a special administrative tribunal such as the Patent Trial and Appeals Board
(“PTAB”) has been established to provide a forum for any patent disputes.

69


-----

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we are unable to accurately predict the long-term impact of
PTAB proceedings on our business, and it cannot be excluded that the availability of the PTAB as a lower-cost,
faster and potentially more effective patent challenge court could result in an increase in the number of challenges
and/or claims, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
For example, the initial results of patent challenge proceedings before the PTAB since its inception in 2013 have
resulted in the invalidation of many U.S. patent claims.

**_If we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology, others could compete against us more_**
**_directly._**

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability in obtaining and maintaining issued patents and
other intellectual property rights and protecting our proprietary technology. If we do not adequately protect our
intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or
negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve
profitability.

Our standard practice is to seek patent protection for the intellectual property technical solutions relevant
to our business, including our TT technology, as well as for the solutions relating to our technology platform. As
of September 30, 2022, we owned 157 patents and had 155 patent applications pending. From time to time, we
may be involved in patent disputes. Patent litigation and challenges involving our patents are costly and
unpredictable and may deprive us of market exclusivity for a patented product. For example, our patent relating
to the TT technology was subject to litigation in the United States, which we successfully defended and prevailed
in affirming the validity of our patent. As of the date of this offering memorandum, a similar legal challenge
against our patent relating to the TT technology in Europe is pending. We intend to defend our TT technology
vigorously and believe that we have valid defenses to these claims. Litigation involving our patents carries the
risk that one or more of our patents will be held invalid or held unenforceable. An adverse court ruling could
allow third parties to commercialize our products or use our technologies and then compete directly with us,
without payment to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to achieve
profitability.

Our patents may not have, or our pending patent applications that mature into issued patents may not
include, claims with a scope sufficient to protect our implant systems, any additional features we develop for our
implant systems or any new products. Other parties may have developed technologies that may be related or
competitive to our platform, may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive
patents that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or devices or by
claiming subject matter that could dominate our patent position.

The patent positions of medical device companies, including our patent position, may involve complex
legal and factual questions, and, therefore, the scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may
obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable,
invalidated or circumvented. Proceedings challenging our patents could result in either loss of the patent or denial
of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent
application.

In addition to the potential deficiencies surrounding patents, we may not be able to prevent the
unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, suppliers, vendors,
former employees and current employees, which could have a negative impact on our business and competitive
position.

**_Our ability to protect our patent rights also depends on our ability to detect infringement or damages suffered_**
**_as a result of infringement, which may be difficult to identify, prove or quantify in the appropriate courts._**

In addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents could put our patents at risk of being
invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Such proceedings could also provoke third parties to
assert claims against us, including that some or all of the claims in one or more of our patents are invalid or
otherwise unenforceable. If any of our patents covering our implant systems are invalidated or found
unenforceable, our financial position and results of operations could be negatively impacted. In addition, if a court
found that valid, enforceable patents held by third parties covered one or more of our implant systems, our
financial position and results of operations could be harmed.

70


-----

**_Third parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential_**
**_information or misappropriated trade secrets._**

We may employ individuals who previously worked for and consultants who work or have previously
worked with other companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that
our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us,
we may be subject to claims (also judicial) that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have
inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information (including third parties’ confidential
information). Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims
or settling those claims, in addition to paying monetary damages or a settlement payment, we may lose valuable
intellectual property rights or involved personnel.

**_If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position could_**
**_be harmed._**

In addition to patent protection, we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection, as well as
non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third
parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information. In addition to contractual measures, we try to
protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures.
Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third
party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures
may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a
competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our
interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult,
expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable.

**Risks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment**

**_If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we may be required to suspend production or institute a_**
**_recall of our products or be subject to other enforcement actions._**

Our products are orthopedic implants that are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., Europe and
elsewhere, regulated by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which we operate. We are required to
manufacture and market many of our products internationally, in compliance with statutes and regulations such
as the EU Medical Devices Regulation, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) in the U.S.,
and the implementing regulations of the relevant government agencies. In order to demonstrate compliance with
the applicable requirements and obtain the right to sell our products, we must undergo authorization, certification
and other assessment procedures, which varies according to the type of medical device, its classification and the
market in which our products is going to be sold. Moreover, we are required to implement an effective quality
management system, which affects, inter alia, product design, production, documentation, personnel training and
qualification, handling, storage, distribution and installation of medical devices.

Our orthopedic implants and devices that we market in the U.S. are regulated as medical devices by the
FDA.

In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or
significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the
FDCA or approval of a premarket approval (“PMA”), from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k)
clearance process, before a device may be marketed, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is
“substantially equivalent” to a legally-marketed “predicate” device, which includes a device that has been
previously cleared through the 510(k) process, a device that was legally marketed before May 28, 1976 (preamendments device), a device that was originally on the U.S. market pursuant to an approved PMA and later
down-classified, or a 510(k)-exempt device. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the
same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate
device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness
than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the process
of obtaining PMA approval, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended
use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial,
manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the
greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices.

71


-----

Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally require FDA approval.
Similarly, certain modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k) clearance.
Both the PMA and the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA’s 510(k)
clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but can last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is
much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or
even longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA. In addition, a PMA generally requires the
performance of one or more clinical trials. Despite the time, effort and cost, a device may not be approved or
cleared by the FDA.

Subject to the transitional provisions and in order to sell our products in EU member states, our products
must comply with the general safety and performance requirements of the EU Medical Devices Regulation, which
repeals and replaces the Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be
able to affix the European Conformity (“CE”) mark to our products, without which they cannot be imported to,
sold or marketed in the EU. All medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the general safety and
performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation including the requirement
that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it
is suitable for its intended purpose. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the
clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and – where applicable – other persons,
provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against
the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into
account the generally acknowledged state of the art. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and
performance requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the
type of medical device and its (risk) classification. A conformity assessment procedure, depending on the risk
class of the medical device, requires the involvement of a notified body. The notified body would typically audit
and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our
devices. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance
requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its
own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the
device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations,
we would not be allowed to affix the CE mark to our products, which would prevent us from selling them within
the EU.

The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA. Non-compliance with the above
requirements would also prevent us from selling our products in these three countries.

Following the end of the “Brexit” transitional period, from January 1, 2021, the MHRA became
responsible for the UK medical device market. The new regulations require medical devices to be registered with
the MHRA (but manufacturers were given a grace period of four to 12 months to comply with the new registration
process) before being placed on Great Britain market. Manufacturers based outside the UK need to appoint a UK
Responsible Person to register devices with the MHRA in line with the grace periods. Subject to transitional
provisions, in the UK (England, Scotland, and Wales), all medical devices will require a UKCA (“UK
**Conformity Assessed”) mark but CE marks issued by EU notified bodies may remain valid until the new**
requirements become applicable. However, UKCA marking alone will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for
placing medical devices on the Northern Ireland market will differ from those in the UK.

If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, if they change in a manner adverse to us, or if
we fail to maintain, renew or secure any required permits, licenses, accreditations or other necessary regulatory
approvals or certifications, our reputation could be damaged and important relationships with government
regulators or third parties could be adversely affected. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable regulatory
requirements could result in governmental authorities issuing warning letters or untitled letters; imposing fines
and penalties on us; preventing us from manufacturing or selling our products; bringing civil or criminal charges
against us; delaying the introduction of our new products into the market; recalling or seizing our products; or
withdrawing, suspending or denying approvals or clearances or certifications for our products. For example, we
are currently in dialogue with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (the “TGA”) in Australia’s Department of
Health and Aged Care, and have provided submissions to the TGA, related to an elevated revision rate in Australia
pertaining to certain constructs within our SMR shoulder platform. If the TGA does not agree with our submission,
the TGA may order some form of regulatory action, which may impact the registration status and continuance of
these products/the SMR in the Australian market. As of the date of this offering memorandum, these discussions
are ongoing with the TGA and we believe we have a well-developed action plan to address such regulatory
concerns and outcomes.

The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are subject to certain federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws, which, if violated, could subject us_**
**_to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws_**
**_could cause adverse publicity and be costly to defend, and thus could harm our business._**

We are required to comply with U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign, laws pertaining to healthcare
fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims and transparency laws with respect to payments and other
transfers of value made to physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals. Our business practices and
relationships with medical facilities and hospital institutions are subject to scrutiny under these laws which,
therefore, could affect our operational capabilities.

These laws and regulations, among other things, constrain our business, marketing and other promotional
activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals,
physicians or other potential purchasers of our products, and include, but are not limited to the following:

      - The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and
entities from soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in
cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or furnishing or arranging for a
good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare
programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The U.S. government has interpreted this law
broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of medical device manufacturers. In
addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific
intent to violate it to have committed a violation;

      - The U.S. federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit,
among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be
presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs
that are false or fraudulent. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items
or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or
fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;

      - The U.S. federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering
or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should
know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services
reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;

      - The U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which, in
addition to privacy protections applicable to healthcare providers and other entities, prohibits,
among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making
false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a
person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate
it to have committed a violation;

      - The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act which requires certain applicable manufacturers
of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under certain
federal healthcare programs, to monitor and report to CMS, certain payments and other transfers
of value in cash or in kind to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists,
podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician providers (physician assistants, nurse
practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse
anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives), and teaching hospitals, to
report annually ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate
family members;

      - The FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs,
biologics and medical devices, and regulates device marketing;

      - U.S. federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate
marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm customers;

73


-----

      - Analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws
that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or
services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state
laws requiring device companies to comply with specific compliance standards, restrict
payments made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, and report
information related to payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers or
marketing expenditures; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving
private insurers; and

      - EU and other foreign law equivalents of each of the laws, including reporting requirements
detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers.

**_Ensuring that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and_**
**_regulations may involve substantial costs._**

We have a variety of arrangements with our customers that could implicate these laws, including, among
others, our partnership with HSS, consignment arrangements and practice of providing instrument sets to
customers at no additional cost, which could be viewed by the government as a prohibited transfer of value
intended to induce customers to purchase our products that are used in procedures reimbursed by a government
healthcare program. Though we have not experienced such issues, it is possible that governmental authorities may
conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law
involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. We could be adversely affected if
regulatory agencies determine our financial relationships with our customers and physicians to be in violation of
applicable laws. Due to the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe
harbors available, and the range of interpretations to which they are subject, it is possible that some of our current
or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws.

To enforce compliance with the healthcare regulatory laws, certain enforcement bodies have recently
increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to
a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to
investigations can be time and resource-consuming and can divert management’s attention from the business.
Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional
compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such
investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. Even an
unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to defend.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare laws or regulations described above or any
other healthcare regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and
criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as
Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement and the curtailment
or restructuring of our operations.

**_We may not receive, or may be delayed in receiving, the necessary clearances, or approvals or certifications for_**
**_modifications to our current products, and failure to timely obtain necessary clearances, or approvals or_**
**_certifications for modifications to our current products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business._**

In the United States, we have obtained clearance of several of our products through the 510(k) clearance
process. Any modification to these systems that has not been previously cleared may require us to submit a new
510(k) premarket notification and obtain clearance, or submit a PMA and obtain FDA approval before
implementing the change. Specifically, any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect
its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture,
requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make
this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer’s decision. The FDA may not
agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have made
modifications to 510(k)-cleared products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable
FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals were not
required. We may make modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new
510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit
new 510(k) notifications or PMA applications for modifications to our previously cleared products for which we
have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to
recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory
fines or penalties. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products

or modifications to existing products than we had expected, product introductions or modifications could be
delayed or canceled, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.

In the EU, we must inform the notified body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical
devices that we market or sell in the EU and the EEA of any planned substantial changes to our quality system or
substantial changes to our medical devices that could affect compliance with the general safety and performance
requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation or cause a substantial change to the
intended use for which the device has been CE marked. The notified body will then assess the planned changes,
determine the need for additional audits and verify whether the planned changes affect the products’ ongoing
conformity with the EU Medical Devices Regulation. If the assessment is favorable, the notified body will issue
a new certificate of conformity or an addendum to the existing certificate attesting compliance with the general
safety and performance requirements and quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the EU
Medical Devices Regulation. Similarly, as in the initial certification procedures, the notified body may take longer
time for its assessments, may object to our proposed changes or may require other or further changes to ensure
(ongoing) conformity with the EU Medical Devices Regulation in which case product introductions or
modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.

**_Our orthopedic products and implants may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required_**
**_to report to the regulatory authorities, and if we fail to do so, we would be subject to sanctions that could harm_**
**_our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

We are subject to the medical device reporting regulations of the regulatory authorities (the
“Regulators”) of the countries in which we operate, which require us to report to the Regulators when we receive
or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that our orthopedic implants may have caused or
contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could
cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we
become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of
which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to become aware of a reportable
adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected
or removed in time from the use of the implant. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the Regulators
could take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution,
imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearance, seizure of our products or delay in
clearance of future products.

The Regulators have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of
material deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an
unacceptable risk to health. The regulators’ authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is
reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily
recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur
as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or
design deficiencies, packaging defects or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations.

Depending on the corrective action we take to redress a product’s deficiencies or defects, regulators may
require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new marketing authorizations or certifications for the device
before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such clearances, approvals or certifications may
delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address
problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including warning
letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties or civil or criminal fines.

Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not
reportable to regulatory authorities. We may initiate voluntary withdrawals or corrections for our products in the
future that we determine do not require notification of applicable regulatory authorities. If regulators disagree
with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls and we may be subject to
enforcement action. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, potentially lead to
product liability claims against us and negatively affect our sales. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or
involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract
management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.

**_Our products must be manufactured in accordance with quality regulations and are subject to inspection by_**
**_FDA, other regulatory authorities and audit by notified body, and our failure to comply with these regulations_**

75


-----

**_could result in fines, product recalls, product liability claims, limits on future product clearances, reputational_**
**_damage and other adverse impacts._**

The methods used in, and the facilities used for, the manufacture of our products marketed in the United
States must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) which is a complex regulatory scheme
that covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, process controls, quality
assurance, labeling, packaging, handling, storage, distribution, installation, servicing and shipping of medical
devices. Furthermore, we are required to verify that our suppliers maintain facilities, procedures and operations
that comply with our quality standards and applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA enforces the QSR
through periodic announced or unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities, which may
include the facilities of subcontractors. Our products are also subject to comparable regulations enforced by other
state, national, local and foreign regulatory authorities. We or our third-party manufacturers may not take the
necessary steps to comply with applicable regulations, which could cause delays in the delivery of our products.
In addition, failure to comply with applicable FDA or foreign requirements or later discovery of previously
unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes could result in, among other things: (i) warning
letters or untitled letters; (ii) fines, injunctions or civil penalties; (iii) suspension or withdrawal of approvals or
clearances; (iv) customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, detention, seizures or recalls of our
products; (v) total or partial suspension of production or distribution; (vi) administrative or judicially imposed
sanctions; (vii) the FDA’s or foreign regulatory authorities’ or notified body’s refusal to grant pending or future
clearances, approvals or certifications for our products; (viii) clinical holds; (ix) refusal to permit the import or
export of our products; and (x) criminal prosecution of us or our employees. Any of these actions could
significantly and negatively impact supply of our products. If any of these events occurs, our reputation could be
harmed, we could be exposed to product liability claims and we could lose customers and suffer reduced revenue
and increased costs.

**_The clinical trial or investigation process is lengthy and expensive with uncertain outcomes. We have limited_**
**_data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of our products. Results of earlier studies may not be_**
**_predictive of future clinical trial or investigation results, or the safety or efficacy profile for such products._**

Clinical testing is difficult to design and implement, can take many years, can be expensive and carries
uncertain outcomes. We cannot guarantee that any clinical study we may conduct or sponsor in the future will be
successful or will otherwise generate data that support the performance of our products. Clinical trials and
investigations must be conducted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the FDA and other applicable
regulatory authorities’ legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, and are subject to oversight by these
governmental agencies and institutional review board or ethics committees at the medical institutions where the
clinical trials are conducted. Furthermore, we rely, and in the future may continue to rely upon, on contract
research organizations (“CROs”), and clinical trial or investigation sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct
of our clinical trials or investigations and while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we
have limited influence over their actual performance. To the extent our collaborators or the CROs fail to enroll
participants for our clinical trials or investigations, fail to conduct the study to required good clinical practice
standards or are delayed for a significant time in the execution of trials, including achieving full enrollment, we
may be affected by increased costs, program delays or both.

The initiation and completion of any of clinical studies may be prevented, delayed or halted for numerous
reasons, which could adversely affect the costs, timing or successful completion of our clinical trials. In addition,
disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the likelihood that we encounter such difficulties or
delays in initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials. Any of these
occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.

Furthermore, patient enrollment in clinical trials or investigations and completion of patient follow-up
depend on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity
of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, patient compliance, competing clinical trials
and clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product being studied in relation to
other available therapies, including any new treatments that may be approved for the indications we are
investigating.

**_The misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that_**
**_lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are_**
**_deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business._**

76


-----

Our currently marketed products are either Class II medical devices cleared by the FDA for specific
indications or they are Class I exempt for general orthopedic use. In the EU, our marketed products are classified
as Class Ir, Im, IIb and III. We train our marketing personnel and direct sales force to not promote our devices for
uses outside of the FDA-authorized, or certified indications for use, known as “off-label uses.” We cannot,
however, prevent a physician from using our devices off-label, when in the physician’s independent professional
medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians
attempt to use our devices off-label. Furthermore, the use of our devices for indications other than those cleared
by the FDA, or authorized by foreign regulatory authorities or certified by notified body may not effectively treat
such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.

If the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities determines that our promotional materials or training
constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or
subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance or imposition of an untitled letter, which
is used for violators that do not necessitate a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties.
We could face similar consequences from action by foreign regulatory bodies when offering our products outside
the United States. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action
under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws, if they consider our business activities to constitute
promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal,
civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government
health care programs and the curtailment of our operations.

In addition, physicians may misuse our products or use improper techniques if they are not adequately
trained, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. If our devices are misused or used
with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. As
described above, product liability claims could divert management’s attention from our core business, be
expensive to defend and result in sizeable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance.

**_The safety and efficacy of some of our products are not yet supported by long-term clinical data, which could_**
**_limit sales, market access to particular countries, and might therefore prove to be less safe or effective than_**
**_initially thought._**

Regulatory bodies are increasingly giving more importance to clinical data, some of which may not have
been collected by us in the past, which will be used by the relevant bodies to conduct audits of our products with
respect to specific clinical aspects under the EU Medical Devices Regulation. In addition, the collection and
publication of clinical data is required to obtain reimbursement for products marketed in certain markets outside
the EEA. Due to the recent introduction of such requirements at the European regulatory level, we may not have
available long-term clinical data supporting product safety and efficacy and related benefits required for the
re-certification of previously approved products, or may not have the necessary comparative data, as well as be
subject to increased regulatory and product liability risks. Further, future patient studies or clinical experience
may indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient outcomes. Such results would discourage
the adoption of our products by surgeons and clinicians, would significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected
sales and could prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability.

Finally, if we are unable to meet informational requirements for recertification of our products, we risk
withdrawal of those products from the market.

**_If we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, necessary regulatory clearances or approvals_**
**_to market our current or future products, we may be unable to sell these products._**

The developing, testing, manufacturing, marketing and selling of orthopedic products is subject to
extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory clearance and
approval of medical technology products is costly and time consuming. Product modifications may require
additional submissions, clearances, or approvals before the modified product can be marketed. In addition, we do
not know whether the necessary approvals or clearances will be granted or delayed for future products. Regulatory
authorities could also request additional information or clinical evidence that could adversely affect the time to
market and sale of our products. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance to
market, the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations, vary from country to
country. Further time spent in seeking regulatory clearances and approvals may delay the initiation of our
operations in a new country. Moreover, there can be no assurance that a product that has been approved for sale
in one country will be approved by the regulatory authorities of another country. Failure to obtain necessary
regulatory clearances or approvals, the restriction, suspension or revocation of existing clearances or approvals or

77


-----

any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on our future
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements._**

We operate in sectors characterized by specific and detailed laws and regulations which are constantly
changing, including laws and regulations with respect to public tenders, employment, workplace health and safety
and environmental protections. Several of our activities may also be subject to EU and local laws as well as
specific regulatory or professional body stipulations or licensing requirements. Failure to comply with applicable
regulations could result in substantial fines, claims relating to violations of social and working environment
legislation or revocation or suspension of authorizations, concessions and/or licenses.

In addition, certain provisions of public tender laws applicable in the countries where we currently
operate may require compliance with certain morality requirements to participate in public tenders related to, inter
alia, fraud, bribery and corruption, environmental violations, antitrust infringements, false statements to a public
contracting authority and crimes against the person or workplace safety violations. Failure to comply with such
rules may render us ineligible to participate in a public tender and may result in the termination of a public contract
awarded or entered into, exclusion from current public tenders, sanctions and penalties, civil and administrative
fines, operational bans and other restrictive provisionary measures.

**_We could be adversely affected by violations of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws applicable in the countries_**
**_where we conduct our business._**

Conducting our business in an ethically acceptable manner is important to our reputation, status with
regulators and business prospects. We have policies in place to prevent direct or indirect acts of corruption,
bribery, anti-competitive behavior, money laundering, fraud, deception, tax evasion and any other criminal or
otherwise unacceptable conduct.

However, such policies may be insufficient or our employees may not adhere to their letter and spirit. If
any of our personnel is found to have engaged in illegal or unethical acts, or we are found not to have taken
effective steps to manage and mitigate the risk or to address allegations or findings, of inappropriate conduct in
our business, this may damage our reputation, result in criminal, regulatory or civil sanctions, impair our ability
to participate in business with national healthcare providers and payors and may result in formal or informal
exclusions from such business, with material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

In particular, in Italy, under the Legislative Decree 231/2001 (the “Decree 231”) on the administrative
liability of legal persons, our Group companies may be held liable for certain crimes committed in Italy or abroad
(including corruption, fraud against the State, corporate offenses and market abuse) in their interest or for their
benefit, by individuals having a functional relationship with our Group companies, including directors, employees
and third party agents. However, pursuant to Decree 231, a defense can be established by an entity involved in a
Decree 231 proceeding and liability can potentially thus be excluded if it can prove that it had adopted and
properly implemented, prior to the commission of the crime, an organization, management and control model
aimed at effectively preventing the commission of such criminal acts (“Model 231”). The suitability of the Model
231 is judicially determined ex post, on the basis of a concrete assessment of the existing facts and circumstances.

We approved and adopted the Model 231 on March 31, 2011 (last updated in March 2022), and appointed
a supervisory body (organismo di vigilanza) (the “Supervisory Body”) with continuous oversight of the Model
231, that monitors and assesses the implementation status of preventive measures and reports regularly to the
Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not
extended the adoption of the Model 231 to our subsidiaries and therefore, the Model 231 applies only to us and
not to our foreign subsidiaries. Although we are currently evaluating the adoption of risk analysis procedures for
our foreign subsidiaries, pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, and our Group has already adopted a Code
of Ethics that is applicable to all our foreign subsidiaries. However, we have not yet implemented detailed controls
and procedures for our foreign subsidiaries regarding export and sanctions regimes, and anti-money laundering
laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with Decree 231 could result in the imposition of criminal sanctions on our directors
and employees and/or monetary sanctions, which would be determined by the judicial authority on the basis of a
quota system, in proportion to our financial conditions, and of other types of sanctions (e.g., interdictory sanctions,
including disqualifications, prohibitions, confiscation of the price or profits deriving from the crime and

78


-----

publication of the judgment) and loss of confidence of our customer base as well as render us ineligible to
participate in a public tender or result in the termination of a public contract already awarded, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

As part of our business activities, we are required to comply with the laws and regulations applicable in
the countries in which we operate on anti-corruption matters – including, for example, the United States Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 (the “Bribery Act”), the
Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (“OECD”) Anti-Bribery Convention – which, inter
_alia, prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering or making improper payments (or giving anything_
of value) to government officials and/or persons in the private sector or commercial partners for the purpose of
influencing them or intending to obtain or retain business or an advantage in the conduct of business on its behalf.

Our activities expose us to the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments or other financial or
other advantages by one of our employees, associated persons or our agents that could be in violation of applicable
anti-corruption laws. In 2014, in the U.S., we introduced the current internal control system (i.e. integrated
compliance) by setting out general principles and application guidelines and also established a policy concerning
the selection of our commercial partners (as well as a complex procedure for the compliance assessment of the
latter). Although we have policies, procedures and internal controls in place to monitor internal and external
compliance, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will protect us from governmental
investigations or inquiries surrounding actions of our employees or any agents or distributors that we might use
or, in the past, have used. In the future, there may be allegations of employees or agents acting in a way that is in
contravention of our requirements in relation to bribery, competition and third-party partners and it is possible
that such allegations might emerge in relation to past conduct, in any case potentially resulting in major
reputational and financial damage to the business.

In addition, allegations of instances of misbehavior on the part of former agents, current or former
employees or others acting on our behalf or on the part of public officials or other third-parties doing or
considering business with us could emerge. While we endeavor to monitor such press reports and investigate
matters that we believe warrant an investigation in keeping with the requirements of our compliance program, and
if necessary make disclosures to relevant authorities, any adverse publicity that such allegations attract might have
a negative impact on our reputation and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business practices.

**_Actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations,_**
**_standards and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial_**
**_condition._**

The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are or may become subject to numerous
state, federal and foreign laws, requirements and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention,
and security of personal data. Implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain
for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, standards, or
perception of their requirements may have on our business. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business,
affect our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal information,
necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional
costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in
the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, our
internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing our processing of personal data could result in negative
publicity, government investigations and enforcement actions, claims by third parties and damage to our
reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial
condition.

As our operations and business grow, we may become subject to or affected by new or additional data
protection laws and regulations and face increased scrutiny or attention from regulatory authorities. In the U.S.,
HIPAA imposes, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach
reporting of individually identifiable health information. Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and
security laws and regulations, which govern the privacy, processing and protection of health-related and other
personal information. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other
governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers
and strategic partners. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) went into effect on
January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy
and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties
for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach

79


-----

litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) recently passed in California. The CPRA
significantly amends the CCPA and will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses,
including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk
data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency
authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security
enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance
investment and potential business process changes may be required. Similar laws have passed in Virginia, and
Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend
toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The enactment of such laws could have potentially
conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. In the event that we are subject to or affected
by HIPAA, the CCPA, the CPRA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to
comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition.

We are subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”),
which went into effect in May 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals
within the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased
compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements
and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the
noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of
personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to
such personal data, including the United States; in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU (“CJEU”) limited
how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EU/EEA to the United States by invalidating the
Privacy Shield for purposes of international transfers and imposing further restrictions on the use of standard
contractual clauses (SCCs). The European Commission issued revised SCCs on June 4, 2021 to account for the
decision of the CJEU and recommendations made by the European Data Protection Board. The revised SCCs
must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021; existing standard contractual clauses
arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022. The new SCCs apply only to the
transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and not the UK. The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office has
published new data transfer standard contracts for transfers from the UK under the UK GDPR. This new
documentation will be mandatory for relevant data transfers from September 21, 2022; existing standard
contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the new documentation by March 21, 2024. There is some
uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether
they can be relied on for data transfers to non-EEA entities subject to the GDPR. As supervisory authorities issue
further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the SCCs cannot be used,
and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory
investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries
and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical
location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.

Failure to prevent an incident or event, including a cybersecurity incident or other data breach, could
amount to a breach of the GDPR. Non-compliance with the GDPR requirements can result in significant penalties
(up to the higher of €20 million or 4% of total annual global turnover), as well as litigation, compensation claims
by affected individuals (including class action type litigation where individuals suffer harm), regulatory
investigations, and enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data, which may have a
material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition, expose us to legal and regulatory costs,
and impair our reputation and goodwill. In addition, compliance with the requirements of the GDPR may increase
our legal, compliance, and operational costs. We are constantly working to ensure compliance with the
requirements set forth by the GDPR and we are continuing to implement measures in order to map all the risks
and to improve data protection. However, there can be no assurance that all GDPR measures have been fully and
correctly implemented or that the relevant data protection authorities' view on the level of compliance will
coincide with our views. This could in turn result in penalties, orders and/or claims against us which could have
a material adverse effect of our reputation and/or on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

Further, since the beginning of 2021, after the end of the transition period following the UK’s departure
from the European Union, we are also subject to the UK data protection regime, which imposes separate but
similar obligations to those under the GDPR and comparable penalties, including fines of up to £17.5 million or
4% of a noncompliant company’s global annual revenue for the preceding financial year, whichever is greater.
The relationship between the UK and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law
remains unclear, and the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the UK, enabling data
transfers from EU member states to the UK without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision

80


-----

will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews or extends that
decision. In September 2021, the UK government launched a consultation on its proposals for wide-ranging
reform of UK data protection laws following Brexit and the response to this consultation was published in June
2022. There is a risk that any material changes which are made to the UK data protection regime could result in
the European Commission reviewing the UK adequacy decision, and the UK losing its adequacy decision if the
European Commission deems the UK to no longer provide adequate protection for personal data. Other foreign
jurisdictions, such as China and Russia, are increasingly implementing or developing their own privacy regimes
with complex and onerous compliance obligations and robust regulatory enforcement powers. As we continue to
expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that
may affect how we conduct business.

**_Our business and operations may suffer in the event of information technology system failures, cyberattacks_**
**_or deficiencies in our cybersecurity._**

Our information technology systems and those of our third-party service providers, strategic partners and
other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to attack and damage or interruption from computer viruses and
malware (e.g. ransomware), malicious code, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical
failures, hacking, cyberattacks, phishing attacks and other social engineering schemes, employee theft or misuse,
human error, fraud, denial or degradation of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported
actors or unauthorized access or use by persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside
our organization. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result
a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information.

Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence,
sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with
a wide range of motives and expertise. Furthermore, because the technologies used to obtain unauthorized access
to, or to sabotage or disrupt, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a
target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may
also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. Even if identified, we may
be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools
and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic
evidence. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our
reliance on internet technology and the number of our and our service providers’ employees who are (and may
continue to be) working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit
vulnerabilities.

We and certain of our service providers are from time to time subject to cyberattacks and security
incidents. While we do not believe that we have experienced any significant system failure, accident or security
breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material
disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss, corruption or
unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets, personal information or other proprietary or sensitive information or
other similar disruptions. If a security breach or other incident were to result in the unauthorized access to or
unauthorized use, disclosure, release or other processing of personal data, it may be necessary to notify
individuals, governmental authorities, supervisory bodies, the media and other parties pursuant to privacy and
security laws.

Any security compromise affecting us, our service providers, strategic partners, other contractors,
consultants, or our industry, whether real or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode confidence in the
effectiveness of our security measures and lead to regulatory scrutiny. To the extent that any disruption or security
breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or systems, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or
proprietary or personal information, we could incur liability, including litigation exposure, penalties and fines, we
could become the subject of regulatory action or investigation, our competitive position could be harmed and the
further development and commercialization of our products and services could be delayed. If such an event were
to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our business. Further,
our existing insurance policies may not cover, or may cover only a portion of, any potential claims related to
security breaches to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all or any portion of
liabilities that may be imposed.

**_We are subject to examinations and challenges by tax and social contributions authorities in various_**
**_jurisdictions, and changes in tax and social contributions laws or regulations, or the application thereof, could_**
**_materially and adversely affect our business._**

Our tax returns and social contribution filings are prepared in accordance with the relevant tax and social
legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice and tax advice.
Challenges made by tax and social contributions authorities to our application of tax and social contributions rules
may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions. If any such challenges are
made and are not resolved in our favor, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result of
operations. Additionally, changes in tax and social contributions laws or rules or the application thereof could
increase the amount of tax and social contributions we must pay. Any adverse examination, challenge by tax and
social contributions authorities or change in tax and social contributions regulations could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our production facilities are subject to various health, labor, safety and environmental standards, and any_**
**_changes in these laws and regulations may affect our ability to continue production in a cost-efficient_**
**_environment._**

Our operations are subject to various supranational, national, regional and local laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment, health, labor standards and safety. These laws and regulations
govern, among other things, hazardous substances; emission and discharge of materials; the health and safety of
employees; and labor standards more generally. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are
often subject to public review and comment and have tended to become more stringent over time, particularly in
Italy, and we cannot therefore guarantee that our operations will be at all times in compliance with them. A failure
to comply could result in governmental fines and other sanctions, the temporary or permanent shutdown of
production facilities, third-party claims and/or negative publicity.

Any new legislation and regulation may impose significant and costly new obligations on us. Given all
of the foregoing, future costs and liabilities relating to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws,
regulations and permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_Government authorities may question our tax positions or transfer pricing policies or change their laws in a_**
**_manner that could increase our effective tax rate or otherwise harm our business._**

We are subject to taxation in Italy and in numerous states with different tax regimes. The actual tax rates
applicable to us in the future could be affected by a wide range of factors, including possible changes in tax laws
or their interpretation. We are also exposed to possible tax assessments in numerous jurisdictions and to the risk
that the relevant tax authorities disagree with any interpretation of the legislation as adopted by us and
consequently challenge the amount of tax paid. We are exposed to the risk that any provisions made in the financial
statements may not be sufficient to cover the costs of any tax assessment proceedings and penalties.

Although we believe that we have acted in compliance with current legislation and that our estimates are
reasonable, we are subject to the risk that, should claims be made by the competent tax authorities, any provisions
made in the financial statements will not be sufficient to cover the final outcome of such claims and the related
dispute, with consequent negative effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover,
the existence of numerous commercial and financial transactions between Group companies residing in different
countries for tax purposes may result in the competent tax authorities applying transfer pricing regulations (instead
of the criterion of agreed consideration). These regulations provide for the criterion of the "arm's length value",
i.e. a price determined, also on the basis of estimates made by us and our subsidiaries, in accordance with the
arm's length principle for the purposes of correctly allocating the taxable base to each of the companies involved
in these intercompany transactions and belonging to the same corporate group.

While we believe that we have operated in full compliance with national and international rules and
principles on transfer pricing, as defined by the OECD as a whole, since the regulations on this subject are complex
and potentially subject to different interpretations by the authorities of the various countries, there can be no
guarantee that the methods and conclusions reached by us and our subsidiaries are always fully shared by each of
these authorities. Therefore, there is a risk that, in the event of an audit by the tax authorities, disputes may arise
on the fairness of the transfer prices applied in intragroup transactions between Group companies resident in
different countries, which could lead to the request for higher taxes and possibly the application of administrative

sanctions pursuant to applicable regulations, with possible negative effects on our business, results of operations
or financial condition.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we are subject to ordinary inspections and investigations
by certain tax authorities, also concerning the issue of transfer pricing; in particular, we underwent a tax audit
relating to the 2016 tax period, which ended with the issuance of a Formal Notice of Assessment (“Processo
**_Verbale di Constatazione,” or “PVC”) on December 4, 2019, which contested us higher taxable revenues of_**
approximately €8.8 million under transfer pricing regulations. On February 3, 2020, we submitted our
observations pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 7, Law No. 212 of July 27, 2000, with reference to the PVC
received, asking the Italian Tax Authority (Agenzia delle Entrate) to acknowledge the unfoundedness of some
findings contained in the PVC and, consequently, not to proceed with the issuance of the notices of assessment,
reserving the right to produce further briefs and to initiate a possible contradictory discussion with the Italian Tax
Authority. On January 11, 2023, the Italian Tax Authority proceeded on the matter and sent us an invitation to
settle by paying an amount equal to approximately €3.2 million in taxes and reduced penalties, as well as
approximately €0.6 million of interest for late payment (calculated up to January 24, 2023) in a tax settlement
procedure to be held on January 31, 2023. As of the date of this offering memorandum, it is not possible to make
any assessments or forecasts regarding the outcomes of the aforesaid tax settlement procedure, but it is possible
that the Italian Tax Authority will issue a notice of assessment if a tax settlement agreement is not reached.
Moreover, if a tax settlement agreement is not reached and an assessment is issued, we would expect to appeal
the Italian Tax Authority’s assessment. It is possible that any appeals process may continue for several years
before a final outcome is reached. Amounts requested by the Italian Tax Authority in the foregoing invitation to
settle are determined on a provisional basis; should a tax assessment be issued, additional amounts in terms of
penalties and interest would be requested. To the extent that we are subject to any resulting fines, we would seek
to offset such fines against any available tax credits.

It should also be noted that in 2019 a request for prior agreement on transfer pricing was submitted to
the competent office of the Italian Tax Authority, concerning the prior definition of the methods (proposing the
use of the Transactional Net Margin Method – TNMM) for the definition of the “arm’s length value,” within the
scope of the sales of finished products by us to our subsidiaries. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we
are still waiting for the summons to be issued for the initiation of a hearing as part of this procedure (whose request
has been declared admissible by the Italian Tax Authority).

**_The Italian Golden Power Legislation may restrict our ability to pursue certain transactions or restrict the_**
**_ability of investors to acquire a significant stake in our share capital._**

We may be subject to the Italian Golden Power Legislation, pursuant to which the Italian Government
can, inter alia, prohibit or impose restrictions and conditions on (i) the acquisition of shareholdings in companies
having assets and relationships in sectors qualified as strategic (e.g., defense and national security, energy,
transport, communications, healthcare, _etc.), and (ii) resolutions, acts or transactions approved by companies_
holding assets and relationships in strategic sectors and resulting in a change in ownership, control or possession
of such assets or relationships, including the enforcement of securities over the shares / assets, or in the use or
purpose thereof.

In particular, acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the European
Union (including Italian) and acquisitions of interests by persons or entities not belonging to the European Union
that entail the acquisition of at least 10% of the voting rights or share capital (provided that the value of
investments is equal to at least €1 million) must be reported to the Office of the President of the Council of
Ministers for the possible exercise of the veto right or the application of conditions; acquisitions that exceed the
15%, 20%, 25% and 50% voting rights or share capital thresholds are also subject to the reporting obligation.
Starting from January 1, 2023, acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the
European Union are subject to the Italian Golden Power Legislation only if related to companies holding operating
in the defense and national security, communications energy, transport, healthcare, agri-food and financial sectors.
In the defense and national security sector, the relevant threshold is more than 3% voting rights or share capital
for both European Union and non-European Union investors. Resolutions, acts or transactions approved by a
company holding assets and relationships in strategic sectors that give rise to changes in the ownership, control
or possession of such assets, including the enforcement of securities over the shares / assets, or in the use or
purpose thereof must also be reported within ten days, and in any case prior to their implementation, to the Office
of the President of the Council of Ministers.

As a result, our ability to pursue commercial or industrial strategic resolutions, acts or transactions that
involve, by way of example, the acquisition of, or the subscription for, our shares by a partner (or that imply an

83


-----

amendment to our shareholders’ structure) may be impacted by the exercise by the Italian Government of its
special powers under the Italian Golden Power Legislation. On a more general note, if any of the companies
forming part of the Group is involved in any transaction, act or resolution falling within the scope of the Italian
Golden Power Legislation, the Italian Government may veto or impose conditions in order to consent to the
implementation of such transaction, act or resolution, which may, in each case, be material. Accordingly, we may
not be permitted to undertake such transaction, act or resolution in a timely fashion, without remedies or
undertakings, or at all. Therefore, the Italian Golden Power Legislation could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

Furthermore, in the future, our shareholders’ ability to enter into change of control or takeover
transactions relating to shareholdings in our share capital may be impacted by the exercise by the Italian
Government of its special powers under the Italian Golden Power Legislation. Our shareholders may not be able
to transfer their interests or such a transfer may be subject to conditions, which diminish the value of the
transaction and discourage investments. This may limit our shareholders’ ability to benefit from the proceeds of
certain proposed asset sales or acquisitions or business combinations, and may limit our shareholders’ ability to
benefit from possible premiums connected to a proposed change of control transaction, tender offer or other
strategic transactions.

**Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations under our debt, including the Notes._**

We have substantial indebtedness. As of September 30, 2022, we had indebtedness of €349.0 million,
including €54.0 million drawn under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and €275.0 under the Existing Notes.
Our substantial indebtedness may make it more difficult for us to operate our business and withstand or respond
to adverse or changing industry, regulatory and economic conditions or to take advantage of new business
opportunities or make necessary capital expenditures. When this indebtedness becomes due, any inability to
refinance or extend the maturity of this indebtedness on similar terms could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operations and liquidity positions. We intend to repay a substantial amount of our existing indebtedness,
including indebtedness maturing in the next twelve months, as part of the Refinancing. Following the Refinancing,
we will still have a significant amount of debt and significant debt service obligations. As of September 30, 2022,
_as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Refinancing and the application of the proceeds therefrom we would_
have had an aggregate principal amount of €326.1 million of total debt outstanding. See “Capitalization.” We will
be permitted to borrow substantial additional indebtedness, including secured debt, in the future under the terms
of the Indenture. See “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” For more
information, please refer to our consolidated balance sheet and corresponding notes thereto in the Consolidated
Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our business and holders
of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

    - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes or other indebtedness;

    - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment
of the principal of our indebtedness and interest on such indebtedness, thereby reducing the
availability of such cash flow;

    - limiting our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital or increase the cost of any such funding
to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, business
ventures, or other general corporate purposes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business, industry or the economic conditions in
the markets in which we operate;

    - exposing us to interest rate increases;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, general adverse economic conditions or
changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we do business;
and

84


-----

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are
not as highly leveraged.

These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition
and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.

**_Despite our current level of debt, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future, which may_**
**_make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes._**

In addition to the debt we will have outstanding following the Refinancing, we may incur substantially
more debt in the future. Our Revolving Credit Facility will provide for borrowings of up to €65.0 million (of
which we expect to draw €12.5 million on or about the Issue Date). The terms of the Indenture will limit, but not
prohibit us from incurring additional debt, including under the Revolving Credit Facility, or by a non-guarantor
or debt that is secured on assets of the Group, which debt would be satisfied ahead of the Notes and the Guarantees.
The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described in this offering
memorandum.

For further information regarding our leverage and for more information about our outstanding
indebtedness, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, and our ability to_**
**_generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

We are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financings, including the risk that our cash flow
will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest on debt and the risk that indebtedness will
not be able to be renewed, repaid or refinanced when due, or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not
be as favorable as the terms of such indebtedness.

Our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, and to fund working capital and capital
expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This
depends on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market,
legislative, regulatory, technical and other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond
our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on
the satisfaction of the covenants in the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and our other debt
agreements and other agreements we may enter into in the future. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement” for more information, including a description of the_
financial covenant we will be subject to in relation to the Revolving Credit Facility (a breach of which will
constitute a drawstop unless cured but will not constitute, or result in, a breach of any representation, warranty,
undertaking or other term in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). We cannot assure you that our business
will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt and equity financings will be available to us
in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

Prior to repayment of the Notes, we will be required to refinance or repay certain other debt, including
debt under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance or
repay any of our debt, including the Notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. This risk is exacerbated
by the disruptions in the capital markets that have continued since the last financial crisis, increased inflationary
pressures, the COVID-19 pandemic and the armed conflict in Ukraine and have resulted in tightened lending
requirements and in some cases the inability to refinance indebtedness. Any refinancing of our debt could be at
higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which
could further restrict our business operations. If we are unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain
new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as:

    - selling assets;

    - obtaining additional debt or equity capital;

    - restructuring or refinancing all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity;

    - foregoing opportunities such as joint ventures or acquisitions of other businesses; or

    - reducing or delaying our business activities and Capital Expenditures.

85


-----

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or
on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on our debt, including the Notes, on a
timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur
additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. There can be no assurance that any assets that
we may elect to sell can be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from
such sale will be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to
meet our obligations, which could cause an event of default under our debt and result in:

    - our debt holders declaring all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;

    - the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement being able to terminate their
commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings; and

    - our being forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in you losing your investment in
the Notes.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and_**
**_capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

Restrictive covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture may restrict our
ability to operate our business. Our failure to comply with these covenants, including as a result of events beyond
our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture will contain negative covenants restricting,
among other things, our ability to:

    - incur additional debt and issue guarantees and preferred stock;

    - make certain payments, including dividends and other distributions, with respect to outstanding
share capital;

    - make certain investments or loans, including participating in joint ventures;

    - repay or redeem subordinated debt or share capital;

    - create, incur or permit to exist certain liens;

    - impose restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the
Issuer;

    - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including shares of any of our restricted subsidiaries;

    - guarantee certain types of our other indebtedness without also guaranteeing the Notes;

    - effect a merger or consolidation of, or sell, all or substantially all of our assets or all of the assets of
certain companies within the Group;

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

    - impair the security interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

The restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture could affect our
ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential
business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance
our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our
capital needs. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events
beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of
these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the
Indenture.

86


-----

If there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments that is not cured or waived, the holders
of the defaulted debt could terminate their commitments thereunder and cause all amounts outstanding with
respect to such indebtedness to be due and payable immediately, which in turn could result in cross defaults under
our other debt instruments, including the Notes. Any such actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation,
and we may not be able to repay our obligations under the Notes in such an event.

**_Certain of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate, which could rise significantly, increasing our_**
**_costs and reducing our cash flow, or could otherwise be adverse to the interests of holders of the Notes._**

We are, and following the Refinancing will be, exposed to the risks of fluctuations in interest rates.

The Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes will be subject to variable interest rates indexed to EURIBOR.
We may also enter into additional indebtedness bearing floating rates of interest in the future, including by
issuing additional Notes. EURIBOR, the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) or the Secured
Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and/or any other floating interest rate applicable to such indebtedness
could rise significantly in the future. In addition, in response to rising inflation concerns, central banks have
begun increasing or signaling that they expect to increase interest rates. To the extent that interest rates were
to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase to the extent of the drawings
under, or issuances of, such debt bearing floating rates of interest, thereby reducing our cash flow. We may
enter into certain interest rate hedging obligations designed to fix a portion of these rates but are not required
to do so. In addition, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially
reasonable terms or, if available, will be successful in mitigating the risks related to increasing interest rates.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**_Hedging arrangements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging counterparties_**
**_fall into bankruptcy._**

From time to time, we may enter into interest hedging arrangements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates, including under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. Hedging itself carries certain risks,
including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements.
To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with these obligations would
correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk_
_Management.”_

We may also enter currency hedging arrangements in respect of indebtedness or our commercial operations.
Under any such agreements, we would be exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our
counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may
become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate such hedging agreements,
we may be required to make substantial termination payments, which would result in a loss. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures_
_about Market Risk—Currency Risk Management.”_

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries will not have any
obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee
the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and preference
shareholders (if any), will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims
of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by Holders under the Notes or the Guarantees. In the event of
any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade
creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any
assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be
structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, the terms of the Notes as well as our other indebtedness allow the
non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future, which will be structurally senior to the Notes.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”

As of September 30, 2022, after giving effect to the Refinancing, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries would
have had total debt of €0.1 million, which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees

thereof. In addition, the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum refer to the
Group and therefore contain information on both Guarantors and non-Guarantors. The Consolidated Financial
Statements may be of limited use in assessing the financial position of the Issuer and the Guarantors separate from
the non-Guarantors.

Moreover, any Guarantees would be subject to the significant limitations described under “Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”_
and, accordingly, the Notes would be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of any Guarantors to the extent
that such liabilities exceed the principal amount of Notes that can be guaranteed or secured by such Guarantors.

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted_**
**_as Collateral._**

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with
the Offering. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such Collateral will depend
on many factors, including the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, prevailing market and other economic
conditions, the availability of suitable buyers at the time of any such sale and any fees, taxes or duties required to
be paid under applicable law in connection with the enforcement of the Collateral. By its nature, the Collateral
may be illiquid and have no ascertainable market value. Similarly, we cannot assure you that there will be a market
for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in the liquidation
of the Collateral. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of the realizable value for
such assets. The fair market value of the Collateral as at the date of this offering memorandum may not exceed
the principal amount of the debt secured thereby. The value of the Collateral, and in particular, the pledged capital
stock, could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, failure to implement our
business strategy, competition and other future trends and may be without any value if that entity is subject to an
insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. For example, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of
the relevant jurisdiction may be different for those of the United States including in the areas of rights of creditors,
priority of government and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings.

If the proceeds of Collateral were not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the Notes and the
Guarantees, then holders of Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would
only have an unsecured claim against our remaining assets.

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging obligations, if_**
**_any, are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral realized in any enforcement procedure in_**
**_priority to the Notes._**

The Notes and the related Guarantees will be secured initially on a first-ranking basis by the same
Collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging
obligations.

In the event of enforcement of the Collateral, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging obligations, if any, will be entitled
to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral realized in any enforcement procedure in priority to the Notes. In
addition, under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement we will be permitted to incur significant
additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis
with the Notes and the related Guarantees and, to a lesser extent, on a priority basis, including the Revolving
Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, if any. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral,
holders of the Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims by creditors of
priority obligations are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral
will, after all priority obligations have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of
the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral that are permitted to rank pari passu and are secured
on a _pari passu_ basis with the Notes. As a result, proceeds of Collateral realized in connection with any
enforcement action may be insufficient to pay claims under the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, with respect to the Collateral, the Security Agent will

serve as the security agent for the secured parties under the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, certain
hedging obligations permitted by the Indenture to be secured by the Collateral and any additional debt secured
by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the Indenture. The Security Agent will act with respect to such

88


-----

Collateral only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The holders of the Notes will not have separate
rights to enforce the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not be able to instruct the Security
Agent, force a sale of Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under
the relevant Security Documents, unless it comprises an instructing group which for the Notes is holders of a
majority of the principal amounts of the Notes and any other debt permitted to rank pari passu with the Notes
(including certain secured hedging arrangements) (“Majority Senior Secured Creditors”). An instructing group
otherwise being holders of a majority of the principal amount of liabilities and commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations (“Majority Super Senior Creditors” such liabilities,
the “Super Senior Liabilities”) have separate rights in respect of voting and enforcement actions under the
Intercreditor Agreement.

Following acceleration by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior

Creditors, either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, acting
through their respective representatives, can commence the enforcement process by giving notice to the
Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
provide such notice to the Security Agent, they will be entitled to give instructions for the enforcement on the
Collateral. If (i) the Super Senior Liabilities are not repaid and discharged in full in cash from the proceeds
of enforcement or otherwise within six months of the date of the enforcement notice, (ii) the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors have not taken enforcement action within three months of the date of the enforcement
notice, (iii) certain insolvency events have occurred and no enforcement action has been commenced or (iv)
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not taken enforcement action and the Majority Super Senior
Creditors determine in good faith that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce on the Collateral or on
the expected realization proceeds of any enforcement on the Collateral, the Majority Super Senior Creditors
will be entitled to give instructions for the enforcement on the Collateral. In addition, See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of Notes in a number of respects and

may permit the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility or counterparties to certain hedging obligations
to control enforcement in circumstances in which their interests are different from those of the holders of
Notes. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and creditors under our Revolving Credit
Facility, the counterparties to the certain hedging obligations or holders of any permitted additional
indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to
the Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any
decisions of the instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant Collateral,
whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such noteholders.
The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the enforcement sale of any Collateral will be subject to, as a
condition to the release of any claims of any other indebtedness secured by such collateral under the
Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the recovery from an enforcement sale.
The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain hedging obligations or the
holders of any permitted additional indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interest of
holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant Security Documents at a
time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. Other creditors not
party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against us during the consultation
period, we could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could
otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness which
may be secured by security interests in the Collateral, the holders of the Notes may not comprise the requisite
majority of the senior secured creditors for the purposes of instructing the Security Agent. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes are first
issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely
affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such
Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors,
including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable
law.

89


-----

The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security
interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security
interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. In addition, the consents of any third
parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent
may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.
Furthermore, because the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the security interests in the
Collateral will be governed by the laws of a number of different jurisdictions, respective realization and
enforcement may be further delayed by court proceedings being taken in multiple jurisdictions.

**_The Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may_**
**_adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

The Guarantors are organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States, the UK, Germany,
Spain, France, New Zealand and Australia. The obligations of the Guarantors and the enforcement of each such
Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable
laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s
corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such
Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory
laws and would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur
civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Guarantee without a
corresponding increase in the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such Guarantee to its beneficiaries,
including the holders of the Notes.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to
certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the
Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. As
a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon
the law applicable to it.

It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a
bankruptcy of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee on any of the
above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the
extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively
subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor. Future
guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. See “Description of the Notes—The Notes Guarantees” and
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

**_You will not have the benefit of all of the Guarantees on the Issue Date._**

As of the Issue Date, the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture will not be guaranteed.
As further described in “Description of the Notes—The Notes Guarantees,” we have undertaken to procure that
no later than 90 days subsequent to the Issue Date each of the Guarantors execute a supplemental indenture and
accede to the Indenture as Guarantors. Prior to such accession, such subsidiaries will have no direct obligations
under the Indenture and holders of the Notes will have no direct claim on their assets. If one of such Guarantors
were to become subject to insolvency proceedings or would otherwise be considered insolvent under the
insolvency test discussed under “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” between the Issue Date and the date in which such Guarantee is put_
in place, holders of the Notes would face a greater risk of such Guarantee being challenged or voidable, which
could impair your recovery under the relevant Guarantee.

In addition, our undertaking to procure the accession of the Guarantors to the Indenture is contained in
the Purchase Agreement that we have entered into with the Initial Purchasers, rather than in the Indenture. If we
were unable, for some reason, to procure the accession of the Guarantors to the Indenture within the time period
specified herein, it would not constitute a covenant breach under the Indenture.

**_The Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_**
**_subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

The obligations of the grantors of security and enforcement of the Collateral will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be secured by such grantor of security under applicable law, including limitations to

90


-----

the extent that the grant of such security interests could be construed as not being in the relevant grantor’s
corporate interests, or otherwise would result in violations of laws related to corporate benefit, capitalization,
capital preservation, financial assistance or transactions under value.

Accordingly, enforcement in respect of the Collateral against the relevant grantor would be subject to
certain defenses available to security providers generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms
of the pledge of security designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant
grantors. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency,
voidable preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin
capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, the liability of a grantor of
security of could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the law applicable to it.

It is possible that a grantor of security, or a creditor of a grantor of security, or the bankruptcy trustee in
the case of a bankruptcy of a grantor of security, may contest the validity and enforceability of the grantor’s
creation of security on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the
security should be limited or voided. To the extent such limitations on the security obligation apply, the Notes
would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable grantor, including trade payables of such
grantor to the extent of such limitations. Future security may be subject to similar limitations.

Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes and the Guarantees may be voidable by the
grantor or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise
be set aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among
others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties
to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the
grantor is commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the
grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest.

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given
statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even
if such claims are secured claims. The enforcement on the Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law is
subject to mandatory provisions of Italian law, including in relation to procedures in respect thereof. Enforcement
of the Collateral may also be subject to certain statutory limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the
terms of the Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements. In
addition a parallel debt structure in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not
been tested in Italian and German courts and the validity and enforceability of certain rights of a Security Agent
benefiting from a parallel debt structure is untested in Italian and German courts. For a more detailed description
of various limitations on the security under Italian law and certain Italian insolvency law considerations, see
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations—Italy,” and for a more detailed description of certain limitations on the security under German_
law and certain German insolvency law considerations, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Germany.”_

**_The enforcement of the Collateral will require clearance under the Italian Golden Power Legislation._**

We may be subject to the Italian Golden Power Legislation, pursuant to which the Italian Government
can, inter alia, prohibit or impose restrictions and conditions on (i) the acquisition of shareholdings in companies
having assets and relationships in sectors qualified as strategic (notably, defense and national security, energy,
transport, communications, and healthcare, amongst others), and (ii) resolutions, acts or transactions approved by
companies holding assets and relationships in strategic sectors and resulting in a change in ownership, control or
possession of such assets or relationships, including the enforcement of securities over the shares / assets, or in
the use or purpose thereof.

In particular, acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the European
Union (including Italian) and acquisitions of interests by persons or entities not belonging to the European Union
that entail the acquisition of at least 10% of the voting rights or share capital (provided that the value of
investments is equal to at least €1 million) must be reported to the Office of the President of the Council of
Ministers for the possible exercise of the veto right or the application of conditions; acquisitions that exceed the
15%, 20%, 25% and 50% of the voting rights or share capital thresholds are also subject to the reporting obligation.
Starting from January 1, 2023, acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the
European Union are subject to the Italian Golden Power Legislation only if related to companies holding operating
in the defense and national security, communications energy, transport, healthcare, agri-food and financial

91


-----

sectors. In the defense and national security sector, the relevant threshold is more than 3% of the voting rights or
share capital for both European Union and non-European Union investors. Resolutions, acts or transactions
approved by a company holding assets and relationships in strategic sectors that give rise to changes in the
ownership, control or possession of such assets, including the enforcement of securities over the shares / assets,
or in the use or purpose thereof must also be reported within ten days, and in any case prior to their implementation,
to the Office of the President of the Council of Ministers.

To the extent an enforcement of the Collateral would result in the acquisition of an equity interest in the
Issuer or any other resolution, act of transaction included in the scope of the Italian Golden Power Legislation,
any such enforcement would require clearance under the Italian Golden Power Legislation.

**_Not all of the security interests in the Collateral will be granted on the Issue Date._**

As of the Issue Date, the Notes will only be secured by the Issue Date Collateral. As further described in
“Description of the Notes—Security,” the Post-Closing Collateral is expected to be granted no later than 90 days
following the Issue Date. If we or one of the applicable security providers were to become subject to insolvency
proceedings or would otherwise be considered insolvent under the insolvency test discussed under “Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”_
between the Issue Date and the date on which such Collateral is granted, any interests in such assets would face a
greater risk of being invalidated which could impair your recovery under the Notes and the Guarantees, as
applicable. Furthermore, our obligation to put in place security interests in the Post-Closing Collateral is contained
in the Purchase Agreement that we have entered into with the Initial Purchasers, rather than in the Indenture if we
are unable to grant such security interests for any reason, including reasons beyond our control, it could not
constitute a covenant breach under the Indenture. Additionally, the execution of the Collateral will be subject to
the Agreed Security Principles and additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the
Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, that could relieve certain Guarantors or other subsidiaries
of the obligation to grant security interests in assets otherwise expected to form part of the Collateral, which could
have a material adverse impact on the credit support available to you in connection with your investment in the
Notes.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the Holders_**
**_of the Notes and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by Italian law._**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that to the extent permitted by the applicable
laws, only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the
holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to
take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will
(subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral
and in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

The Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected
in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the
Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by
Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be
validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to
exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial
proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law
on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant
to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the
Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant
share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

The enforcement of any Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law is subject to mandatory
provisions of Italian law, including in relation to limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms
of the Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements.

In case of insolvency of any Guarantor, the enforcement of any Collateral provided by such Guarantor
may be subject to certain restrictions. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the
_Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

92


-----

**_The rights of holders of Notes in the Collateral securing the Notes may be adversely affected by the failure to_**
**_perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of
the security. The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the
claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of
these security interests. It should be noted, however, that the Security Agent shall have no obligation or duty to
take any action to perfect any of these security interests. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the
Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or the holder of the security interest having
difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral or adversely affect the priority of such security interest
in favor of third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the
same Collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on the ability of the holders of Notes to receive proceeds
from any enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights
acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property and equipment, only be perfected at or
promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. None of the Trustee or the
Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that
constitute Collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps to perfect, any security interest in the Notes against third
parties.

**_You may be required to pay a cash amount (soulte) in the event you decide to enforce a pledge over securities_**
**_granted under French law by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of securities rather_**
**_than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only be enforced following a payment default or an
acceleration resulting in a payment default and only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and
unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account
or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of
the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the
sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual
foreclosure (attribution _conventionnelle_ _(pacte commissoire)) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors,_
following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors
choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured
liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined
(by reference to the date of enforcement) either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a precontractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the
amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to
the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is
true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent
on-sale of the Collateral and whether or not the secured creditors are able to sell the Collateral for its full value as
determined by the expert.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to
the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance
with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale
price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold
pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the
vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition
of companies or groups of companies. See “Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount
_(soulte).”_

**_The granting of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such security interests_**
**_in accordance with applicable law._**

The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create hardening
periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions, including Italy. The applicable hardening period for
these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected,
amended, shared or recreated (as applicable). In addition, granting a shared security interest (including security

93


-----

interest in the Collateral) to secure existing, new or future indebtedness (such hedging obligations or any
additional Notes) or the transfer or the assignment of a security interest may restart or reopen hardening periods
in certain jurisdictions, including Italy. In each instance, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated
were to be enforced before the end of the relevant hardening period applicable in Italy, such security interest may
be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

In addition, under Italian law, in case any security interest (including security interest in the Collateral)
is released and retaken at any time, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start of a new
“hardening period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency
administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such
security interests. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or the Collateral across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is incorporated and validly existing under the laws of Italy; the Guarantors are organized and
validly existing under the laws of the UK, the United States, Germany, France, Spain, New Zealand and Australia.
The Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of those jurisdictions.
In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of
these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to
insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to
effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of
enforcement over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any
conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction
should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the guarantees and the security documents
in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability
_of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing_**
**_the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released
automatically, including:

    - in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the shares of the Issuer) to
a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to
the merger and consolidation covenant of the Indenture), if such sale or other disposition does not
violate the asset sales covenant of the Indenture or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the
Indenture;

    - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and capital stock, of such Guarantor;

    - as allowed under the amendments and waivers provisions of the Notes;

    - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes;

    - if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and capital
stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

94


-----

- (A) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization, or (B) in a transaction
that complies with the merger and consolidation covenant of the Indenture (subject to certain
additional requirements);

- in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral,
or the sale or transfer of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, in each case pursuant
to a Qualified Receivables Financing;

- in connection with any disposal of Collateral (other than the shares of the Issuer) to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such release is followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of
at least equivalent ranking over the same assets in a manner consistent with, and pursuant to
applicable formalities under, the impairment of security covenant of the Indenture;

- with respect to the Security Interests in respect of the Capital Stock of a Person or its Restricted
Subsidiary to be offered, within a reasonable time to facilitate an initial public offering in which
such Person or its Restricted Subsidiary is the IPO Entity; provided that, such security interests so
released shall be promptly granted or re-granted, as applicable, in favor of the Notes in the event
that such capital stock is not sold or the initial public offering does not complete for any reason;

- as permitted by the impairment of security covenant of the Indenture;

- in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

- as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees will be released automatically, including:

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the capital stock
of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as
a result of the sale or other disposition;

- upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all
the assets of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), if
the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture;

- upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the relevant Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

- upon payment in full of all principal, interest and other obligations in respect of the Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes;

- upon the release of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to Guarantee the Notes; provided that no other Indebtedness is at that time
guaranteed by the Guarantor that would result in the requirement that the Guarantor provide a Note
Guarantee pursuant to the same covenant;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

- as allowed under the amendments and waivers provisions of the Notes;

- in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

- as a result of any other transaction permitted by the merger and consolidation covenant of the
Indenture;

- with respect to any Guarantor that is an immaterial subsidiary, upon written notice from the Issuer
to the Trustee so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such
Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the
Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) does not Guarantee certain other indebtedness;

95


-----

    - as allowed under the additional guarantees covenant of the Indenture; or

    - as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Guarantees and security interests will be subject to release upon a distressed disposal as
contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement.

See “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

**_Upon an IPO pushdown, certain Collateral and Guarantees may be released, any retaken Collateral may be_**
**_subject to hardening periods, and holders of the Notes may be subject to adverse tax consequences._**

On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering (as defined under “Description of the
_Notes”), the Indenture (and terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) will provide that the Issuer or its successor shall_
be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent) that the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate
(with effect from the date specified in such notice) as described in “Description of the Notes—IPO Pushdown”
and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Group Pushdown.” The
Indenture will provide that, upon consummation of an IPO pushdown, among other things, certain Collateral or
Guarantees may be released. Moreover, we may elect to, but are under no obligation to, revoke or otherwise
reverse an IPO pushdown, or to replace any Guarantees or Collateral released pursuant thereto, in the event that
such IPO pushdown is not consummated. To the extent that new security documents in respect of any collateral
to be retaken (including, for example, a pledge over the shares of the Issuer) are entered into, such collateral may
be subject to new hardening periods.

In addition, in the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under
“Description of the Notes—IPO Pushdown” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement—Group Pushdown,” such change in the Issuer could result in a deemed exchange of the Notes for_
“new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If so, U.S. Holders would recognize any gain or loss in
connection with such taxable exchange (although any such loss could be disallowed) and would have a new
holding period and new tax basis in the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market
value of the Notes at the time of the IPO pushdown is less than the principal amount of the Notes (by more than
a statutorily defined de minimis amount), such Notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount
(“OID”), or a greater amount of OID, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Please see “Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—IPO Pushdown.”_

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under “Description
_of the Notes—IPO Pushdown” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—_
_Group Pushdown,” such change in the Issuer may have adverse tax consequences for Italian and non-Italian_
resident holders of the Notes as, among others, it may trigger the realization of a taxable capital gain.

**_The Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all_**
**_noteholders with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes._**

The Indenture will contain provisions for calling meetings of the holders of the Notes to consider matters
affecting their interests generally. As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Meeting of Holders of Notes,” the
majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of Notes will be one or more
persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. These
provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders
of the Notes, including holders of Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of Notes
who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary
resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of
principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption
or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the quorum
requirements relating to meetings and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and change the
amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of Notes and may have
a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes. Under Italian law, the approval of an extraordinary
resolution typically requires the consent of more than one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes. Our decision to increase the majority requirement is untested under Italian law, may be challenged by

96


-----

holders of the Notes, the Issuer and others, and if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian court, with the
consequence that the majority voting threshold may be reduced from 75% to 50%.

**_The insolvency laws of Italy and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to holders of Notes as_**
**_U.S. insolvency laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar._**

The Issuer is incorporated and is likely to have its center of main interests under the laws of Italy. The
insolvency laws of Italy and other applicable jurisdictions (for example, the jurisdictions in which the Guarantors
are incorporated or organized) may not be as favorable to your interests as those of the United States or another
jurisdiction with which you may be familiar. In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement could
be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the extent its covenants and provisions, which are untested under
Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. In the event that the
Issuer or one or more of the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty
in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of
such proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings
in jurisdictions you may be familiar with). As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes and the
Collateral in an insolvency situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. See “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Fraudulent conveyance and similar laws may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes,_**
**_Guarantees or security interests._**

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other
laws, a court could subordinate or void any Guarantee or security interest provided by such Guarantor or collateral
provider and, if payment has already been made under the relevant Guarantee or security interest, require that the
recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court found that:

    - the Guarantee was granted or the security interest created with actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or other person or, in certain jurisdictions, even
when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or the collateral provider was insolvent
when it granted the Guarantee or security interest;

    - the Guarantee was entered into or, as the case may be, the security interest was created without a
legal obligation to do so, is prejudicial to the interests of the other creditors and both the Guarantor
or collateral provider and the beneficiary of the Guarantee were aware of or should have been aware
of the fact that it was prejudicial to the other creditors;

    - the Guarantor or, as the case may be, the collateral provider did not receive fair consideration or
reasonably equivalent value for the Guarantee or the granting of the security and/or the Guarantor
or collateral provider: (i) became insolvent before the granting of the security or was insolvent or
rendered insolvent because of the issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the security interest;
(ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the issuance of the Guarantee or the
creation of the security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur,
indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

    - the Guarantee or security interest was held to exceed the objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the
best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor;

    - the Guarantee or security interest was entered into within a certain time period prior to the opening
date of insolvency proceedings of the Guarantor; or

    - the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

The measures of insolvency for the purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law
applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, an entity
would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred the debt:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of its
assets;

97


-----

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay
its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute
and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We cannot be sure as to what standard a court would apply in making a solvency determination or that a
court would conclude that the Issuer was solvent immediately after the issuance of the Notes.

Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests
granted to secure the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other
creditors or by operation of law under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the
relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain
legally specified period (the “suspect period”). See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security
_and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for further information._

If challenged successfully, the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received
must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, the holders
of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the
related security documents.

For a description of fraudulent conveyance and similar laws in other jurisdictions where the Guarantors
are organized, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

In addition, Italian insolvency laws and regulations have recently been replaced by a new crisis and
insolvency code – introduced by virtue of, among others, Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019
implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 (as subsequently amended and
supplemented, the “Italian Insolvency Code”, also known as Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency) – being a
comprehensive legal framework regulating, among others, insolvency matters. Other than for minor changes in
certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, the Italian
Insolvency Code came into force starting from July 15, 2022. The previous Italian Bankruptcy Law continues to
apply only to filings for proposals of declaration of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans
(concordato fallimentare) and filings seeking the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) or the opening of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo), in_
each case filed or pending before July 15, 2022. As at the date hereof, the vast majority of the provisions of the
Italian Insolvency Code are untested in Italian courts and there is no guidance or case law available yet on its
application; accordingly, the practical consequences of the implementation of the Italian Insolvency Code cannot
be foreseen as of the date of this offering memorandum. For a description of Italian insolvency laws and
regulations, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset disposition_**
**_offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes_**
**_in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of control” of the
Issuer.

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase.

If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available
at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow
us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default, or acceleration of the
debt, under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, PIK Loan Agreement and agreements governing our other
indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of events constituting a change of control under the Revolving Credit
Facility, the PIK Loan Agreement or our other indebtedness may not constitute a change of control under the
Indenture, and vice versa, and certain of the negative covenants under the PIK Loan Agreement may be more

98


-----

restrictive than those under the Indenture. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a change of control offer could
cause a default under our other indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The source of funds for
any repurchase required will be available cash or cash generated from operating activities or other sources,
including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity or funds provided by subsidiaries. The ability of the Issuer
to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence
of a change of control may be limited by our subsidiaries’ then existing debt instruments. If we would require
third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control, we cannot assure you
that we will be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a
change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in
the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization
or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control”
as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the
Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in
the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be
deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated net
leverage ratio of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

The definition of “change of control” in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all”
of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether
a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

Moreover, in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture, we will be required to commence an asset
disposition offer (as defined under the Indenture) to all holders of the Notes pursuant to which we will be obligated
to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” In
connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any
third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will also have the right to redeem the Notes that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other
holder of the Notes (provided that such price shall not be less than 100% of the principal amount).
See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein
and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision,
suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by
the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or
withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may
materially adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could materially adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Italian tax legislation may restrict the deductibility of all or a portion of the interest expense on our_**
**_indebtedness, including interest expense in respect of the Notes._**

Current tax legislation in Italy (Article 96 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as
amended and restated) allows for the full tax deductibility of interest expense incurred by a company in each fiscal
year up to the amount of the interest income of the same fiscal year, as evidenced by the relevant annual financial
statements. A further deduction of interest expense in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30%
of fiscal EBITDA of a company (i.e. risultato operativo lordo della gestione caratteristica) (“ROL”) determined
according to tac rules for the calculation of the corporate income taxable base. The amount of ROL and interest
income exceeding interest expenses not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expenses in a fiscal year
can be carried forward, respectively for the following five fiscal years and without time limits. Net interest expense
not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward and deducted in the following fiscal years, provided
that and to the extent that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income is
lower than 30% of ROL. The carried forward ROL, determined according to accounting rules under the previously
applicable limitation provision could be offset only with interest expenses incurred on loans granted before 17
June 2016, to the extent that their maturity and their total amount committed have not been changed as of that
date. In the case of an Italian tax group, interest expense not deducted by an entity in the Italian tax group due to
lack of ROL can be deducted at the tax unity level, within the limit of the excess of ROL of the other companies
within the Italian tax group.

Our ability to deduct interest expense in respect of the Notes and other indebtedness incurred by
companies within the Group will therefore depend on the ROL and our ability to have tax group arrangements.
Any delay in the effectiveness of a tax group will impact the ability to deduct interest expense. The failure to
achieve such a tax group could adversely impact our ability to use ROL to offset interest expense, including, inter
alia, in respect of any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, there can be no assurance that
in the case of a tax audit, the relevant tax authorities would not try to challenge the deductibility of interest
expenses arising in connection with the component of any financing used, in whole or in part, to refinance an
outstanding loan or debt, when the terms and conditions of the refinancing transaction appear less favorable than
the ones of the previous financing transaction. In particular, in such circumstances, the relevant tax authorities
could argue that the interest expenses arising from such financing do not relate to the business of the borrowing
entity (as the relevant transaction is deemed to be “antieconomic” and as such not compliant with the “inherence”
principle set out under Italian tax law).

Moreover, (i) any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation or application (including
any future limitation on the use of the ROL of the Issuer and its subsidiaries), or (ii) the tax treatment of interest
expense arising from any indebtedness, including the Notes, the failure to satisfy the applicable legal requirements
relating to the deductibility of interest expense or (iii) a change in the interpretation and application by Italian tax
authorities of Italian tax law may result in our inability to fully deduct our interest expense, which may have an
adverse impact on our financial condition.

The tax deduction of a negative item of income (interest expenses included) may also be denied under
the Italian anti-hybrid mismatch rules laid down in Article 6 and ff. of Legislative Decree 29 November 2018, no.
142 (“Decree 142/2018”), which transposed into national law the EU Directive 2016/1164 (ATAD 1) as amended
by the EU Directive 2017/952 (ATAD 2). The Italian anti-hybrid rules only apply if a hybrid mismatch outcome
arises between associated enterprises, as defined in art. 6(1)(u) of Decree 142/2018 or in the context of a structured
arrangement, as defined in art. 6(1)(q) of Decree 142/2018.

A hybrid mismatch outcome may occur in the following cases: (i) the interest expenses are tax deductible
in Italy and in another jurisdiction (double deduction, “DD”); or (ii) the interest expenses are tax deductible in
Italy and the corresponding interest income is not included in the taxable income of the payee jurisdiction
(deduction without inclusion, “D/NI”); or (ii) the payment directly or indirectly funds deductible payments giving
rise to an hybrid mismatch (imported mismatch).

**_You may face currency exchange risks or adverse tax consequences by investing in the Notes denominated in_**
**_currencies other than your reference currency._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a pounds sterling, U.S. dollar or other
non-euro investor, an investment in the Notes will entail currency exchange-related risks due to, among other
factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro to pounds sterling, U.S. dollar or other relevant
currencies because of economic, political or other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro
against pounds sterling, U.S. dollar or other relevant currencies could cause a decrease in the effective yield of

100


-----

the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated
into the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments. Investments in the Notes by
U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign currency exchange gains or losses,
if any. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

**_You generally will not be entitled to a gross-up for any Italian withholding taxes, unless the Italian withholding_**
**_tax is caused by a failure of the Issuer or the Guarantor to comply with certain procedures._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy and therefore payments of principal and
interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to Italian tax laws and
regulations. All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Notes will be made free and clear
of withholding or deduction of Italian taxation, unless the withholding or deduction is required by law. In that
event, the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as will result in the holders of the Notes receiving such amounts
as they would have received in respect of such Notes had no such withholding or deduction been required. The
Issuer is not liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes under certain circumstances, including
if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996
(“Decree No. 239”) or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (“Decree No. 461”),
except where the procedures required under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an
exemption have not been complied with due to the actions or omissions of the Issuer, or the Guarantors or its
agents. In such circumstances, investors subject to Italian withholding tax will only receive the net proceeds of
their investment in the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts” and
“Certain Tax Considerations—Certain Italian Tax Considerations.”

**_No assurance can be given that the listing of the Notes will satisfy the listing requirement of Decree No. 239._**

No assurance can be given that the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange will satisfy the listing requirement of Decree No. 239 in order for the Notes to be eligible to benefit
from the provisions of such legislation relating to the exemption from the requirement to apply withholding tax.
The Italian tax authorities issued an interpretive circular relating to, among others, the listing requirement of the
aforementioned legislation that may be interpreted to require that the Notes be listed upon their issuance to benefit
from the aforementioned provisions, including the exemption from the requirement to apply withholding tax. In
the event that the Notes are not listed or that such listing requirement is not satisfied, payments of interest,
premium and other income with respect to the Notes would be subject to a withholding tax, currently at a rate of
26%, and, subject to certain exceptions, see “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” we would be required
to pay additional amounts with respect to such withholding taxes such that holders receive a net amount that is
not less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of such withholding. The Italian tax
authorities may, however, interpret the applicable legislation that requires listing to be effective at closing (upon
issuance of the Notes) and we cannot assure you that the listing can be achieved by the Issue Date. The imposition
of withholding taxes with respect to payments on the Notes and the resulting obligation to pay, subject to certain
exemptions, additional amounts to holders of the Notes could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

Under current law, Italian withholding tax will not be imposed under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461
where the Notes are listed on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility upon issuance and a holder of
Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country or territory which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information
with the Italian tax authorities as included in (i) the decree of the Ministry of Economy and Finance of September
4, 1996 as subsequently amended and supplemented and replaced or (ii) once effective, in any other decree that
will be issued in the future under Art. 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239 to provide the list of such countries or territories
(any of such decrees, the “White List”) and such holder complies with certain certification requirements, there is
no assurance that this will be the case. Moreover, holders of Notes will bear the risk of any change in Decree No.
239 after the date hereof, including any change in the White List countries.

**_No assurance can be given that the procedural requirements to apply the Italian tax regime provided by Decree_**
**_No. 239 in respect of the Notes will be met by the relevant foreign intermediaries._**

The regime provided by Decree No. 239 and in particular the exemption from withholding tax, which is
in principle granted to holders of the Notes who are the beneficial owners of the proceeds from the Notes and who
are resident in a country or territory included in the White List, applies if certain procedural requirements are met.
It is not possible to assure that all non-Italian resident investors can claim the application of the withholding tax
exemption where the relevant foreign intermediary fails to comply with the procedural rules set for the application
of the exemption regime or fails to provide sufficient information to the relevant Italian tax authorities under the

101


-----

procedures set for applying the exemption regime. See “Tax Considerations—Certain Italian Tax
_Considerations.”_

**_Italian withholding taxes or deduction may be payable on amounts paid by a Guarantor._**

Under a certain interpretation, payments made to non-resident entities without an Italian permanent
establishment to which the Notes are effectively connected by a Guarantor may be subject to Italian withholding
taxes or deduction of taxes. The possible imposition of withholding taxes or deduction of taxes with respect to
payments on the Notes and the resulting obligation to pay additional amounts to noteholders could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_A German guarantor may be obliged to withhold on payments to certain investors incorporated, established or_**
**_otherwise tax resident in non-cooperative jurisdictions._**

In case an investor is incorporated, established or otherwise tax resident in a non-cooperative tax
jurisdiction (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) within the meaning of the German Act to Avert Tax Evasion
and Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb)
payments of interest or payments in lieu of interest by a German tax resident (such as payments by a German
guarantor) would be subject to German non-resident taxation (beschränkte _Steuerpflicht). A jurisdiction will_
qualify as non-cooperative if it fulfils the requirements defined in the German Act to Avert Tax Evasion and
Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb). The
requirements defined aim to capture jurisdictions that do encourage abusive tax practices and do not comply with
international tax standards and are based on and implement the EU Council’s conclusions on the EU list of
non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (as updated and amended from time to time) and relating defensive
measures approved by the EU Council. The withholding tax obligation under the German Act to Avert Tax
Evasion and Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb)
is applicable as of 1 January 2022. The withholding tax rate is 15% of the gross payments (plus solidarity
surcharge). The application of the law, in particular the withholding obligation, in case of financial instruments
held via a clearing system and payments by a guarantor is, however, unclear.

**_Transactions in the Notes could be subject to the EU financial transaction tax, if adopted._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”)
for a Directive for a common financial transaction tax (“EU FTT”) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France,
Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (the “Participating Member States”). On
December 8, 2015, Estonia indicated that it would no longer be a Participating Member State. The Commission’s
Proposal is still pending before the Council of the EU and its status is regularly discussed at the European and
Financial Affairs Council. Moreover, in the course of 2020, the European Commission brought to the attention of
the Council of the EU and the EU Parliament the possibility to propose, by June 2024, the introduction of a
reshaped EU FTT as a new EU own resource. The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and, if introduced
in its current form, could apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in
certain circumstances.

Under the Commission’s Proposal, the EU FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both
within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes
provided that at least one party to the transaction is established or deemed established in a Participating Member
State and that there is a financial institution established or deemed established in a Participating Member State
which is party to the transaction, acting either for its own account or for the account of another person, or acting
in the name of a party to the transaction. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a
Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person
established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings
is issued in a Participating Member State.

The Commission’s Proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It
may, therefore, be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU
Member States may decide to participate and/or other Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. If
the Commission’s Proposal or any similar tax were adopted, transactions in the Notes could be subject to higher
costs and the liquidity of the market for the Notes may be diminished.

Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisers in relation to the consequences of the EU
FTT associated with purchasing and disposing of the Notes.

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws, which may adversely affect_**
**_their liquidity and value._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. Therefore, you may not transfer or sell the Notes in the
United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or laws of any other jurisdiction, or pursuant to an
effective registration statement, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment in the Notes for an
indefinite period of time. The Notes are not being offered for sale in the United States except to “qualified
institutional buyers” in accordance with Rule 144A, and we have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register
the Notes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (including by way of an exchange offer). In
addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any
investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate principal
amount of less than €100,000. It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of
the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to
_Investors.”_

**_You may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against the Issuer._**

The Issuer, certain of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside of the United
States. Most of our directors and executive officers and most of the directors and executive officers of the
Guarantors are non-residents of the United States and most of their respective assets will be located outside the
United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States
upon the Issuer, the non-U.S. Guarantors or their respective directors and executive officers, or to enforce any
judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws.
Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of many foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i)
judgments of United States courts obtained against the Issuer, the non-U.S. Guarantors and the directors and
executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions
against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws. See “Service of
_Process and Enforcement of Judgments.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream. We
refer to beneficial interests in such global notes as “Book-Entry Interests.”

Interests in the global notes will trade in book-entry form only, and the Notes in definitive registered
form, or Definitive Registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for Book-Entry Interests only in very limited
circumstances. Owners of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered owners of the Notes. The nominee of the
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes
representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global
notes representing the Notes will be made to GLAS Trust Company LLC, as Paying Agent, which will make
payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that
hold Book-Entry Interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect
participants. After payment to Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the
Registrar, the Transfer Agent or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts by Euroclear and Clearstream or to owners
of Book-Entry Interests. Accordingly, if you own a Book-Entry Interest, you must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear and Clearstream, on the procedures of the
participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes
under the Indenture.

Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of Book-Entry Interests will not have the direct right to
act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if
you own a Book-Entry Interest, you will be reliant on the common depositary (as registered holder of the Notes)
to act on your instructions and/or will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate
proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested
actions or to take any other action on a timely basis. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no market. We cannot assure you as to:

    - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

    - your ability to sell your Notes; or

    - the prices at which you may be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including the liquidity of the market for
the Notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic
conditions and our own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as third-party recommendations.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has from time to time been subject to disruptions that
have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market
for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes and may be adversely affected by a general
decline in the market for similar securities. In addition, the trading market for the Notes may attract different
investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. The Initial Purchasers have informed us
that they intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue
such market-making at any time without notice. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market
for the Notes will develop or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained, and any disruption in the trading
market for the Notes may have a negative effect on your investment regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at fair value, if at all.

Although an application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market, we cannot assure you that the Notes will
remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading
on the Euro MTF Market, the delisting of the Notes (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on
another stock exchange), as applicable, from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange may have a
material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

**_Certain covenants will be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive a
rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s or a rating of BBB– or better from Standard & Poor’s or Fitch and no default
or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day the provisions of the Indenture
described in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of
_Investment Grade Status” will not apply to the Notes._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency to such Notes should
subsequently decline to below Baa3 or BBB–, as applicable, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and
from the date of such rating decline. If these covenants were to be suspended, we would be able to incur additional
debt or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of
the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such
rating will be maintained.

**_The Notes will be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes will be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Investors in the Notes subject to U.S. federal income taxation generally will be required to include such OID in
their gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of
their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, such investors generally will
include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. See “Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Original Issue Discount.”_

**_Total remuneration under the Notes will be automatically reduced if it exceeds the anti-usury cap levels set_**
**_under Italian law_**

Under Italian law, any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by
an Italian company, to pay any portion of remuneration applicable to the Notes (including interest, default interest,
fees, charges, expenses and other costs and any other form of compensation related to the Notes) in excess of the

104


-----

thresholds permitted under Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996, as amended from time to time and related
implementing rules and regulations (the “Italian Usury Law”) may not be enforceable. Although the applicability
of the Italian Usury Law to securities such as the Notes (and, among others, related original issue discounts and
make-whole payments that may be due under the applicable indenture) remains untested, the Indenture will
provide that, if the remuneration applicable to the Notes (including interest, default interest, fees, original issue
discounts, premium, charges, expenses and other costs and any other form of compensation related to the Notes
(the “Total Remuneration”)) at any time exceeds the maximum remuneration permitted under the Italian Usury
Law, then the Total Remuneration shall immediately and automatically be reduced to the maximum remuneration
permissible under the Italian Usury Law for, and limited to, the period during which it is not possible to apply the
remuneration as originally provided. This will result in a change of the economic terms of the Notes which, in
turn, may adversely impact the rights of the holders of the Notes and may have a material adverse effect on the
market value of the Notes.

**Overview**

We are a global orthopedics company providing a broad range of innovative and technology-driven joint
replacement solutions used by surgeons to restore motion for patients. Our offering includes extremities
(comprising shoulder and elbow), knee and hip implants as well as ancillary fixation products. We are committed
to transforming every patient’s life by restoring motion through leading technologies. Over the years, we have
developed cutting-edge solutions such as 3D printed implants (utilizing our proprietary Trabecular Titanium
(“TT”) technology) and custom made solutions for complex cases (“ProMade”). We continuously focus on
patient-centered care to advance surgical outcomes by empowering surgeons with our high-quality technology
solutions.

Through the union of excellence in hardware (our innovative orthopedics product portfolio), software
and delivery of best-in-class patient care, we believe we are at the forefront of technological advancements in the
orthopedics industry.

The following fundamental themes characterize our Company:

- _Pioneering vision: We believe we are at the forefront of innovation in orthopedics. In 2002, we developed_
the Shoulder Modular Replacement (“SMR”) system, which is one of the leading modular shoulder platforms
on the market. We are pioneers in 3D printed implants, with decades of experience underlying our proprietary
TT technology. In 2015, together with a team of surgeons, we developed the Physica system, an innovative
total knee replacement concept.

-----

- _Global footprint and broad customer base: We have a global footprint, serving customers in 51 countries_
through 26 subsidiaries with a strong local management team and distributors covering the remaining 25
countries. Our broad customer base allows us to capitalize on opportunities in strategic local markets and
proactively anticipate evolving customer and patient demands.

Our headquarters are located in Villanova di San Daniele del Friuli in north-eastern Italy. We operate
two state-of-the-art production sites in Italy (Villanova di San Daniele and Segesta). In addition, the new ProMade
Point-of-Care (“PoC”) Center, operated by us on the Hospital for Special Surgery (“HSS”) main campus in New
York City, became operational in March 2021. Our innovative orthopedics portfolio, expertise in design and
engineering, and excellence in advanced manufacturing, combined with our agile operations and global
commercial reach, have established us as a key player in the orthopedic joint replacement market. Based on
management data (including industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management
consulting company), we have a strong presence in the global shoulder segment, with approximately 3-5% market
share, ranking among the top six companies with respect to market position globally in 2019. We are the top
shoulder player in Italy (approximately 37% market share in 2019) and were ranked among the top five companies
in Germany, the UK, France and Australia and among the top ten companies in the U.S.in 2019.

We have a team of approximately 140 professionals (as of December 31, 2021) focusing on research,
product and software design, often in partnership with renowned orthopedic surgeons at our Research &
Innovation (“R&I”) Center and Advanced Laboratory for Testing & Analysis (“ATLAs”), at our headquarters
and at our Digital Center of Excellence in Knoxville, Tennessee. In March 2021, we opened our ProMade PoC
Center on the main campus of the HSS in New York City, which we believe is the first design and 3D printing
(also known as “additive manufacturing”) facility for custom complex implants in a hospital setting. Additionally,
our standard practice is to seek patent protection for the intellectual property technical solutions relevant to our
business, and as of September 30, 2022, we owned 157 patents and had 155 patent applications pending.

The figure below illustrates certain of our products and solutions grouped by categories and geographies
and their contribution to our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.

**Product Mix** **Geographic Mix**

**Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

**_Industry Growth and Secular Trends_**

We operate in the large and global orthopedics market, which is characterized by historically resilient
and stable growth underpinned by favorable demographic and secular trends. We carry a broad product portfolio
of orthopedic implants, focusing on product lines that offer relatively higher value in terms of expected market
growth. We specifically focus on what we identify as high value-add products, namely products for the extremities
segment (shoulder and elbow), hip and knee “revision” implants (which replace existing implants, as opposed to
“primary,” i.e. first-time implants), ProMade custom solutions manufactured for revision and other complex
primary surgeries and Trabecular Titanium 3D printed devices.

We operate in the large and attractive global orthopedic implants market, underpinned by strong
fundamentals, valued at approximately $45.5 billion in 2019 and project to grow even further. According to

109


-----

industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company, the
shoulder, knee and hip implants market in our key markets, the U.S., Italy, Germany, the UK, Australia, Japan
and France totaled approximately $13.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately
1.0% to 1.5% from 2019 to 2025.

###### Shoulder, Knee and Hip Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2007-2025 ($Bn)

_Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._

Our market is expected to continue benefitting from favorable structural tailwinds, including the
following:

 - **Demographic factors: Demographic factors such as aging of the global population, increased levels of**
chronic diseases, rising levels of obesity worldwide (affecting younger and younger populations) and active
lifestyles, particularly in advancing years, as well as sports-related and other injuries, lead to greater wear
on joints and higher rates of degenerative diseases, which tends to support greater spending in the orthopedics
market.

 - **COVID-19 backlog: Due to the characteristics of a “product of need” and the importance of orthopedic**
devices in treating patients suffering from injuries to bones and joints or supporting soft tissue injuries, the
global orthopedic market historically has proven to be resilient, including during the recent global financial
crisis and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significantly, there is pent-up demand in the global
orthopedics market as a result of the postponement of a large number of non-emergency and elective
procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe will contribute to increased spending in the
orthopedics market over the medium-term until the demand for non-urgent procedures has been absorbed.

 - **Growth in high-value segments: The extremities market (particularly for shoulder implants, which is one**
of our core product lines), which generally benefits from higher profitability as compared to other segments,
is growing faster than the overall global orthopedic implants market, with joint prostheses being the fastest
growing segment at a CAGR of approximately 5.0% to 5.5% between 2019 and 2025 (according to industry
and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company) and some key
geographical areas growing even faster. For instance, the orthopedic implant market for joints in Australia,
one of our strongest geographies in APAC, was forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 3.0% to 3.5% between
2019 and 2025 (according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management
consulting company).

**_Innovation, Research and Development_**

The development, manufacturing and sales of our proprietary products has changed and, we expect, will
continue to change over time and, depending on the magnitude of such changes, can impact our profitability.

We invest substantial time, effort and financial resources into research and development to maintain a
rich pipeline of innovative and marketable proprietary products. We undertake research and development

-----

spending across all product lines, with a particular focus on shoulder, knee and elbow products, as well as our
own custom-made ProMade unit. As of December 31, 2021, our research and development team consisted of
approximately 140 professionals with long-lasting experience and educational degrees in mechanical engineering,
biomedical, aerospace, materials science, and physics.

We believe that we are at the forefront of medical device technology, having invested €15.3 million,
€16.3 million and €18.0 million in R&D (capitalized and expensed) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020
and 2021, respectively. Our research and development initiatives have targeted growth in high-value segments
(i.e., segments within the market which benefit from relatively higher profitability) involving significant
complexity, contributing to our strong profit margins for the periods under review. For the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 55.4%, 54.4% and 54.0% of our revenue were derived from what we refer to as high
value-add products involving significant technical complexity, namely:

    - products for the high-growth extremities segment, which, for the year ended December 31, 2021
represented 35.3% of our revenue (excluding TT 3D printed products and custom implants, which
are accounted for under a different product line), compared to 34.1% for the year ended December
31, 2020 and 34.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019; the shoulder market is projected to grow
at a CAGR of 5.0% to 5.5% from 2019 to 2025, according to industry and market data elaborated in
September 2021 by a global management consulting company;

    - hip and knee revision implants, which, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we estimate
represented 6.8% of our revenue (excluding TT 3D printed products and custom implants),
compared to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 7.6% for the year ended December
31, 2019; based on our experience in the market, this type of product is generally priced 30% higher
than primary implants due to its inherent complexity;

    - custom implants, which represented 1.7% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 1.5% for the year ended December
31, 2019; this market, in which we hold a leading position thanks to our ProMade products, is
projected to grow at a CAGR of 8% to 12% 2019 and 2025, according to industry and market data
analyzed by a global management consulting company; and

    - our TT 3D printed differentiated technology, which generates higher profit margins compared to our
standard products and represented 11.6% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 10.5% for the year ended December
31, 2019.

We plan to continue growing our presence in these segments. Our differentiated 3D printed TT implants
position us to benefit from the shift to outpatient clinics and ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”) (mainly present
in the United States) for less complex, routine orthopedic procedures, a trend that has been further accelerated by
the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe we are well prepared for the shift toward ASCs and we are in the process
of developing pilot offerings with ASC-based surgeons and managers (for example, the streamlining of trays (part
of our instrument sets) and co-marketing initiatives).

**_COVID-19 Pandemic and Recovery, Macroeconomic Condition_**

The years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 were marked by the impact of COVID-19.

Having experienced strong year-on-year revenue growth in 2019, our revenue continued to grow strongly
during the first two months of 2020 as compared to the corresponding prior-year period, until our operations were
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic mostly in terms of a decrease in revenue resulting from postponement of
surgeries, particularly in public health structures, especially in those countries where healthcare is managed by
local governments (e.g., Eastern Europe). Elective surgeries decreased in the early stage of the pandemic (March
and April 2020), as hospitals were required to reserve intensive care beds for COVID-19 patients. When the first
wave of the pandemic subsided during the summer of 2020, we experienced a significant sales recovery, with
third quarter sales outperforming those of the same period in 2019. However, as a result of the second wave of
the pandemic, which coincided with the onset of autumn, hospitals were forced to reduce (if not to fully suspend)
elective surgeries in order to handle the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This caused a further slowdown in our
sales, although more limited that at the beginning of 2020. This slowdown had a greater impact in Italy than in
the other countries in which we operate, mainly due to the different approaches to addressing the pandemic in
various countries. We continued to be largely affected by these lockdowns until the end of the first half of 2021.

111


-----

Partially offsetting the negative impact of the contraction in sales, our management implemented a
structural review of costs, maximizing the transition to digital, cancelling virtually all in-person trade shows,
workshops and sector conventions, and capitalizing on the opportunity offered by the critical juncture to adopt a
new model which benefits our profitability and contributes to our employees’ work-life balance.

Where possible, we benefited from employment support measures introduced by local governments in
response to the COVID-19 emergency, such as the dedicated furlough scheme (Cassa Integrazione Guadagni)
adopted for 18 weeks between March and July of 2020 in Italy, which significantly supplemented the government
measures and allowed us to fully reimburse our employees for compensation which was temporarily reduced
during the period. In addition, our management team contributed to these efforts by accepting a reduction of their
salaries in solidarity with furlough scheme adopted in 2020 and 2021. Between January and June 2021, we took
advantage of an additional furlough scheme in Italy (Cassa Integrazione Guadagni) and reimbursed 50% of
affected employees’ salary reductions during the period. Lastly, following COVID-19-related government
initiatives, some of our branches received medium-term subsidized loans during the year that have now all been
repaid.

While our revenue decreased 12.9% from €222.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to €194.0
million in the year ended December 31, 2020, it later increased 9.7% to €212.8 million in the year ended December
31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The strong performance in the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 reflects surgery volumes recovering to, or otherwise surpassing, pre-COVID-19 pandemic
levels in most of the geographies in which we operate, and increasing orders following postponements and
cancellations of surgeries. Our continued return to normality post-COVID-19 has been further supported by the
demand for our products resulting from the backlog of non-emergency and elective procedures which were
postponed, as, among other factors, (i) hospital capacity and healthcare resources were significantly re-routed to
deal with patients suffering from COVID-19, (ii) many hospitals and healthcare providers placed restrictions on
the number and type of non-emergency and elective procedures performed at their facilities, and (iii) many
candidates for such procedures preferred to minimize their exposure to clinical settings for fear of contracting
COVID-19. For example, as of February 2022, the British National Health Service estimated that 6.0 million
people were on the waiting list for planned service delivery, up from 4.4 million prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Non-urgent medical procedures in the United States were also significantly disrupted, with providers in some
parts of the country, such as Texas and Florida, banning elective surgeries in 2020.

We believe there is significant pent-up demand for our products as a result of the lockdowns that
restricted elective procedures across our markets. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we estimate such
backlog to amount to over €60.0 million of sales for our business over the medium-term. As the capacity of
healthcare facilities and providers returns to, or exceeds, pre-COVID levels, we believe this backlog will be
absorbed over the next few years, resulting in a de-risking of a significant portion of our future revenue growth.

During the pandemic, we continued to invest in the growth of our business. We purchased a significant
amount of instrument sets (totaling €32.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021) and
manufactured inventory while continuing spending on the development of new products (thereby increasing our
working capital), which we believe will yield customer conversions and further growth in the business. As a result,
we believe that we are well-invested and prepared to tackle the post-COVID-19 rebound of sales, with resources
readily available to be deployed into the market. We are already seeing the benefits of our preparedness to take
advantage of this backlog, with revenue increasing by 16.2% to €180.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 from €155.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (despite the continued
impact of COVID-19 on APAC, which is still recovering from ongoing governmental COVID-19 responses
(particularly in Australia, New Zealand and Korea) and a continued slow-down in elective surgeries as a result).
We expect our Net Working Capital to normalize over the medium-term, resulting in a trend towards pre-COVID19 levels of Net Working Capital, and in particular of days sales outstanding (“DSO”) and days inventory
outstanding (“DIO”), as we are able to sell inventory (and quicken the receipt of payments from our customers
post-pandemic) which we continued to procure during the pandemic in expectation of the post-pandemic sales
rebound. See “—Net Working Capital.”

Supported by our continued focus on new customer conversion, sales force expansion and new
instrument sets deployment, we also gained additional market share (as estimated by comparing our revenue
growth against publicly available reporting of top-line sales figures of our peers), growing above our peers in the
market (recording revenue growth of 12.7% between the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022 as
compared to our top four competitors’ top-line sales figures growing at 6.0%, 6.5%, 1.2% and 3.5% over the same
period, respectively). Moreover, we experienced improving Cash Conversion of 72.0% for the nine months ended

112


-----

September 30, 2022, compared to 47.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, supported by an overall
decrease in Net Working Capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Demand for our products and our cost base may also be influenced by general macroeconomic economic
conditions. In times of economic downturn, we could experience lower demand and a more challenging market
environment for our product offerings resulting from a general decline in consumer and business confidence,
increased unemployment and difficulties experienced by third party payors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_Our Industry and Business—Our business may be negatively affected by changes in international economic_
_conditions.”_

Nevertheless, as of the date of this offering memorandum we have not been materially affected by the
ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022. We control a significant proportion of
our value chain, from machining to finishing, coating, clean room and packaging, allowing for efficient cost
management and production flexibility. We source a limited number of products from dependable third-parties
located primarily in Italy, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, including certain raw materials (principally
titanium, titanium powders, polyethylene and ceramic) and ancillary semi-finished components and as of the date
of this offering memorandum, have not experienced supply chain disruptions in 2022. We have benefited from a
strengthening of the U.S. dollar since the invasion of Ukraine, due to a large portion of our revenues being
denominated in U.S. Dollars and a majority of our costs being incurred in euro. Our energy and power supply
(industrial) costs have also not been a material component of our cost of production, amounting to €2.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and €1.2 million, €1.3 million and €1.4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We also maintain a partial ability to pass on raw material cost
inflation to customers (primarily third-party distributors).

**_Geographical and diverse product mix_**

The mix of product categories and countries in which our products are sold has changed and, we expect,
will continue to change over time and, depending on the magnitude of such changes, can impact revenue and our
profitability. We have a global network which provides a footprint in the local markets where our subsidiaries are
present, offering proximity to the most attractive markets for the development of the healthcare sector and
potential patients, operating in five main geographical segments: Europe (excluding Italy), Italy, APAC, the
United States and the Rest of the World with sales in over 50 countries. Until the early 1990s, most of our revenue
was generated in Italy. Since then, we have grown and continue to grow the percentage of revenue generated
outside of Italy, with revenue generated in Italy decreasing from 21.4% of revenue in 2019 to 19.8% of revenue
in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 37.1% of revenue was generated in Europe (excluding Italy),
19.8% in Italy, 18.0% in APAC, 16.6% in the United States and 8.4% in the Rest of the World.

We intend to further penetrate the high-value U.S. market by expanding our existing product offering,
which is currently focused on our higher-priced and higher-margin shoulder implants. To further grow our market
share in the United States, we intend to further expand our product offering and address the evolutionary trend
toward new ambulatory surgery centers, and the demand for cost-efficient outpatient procedures for less complex,
routine orthopedic needs. The U.S. market is generally characterized by higher prices for healthcare products as
compared to other geographies such as Europe, and as such, we are able to charge higher prices for our products
in the region, contributing to higher margins. We believe that further expansion in the U.S. will therefore be
margin-accretive and beneficial to our results.

The tables below set forth breakdowns of revenue by geography and product line for the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, and as a percentage
of our revenue for the relevant periods:

We have a comprehensive and diversified product portfolio covering full joint replacements, large joint
revision and primary implants, as well as innovative implants for orthopedic joint reconstruction and fixation
based on leading technology (including 3D printing), complete extremities solutions and complementary fixation
and other devices. Our portfolio includes four main product lines: extremities, knee, hip and other products.
Moreover, our ProMade product line permits us to provide custom implants for patients with complex orthopedic
needs. Our strategy is focused on high value-adding products, including extremities products.

Our revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December
31, 2020, after an initial decrease in the year ended December 31, 2020 attributable to the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, during which many healthcare providers and hospitals deferred or otherwise limited non-emergency
surgeries. Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased as compared to our revenue for
the nine months ended September 30, 2021 showing a continued post-COVID-19 rebound, especially in Europe
and the United States. Despite this latest revenue growth trend, we operate in a competitive industry and,
depending on the product and geography, face varying degrees of pressure to reduce our selling prices, and we
expect such pricing pressure to continue in the future. While average selling prices for hips and knees have
generally been declining globally at low-single-digit annual rates, we believe we can offset these declines by
focusing on extremities, where pricing is more stable (particularly, shoulder products), by tilting our geographical
sales mix towards high-margin countries (such as the U.S) and through product innovation across the portfolio.
Innovation is primarily responsible for an underlying shift from more commoditized products (like standard hip
and knee implants) to more specialized products made using advanced technologies and materials like our
proprietary Trabecular Titanium (“TT”) technology. These factors directly translate into higher average selling
prices levels as well as an increase in after-surgery service.

Given our strong position in niche markets such as shoulder and revision surgeries, where price pressure
is expected to be less intense, as well as our proven innovation capabilities, differentiated TT technology, and
recent acquisitions of high-profile products, we believe we are favorably positioned within the current pricing
environment. Accordingly, we endeavor to continue to innovate and introduce new products. We rely on a steady
pipeline of new products in various stages of concept, design and market release. As of December 31, 2021, we
had 10 products in the concept stage (four extremities products, two knee products, one hip product and three
digital products) and 21 products in the development stage (10 extremities products, six knee products, two hip
product and three digital products). Four products were released in the market/launched in 2022, and eight
products are expected to be in 2023. In addition to the traditional product lines, we also offer bespoke products
across all product lines which are consolidated in ProMade. ProMade implants are designed and manufactured
using computer aided design and additive manufacturing technologies for exclusive patient needs with high level
of surgical complexity across hip, shoulder and knee. Custom-made products are required in severe and complex
cases like cancer patients, revision and especially in re-revision operations since the removal of primary and
revision implants can cause bone and tissue damage, making more sophisticated and complex implants necessary.
The development of customized implants and instrument sets require advanced research and development
capability, resulting in higher price points and ultimately higher profit margins. We do not currently report revenue
attributable to ProMade separately, but we account for such revenue under the main product line the custom-made
product belongs to.

**_Acquisitions and strategic collaborations_**

Historically, we have increased our sales primarily through organic growth, through the development
and marketing of new innovative products which are developed in-house. However, from time to time, we have
also pursued strategic acquisitions, collaborations and other business combinations which have resulted in the
growth of our business through benefits from synergies, cost savings and an expanded product portfolio, resulting
in increased revenue and other income. We have historically entered into and expect to continue to pursue such
strategic acquisitions that complement or enhance our existing products. We have sought to strategically invest in
niche specialty products where attractive opportunities arise that could complement our organic growth strategy
and/or complete or enhance our product portfolio in key geographies and where we believe we have significant

expertise in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions while remaining focused on our financial
performance.

_TechMah Medical LLC_

In September 2018, our U.S.-based subsidiary, Lima USA acquired TechMah, a company that specializes
in software for medical devices and focuses on digital technologies for orthopedic surgery. The acquisition of
TechMah enabled the addition of software expertise to our own 3D printing know-how. In particular, we funded
TechMah and supported the development of its digital solutions dedicated to orthopedic surgery.

TechMah did not generate revenue in the three-year period from 2018 to 2020, due to its investments in
the development of digital technology for the shoulder guidance, which received clearance from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in March 2021. The shoulder guidance product is currently in the Controlled
Release phase.

TechMah was fully consolidated from the year ended December 31, 2018 using the anticipated
acquisition method. The consideration for the acquisition amounted to $38.0 million (€33.2 million at EUR/USD
exchange rate as of December 31, 2018), structured as follows:

    - initial cash consideration of $7.0 million (€6.1 million at the EUR/USD exchange rate as of
December 31, 2018);

    - deferred cash consideration (in the form of capital contributions) of $8.0 million (€6.9 million at the
EUR/USD exchange rate as of December 31, 2018), paid in instalments in 2018, 2019 and 2020;

    - further contingent consideration in the form of cash and shares of the Issuer, paid upon the
completion of certain milestones, amounting to $10.9 million (€9.5 million at the EUR/USD
exchange rate as of December 31, 2018);

    - further contingent consideration in the form of cash and shares of the Issuer, paid upon the
completion of certain performance milestones (i.e. the number of surgical operations performed),
amounting to $12.2 million (€10.6 million at the EUR/USD exchange rate as of December 31, 2018).

As of September 30, 2022, outstanding contingent consideration relating to the TechMah Acquisition
amounted to €8.8 million.

The following table shows how the consideration for the acquisition of TechMah was determined at the
date of the acquisition agreement:

**(€’000)*** **5 September 2018**

**Initial consideration...........................................................................................................................** **6,114**

**Deferred consideration settled in cash.............................................................................................** **6,920**

Consideration (cash and shares) tied to achievement of milestones ................................................... 9,502

Consideration tied to the number of surgical operations performed ................................................... 10,633

**Contingent consideration** .................................................................................................................. **20,135**

**Total consideration** ............................................................................................................................ **33,170**

(*) Values converted in Euro at the EUR/USD exchange rate as of December 31, 2018.

The consideration recognized under current and non-current financial liabilities amounts to €13.4 million
at December 31, 2021, €21.3 million at December 31, 2020 and €23.3 million at December 31, 2019. It is updated
at each reporting date for the effects of the year-on-year calculation of the contingent consideration.

_Hospital for Special Surgery_

Our U.S.-based subsidiary, Lima USA Inc., signed an agreement with the Hospital for Special Surgery
(the “HSS”) in January 2019 for the production of implants on hospital grounds. Jointly with HSS, we announced
the creation of the first additive manufacturing 3D printing facility for custom complex implants in a hospital
setting. We opened the ProMade Point-of-Care (“PoC”) Center in March 2021 at the HSS’s main campus in New
York City, for the 3D printing of custom complex implants in a hospital setting. The first surgery using 3D printed
implants manufactured at the PoC was carried out in April 2021.

The collaboration with the HSS did not generate revenue in the three-year period, as we focused on
creating the ProMade PoC Center. The collaboration however enabled us to lay the groundwork to strengthen and
expand ProMade, identified as a high value added product, particularly in the United States which we consider
one of the most profitable markets. The collaboration and partnership with a world-leading orthopedic center also
allowed us to once again distinguish our company as a pioneer of innovation in the orthopedic field.

**_Investments_**

In order to support our leadership positions in our markets, we are required to continually develop new
products and improve existing products. Our Capital Expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020
and 2021 amounted to €38.5 million, €47.0 million and €37.0 million, respectively, and amounted to €37.6 million
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.

During the period under review, we made a proactive decision to sustain investment in our business to
foster growth acceleration post-pandemic. These expenditures have left us well-invested, with sufficient inventory
and capacity to capitalize on the post-pandemic rebound in sales activity. We purchased a significant amount of
instrument sets (totaling €32.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021) and manufactured
inventory while continuing spending on the development of new products (thereby increasing our working
capital), which we believe will yield customer conversions and further growth in the business.

We believe there is significant pent-up demand for our products as a result of the lockdowns that
restricted elective procedures across our markets. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we estimate such
backlog to amount to over €60.0 million of sales for our business over the medium-term. We expect that our
investments position us to benefit from the short-term rebound in procedures due to clearing of the backlog from
deferred surgeries during the COVID-19-related shutdowns and further expect our Capital Expenditures to
normalize at a lower level over the medium-term. We are already seeing the benefits of our preparedness to take
advantage of this backlog, with revenue increasing by 16.2% to €180.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 from €155.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (despite the continued
impact of COVID-19 on APAC, which is still recovering from ongoing governmental COVID-19 responses
(particularly in Australia, New Zealand and Korea) and a continued slow-down in elective surgeries as a result).

Our Capital Expenditures amounted to €122.5 million between 2019 and 2021, of which (i) €47.4 million
was linked to investments in instrument sets (which we expect to drive incremental revenue), (ii) €36.0 million
was used on property, plant and equipment, primarily to expand production capacity via new production and
manufacturing machinery, including new 3D printing facilities and a grey room plant, (iii) €19.2 million was
linked to the TechMah acquisition between 2019 and 2021 and (iv) €19.9 million was related to expenditures on
other intangibles, comprising start-up and expansion costs, R&D, development and costs related to patents and
intellectual property rights not otherwise attributable to TechMah’s integrated end-to-end digital surgery platform
(“Smart SPACE”). For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our investments were aimed
at implementing further growth and classified as Growth Capital Expenditures (i.e., discretionary expenditures)
while the remaining 20% consisted of maintenance investments and classified as Maintenance Capital
Expenditures, in line with approximately 80% and 20% for the year ended December 31, 2020. In the medium
term, we expect to benefit from our previous investments in our platform and to gradually reduce our Growth
Capital Expenditure as a result of the long life of the instruments sets deployed and the expected increase in turn
per sets. As such, we expect our yearly Maintenance Capital Expenditures over the medium-term to amount to
approximately €5-8 million, in line with historical levels, and our yearly Growth Capital Expenditures to remain
in the range of 5-10% of sales (with Growth Capital Expenditures trending towards the lower end of this range
assuming the completion of our discretionary expansion of production capacity at our Villanova di San Daniele
site in 2024, including a distribution center and additional manufacturing plant capacity).

Part of our targeted investment approach is accelerating growth and increasing handling efficiency
through management of instrument sets. Our total capital expenditures in instruments sets amounted to €14.9
million, €17.4 million and €15.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively,
and amounted to €14.0 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. We believe investment in
instrument sets is a key element to increase sales in the orthopedic industry. We design and outsource the purchase
of instrument sets that we supply surgeons on a consignment basis with our prostheses. Different instrument sets
are developed and supplied with our various products and product lines. Investing in our bespoke instrument sets
differentiates our products and services from our competitors, and we believe enhances our relationships with
surgeons. We believe that the supply of our instrument sets to surgeons and hospitals has a positive impact on our
sales.

**_Exchange Rate Trends_**

The presentation currency for our Consolidated Financial Statements is the euro. Although our reporting
currency is euros, 49.4% of our revenue was generated in euros as a result of our global sales approach, and 50.6%
of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than euros for the year ended December 31, 2021, in particular
U.S. dollars (16.6%), Japanese yen (5.8%), Australian dollars (5.8%) and pounds sterling (5.3%). In connection
with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, the results of operations and financial position of
each of our consolidated subsidiaries, which are initially prepared in each subsidiary’s functional currency, are
translated into euro. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate at the end of the relevant reporting
period, and income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year/period (as applicable).
Specifically, we are subject to currency risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than subsidiaries’
functional currency, thus affecting profit or loss for the year (transaction risk), as well as the currency risk resulting
from the translation of subsidiaries’ financial statements in currencies other than euro, affecting our consolidated
profit or loss for the year and consolidated equity (translation risk).

Certain of our subsidiaries are located in Australia, Japan, the UK and the United States, whose functional
currencies are the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, respectively.
Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates of these currencies against the euro from one period (as applicable)
to the next impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position and, depending on the magnitude
of these fluctuations, could obscure underlying trends that would have been apparent if our Consolidated Financial
Statements had been prepared on a constant currency basis. To the extent that such subsidiaries have a reporting
currency other than the euro, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our Consolidated Financial Statements
may be greater. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Industry and Business—We are exposed to currency
_exchange and translation risks, which may reduce our operating results.”_

**Explanation of Key Items of Income Statement**

Below is a summary description of the key elements of the line items of our income statement.

_Revenue: Revenue includes the consideration we account for the products we offer. Our portfolio covers_
large joint revision and primary implants, as well as complete extremities solutions and complementary fixation
and other devices. We operate through four main product lines: (1) extremities, (2) knee, (3) hip, and (4) fixation
and other, and we additionally sell custom made products across all product lines. We recognize revenue upon
the transfer of control of the promised goods or delivery of services to the relevant customer and is measured to
the extent that it is probably that economic benefits (which can be measured reliably) will flow to the group.
Revenue is adjusted for any discounts and volume rebates provided to customers.

_Other revenues and income: Other revenues and income include primarily services recharges, capital_
gains, lease income and grants.

_Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods:_ Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods
comprises of expenditures on materials, consumables, supplies and goods, consisting primarily of: purchases of
semi-finished products and finished goods, raw materials, packaging, processing materials and other items used
to manufacture our products. Additionally, such expenses impact both our total revenues and income as well as
assets recorded on our balance sheet, as such expenses predominantly comprise the cost of in-house capitalized
tangible assets, mainly instrument sets. For such reason, cost of materials on revenue for the periods under review
should be considered jointly with changes in work-in-progress, semi-finished and finished goods and with the
increase recorded in assets relating to the in-house production of instrument sets. Expenses are recognized when
goods and services are sold or consumed during the year or by systemic allocation, or else when it is not possible
to identify the timing of their future use.

_Services: Services comprises primarily (i) commissions and charges based on a percentage of accrued_
commissions up to the ceiling set by Enasarco, paid into the Enasarco pension fund (the supplementary fund to
which commercial agents and representatives must register (“Enasarco”)), (ii) consultant-outsourced processing,
analysis and administrative services, (iii) insurance, maintenance, utilities, travel costs and workshop costs, (iv)
transport costs and (v) royalty fees relating to the use of third-party patents.

_Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods: Change in work-in-progress,_
semi-finished products and finished goods refers to charges related to the change in inventory of such items.

117


-----

_Personnel expenses: Personnel costs comprise the expenses related to wages and salaries, social security_
contributions, post-employee benefits and other related costs.

_Amortization and depreciation: Amortization and depreciation includes depreciation of right-of-use_
assets and comprises the amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and
depreciation of leased assets.

_Bad debt provision and other impairment losses: Bad debt provision includes the accrual for net_
impairment losses on trade receivables recognized pursuant to IFRS 9. Other impairment losses refer to
impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment which are not expected to be reversed
at the date of preparation of the relevant financial statements.

_Other operating costs: Other operating costs comprise primarily of duty charges, gifts and donations,_
risk provisions, and other costs.

_Internal work capitalized: Internal work capitalized consists of increases in (i) property, plant and_
equipment for capitalization of equipment and property, plant and equipment for internal work, which both refer
to the capitalization of equipment built in-house and (ii) intangible assets for capitalization of sundry costs which
refers to the capitalization of internal and external costs incurred for product development projects.

_Financial income: Financial income primarily consists of interest income._

_Financial expense: Financial expense primarily consists of interest expense (including amortized costs)_
on financial instruments, such as loans, bonds and other borrowings, as well as expenses for certain fair value
adjustments to liabilities, commitment fees and expenses on lease liabilities per IFRS 16.

_Income taxes: Income taxes comprise the sum of current and deferred taxes and are determined on the_
basis of applicable legislation, but do not include items recognized directly in equity.

**_Comparison of results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021_**

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €25.1 million, or 16.2%, to €180.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2022 from €155.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily as a result of a strong
post-COVID-19 rebound in sales, especially in Europe (including Italy) and the United States. We believe the
fundamental drivers of our business remained unchanged even during the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. continued
demand due to demographic factors and the role of orthopedic devices as a “product of need” with inelastic
demand. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we continued to take advantage of the backlog in
demand resulting from delayed procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued to focus on new
customer conversion, sales force expansion and the deployment of new instrument sets, which allowed us to
increase our revenues (recording significant organic growth as compared to our revenues for the equivalent preCOVID-19 period in 2019) and capitalize on the opportunity to gain market share.

We experienced positive sales performance in most of our sales geographies, with Europe (including
Italy) leading such growth and recording a 19.9% increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. We also recorded a strong rebound in U.S. revenue, with
revenue growing by 20.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2021. Rest of the World sales also increased by 18.9% as compared to the prior-year period,
primarily driven by a doubling of our sales in Brazil. Our sales in APAC decreased slightly, still recovering from
ongoing governmental COVID-19 responses (particularly in Australia, New Zealand and Korea) and a continued
slow-down in elective surgeries as a result. Notably, we recorded organic revenue growth in all of our product
lines, with the largest percentage increase attributable to our knee segment, complemented by continued strong
organic growth in our extremities segment.

The following tables set out the breakdown of revenue by geography and by product line for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022:

Other revenue and income increased by €0.8 million, or 29.6%, to €3.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 compared to €2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in revenue from service recharges linked to the rise in turnover and sales, as well as
an increase of other income and other revenue.

_Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods_

Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods increased by €2.4 million, or 6.0%, to €42.3 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to €39.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2021. This increase was driven primarily by our higher sales for the period, resulting in higher purchases of

finished goods, as well as increased purchases of raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods to rebalance
inventories.

Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods, as a percentage of revenue, represented 23.4% and
25.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

30, 2022 compared to €47.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, driven by higher turnover
and processing fees and an increase in transport costs as a result of higher sales and management remuneration in
connection with the step-down of our former CEO Luigi Ferrari.

Services, as a percentage of revenue, represented 33.4% and 30.3% for the nine months ended September
30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

_Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods_

Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods increased by €0.4 million to €2.3

ended September 30, 2022 compared to €23.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This
increase was driven primarily by the increased amortization of intangible assets (with such assets being put into
service in 2021) related to the acquisition of TechMah, mainly due to the impact of foreign exchange movements.

Amortization and depreciation, as a percentage of revenue, represented 14.5% and 15.2% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

_Other impairment losses_

Other impairment losses increased by €0.8 million, to €0.9 million for the nine months ended September

ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

_Other operating costs_

Other operating costs increased by €0.3 million, to €1.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2022 compared to €0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily

_Financial income_

Financial income increased by €14.6 million to €19.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2022 compared to €5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, mainly due to increased exchange
gains and financial income from the adjustment of liabilities to fair value in the nine months ended September 30,

September 30, 2022 from €46.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was
attributable to increased sales as compared to the prior period, which more than offset a return to pre-COVID-19
levels of spending in medical education and marketing.

Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased by 3.6 percentage points, to 26.3% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 from 29.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease was attributable to
increased spending in medical education and marketing in line with pre-COVID-19 levels, as well as increased
travel costs (albeit not at pre-COVID-19 levels due to the increased prevalence of remote/digital events across the
industry).

_Revenue_

Revenue increased overall by €18.8 million, or 9.7%, to €212.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2021, from €194.0 million of the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenue, despite the impact of
novel COVID-19 strains, was driven by strong double-digit organic growth in our Italian, European and Latin
American (captured within our Rest of the World geographical segment) geographies, and to a lesser extent,
growth in our United States and APAC geographies, as sales rebounded globally post-pandemic as compared to
the year ended December 31, 2020 notwithstanding ongoing COVID-19 governmental responses and a continued
slow-down in elective surgeries in APAC.

We believe the fundamental drivers of our business remained unchanged even during the COVID-19
pandemic, i.e. continued demand due to demographic factors and the role of orthopedic devices as a “product of
need” with inelastic demand. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we began to take advantage of the
backlog in demand resulting from delayed procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued to focus on
new customer conversion, sales force expansion and the deployment of new instrument sets, which allowed us to
increase our revenues (beyond our revenues for the equivalent pre-COVID-19 period in 2019) and capitalize on
the opportunity to gain market share. 2021 also marked a return to more normal operations, with the continuation
of a number of in-person medical conferences and training events.

Despite the material impact to our sales in the first few months of 2021, revenue recovered significantly
in the second half of the year as a result of accelerating vaccination efforts in our sales geographies and returned
to pre-COVID-19 levels. Our organic revenue growth for the period was driven by significantly increased demand
in Europe (including Italy). Notably, we recorded revenue growth in all of our product lines, with the largest
percentage increase attributable to our high-margin extremities segment.

The following tables set out the breakdown of revenue by geography and by product line, for the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2021:

**Revenue by Geographic Segment**

**Year ended December 31,**

**2020** **2021**

(in millions of €, except as percentage of revenue)

Italy ................................................ 37.0 19.1% 42.2 19.8%

Europe (excluding Italy) ................ 63.9 32.9% 79.0 37.1%

APAC............................................. 38.1 19.7% 38.4 18.0%

**Revenue ........................................** **194.0** **100%** **212.8** **100%**

_Other revenue and income_

Other revenue and income decreased by €0.8 million, or 17.2%, to €4.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 compared to €4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to significantly
lower government contributions in the year ended December 31, 2021, as opposed to contributions and other
subsidies paid by most local governments sustaining businesses and employment during the peak of the
COVID-19 pandemic in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods_

Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods decreased by €6.6 million, or 11.0%, to €53.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven
primarily by lower purchases of raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods as a result of lower sales volumes,
and by the purchase of components related to the deployment of instrument sets in the year ended December 31,
2020. We were additionally able to decrease expenditures on raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods for
the period due to increased existing inventory as a result of our prudent decision to continue investment during
the year ended December 31, 2020, which positioned us to take advantage of the expected post-pandemic backlog
of demand for our products.

Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods, as a percentage of revenue, represented 25.1% and
31.0% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

_Services_

Services increased by €7.7 million, or 12.4%, to €69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
compared to €62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to stable travel and marketing
expenses resulting from the maintenance of cost savings initiatives put in place during the pandemic. These
savings were offset by higher commercial, consulting and outsourcing costs and sales commissions, which grew
in line with increased revenues.

In particular, (i) Enasarco pension commissions and charges increased by €1.2 million, or 5.2%, to €23.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020;
(ii) consultant-outsourced processing, analysis and administrative services increased by €4.3 million, or 34.4%,
to €17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €12.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2020; (iii) insurance, maintenance, utilities, travel costs and workshop costs increased by €1 million, or 8.7%,
to €12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €11.3 million for the year ended December
31, 2020; (iv) transport costs increased by €0.3 million, or 5.2%, to €5.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2021 compared to €5.1 million for the year ended December 31,2020; and (v) royalty fees relating to the use of
third-party patents decreased by €0.1 million, or 4.4%, to €0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
compared to €1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Services, as a percentage of revenue, represented 32.9% and 32.1% for the year ended December 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively.

_Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods_

Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods decreased by €9.8 million, or
82.7%, to €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to €11.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the post-COVID rebound in sales which occurred during
the course of the year ended December 31, 2021.

Change in-work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods, as a percentage of revenue,
represented 1.0% and 6.1% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

_Personnel expenses_

Personnel expenses decreased by €2.4 million, or 3.8%, to €60.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 compared to €63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the delay of new hirings,
lower bonuses and the partial maintaining, especially at the beginning, of cost saving measures for COVID-19.

Personnel expenses represented only 28.6% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared
to 32.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Amortization and depreciation_

Amortization and depreciation increased by €2.9 million, or 9.8%, to €32.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 compared to €29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Amortization and
depreciation for the period consisted of (i) property, plant and equipment line items totaling €20.5 million,
comprising land and buildings, plant and equipment, industrial and commercial equipment and other assets (ii)
amortization of intangible assets amounting to €7.4 million; and (iii) depreciation of leased assets of €4.6 million.
The €2.9 million increase compared to the prior period was driven primarily by the amortization of intangible
assets (with such assets being put into service in 2021) related to the acquisition of TechMah.

Amortization and depreciation, as a percentage of revenue, represented 15.3% and 15.3% for the years
ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

_Bad debt provision_

Bad debt provision decreased by €0.2 million, or 33.5%, to €0.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 compared to €0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was the result of an
improved quality of the receivables portfolio and in turn, a lower provision for impairment losses.

Bad debt provision, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.2% and 0.3% for the years ended December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Other impairment losses decreased by €0.3 million, or 59.3%, to €0.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 compared to €0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was caused
by a reduced requirement to impair the value of intangible and tangible assets compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020.

Other impairment losses, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.1% and 0.3% for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

_Other operating costs_

Other operating costs decreased by €0.2 million, or 10.3%, to €1.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 compared to €1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven primarily by a decrease in other
miscellaneous operating fees and accruals costs.

Other operating costs, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.7% and 0.9% for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

_Internal work capitalized_

Internal work capitalized decreased by €2.2 million, or 11.7%, to €16.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 compared to €18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to
management’s focus on only deploying instrument sets in strategic markets to support a post-COVID sales
rebound.

Internal work capitalized, as a percentage of revenue, represented 7.6% and 9.5% for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

_Financial income_

Financial income increased by €4.8 million, or 158.9%, to €7.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2021, compared to €3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to a higher value of unrealized
exchange gains and fair value gains on deferred financial debt.

Financial income, as a percentage of revenue, represented 3.7% and 1.6% for the years ended December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

_Financial expenses_

Financial expenses decreased by €7.6 million, or 26.8%, to €20.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 compared to €28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to
lower realized and unrealized exchange losses.

Financial expenses, as a percentage of revenue, represented 9.8% and 14.6% for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

_Income tax benefit (expense)_

Income tax benefit decreased by €5.8 million, or 333.4%, to a loss of €4.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of €1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
This decrease was driven by both an increased amount of taxable income and a larger accrual of deferred taxes.

Income tax benefit, as a percentage of revenue, represented 1.9% and 0.9% for the years ended December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

_Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €11.4 million, or 22.1%, to €63.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 from €51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was attributable to increased
sales (including sales of high-margin products) as compared to the prior period (which was significantly impacted
by the COVID-19 pandemic), especially as a result of increased sales in the second half of the year as a result of
the lifting of lockdown measures and reduction of the COVID-19 pandemic in many of markets.

124


-----

Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 3.3 percentage points, to 29.6% for the year ended December
31, 2021 from 26.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was attributable to swift action taken
by management in advancing savings initiatives for the period, such as price negotiation initiatives and channel
cost savings that we implemented by lowering travel and medical conference costs during the COVID-19
pandemic, all of which contributed to our profitability.

**_Comparison of results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019_**

_Revenue_

Revenue decreased overall by €28.8 million, or 12.9%, to €194.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2020, from €222.8 million of the year ended December 31, 2019, heavily impacted by the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic, including mobility restrictions and lockdowns, but mainly disruptions of healthcare
systems globally primarily resulting in the postponement of a large number of non-emergency and elective
procedures, as, among other factors, (i) hospital capacity and healthcare resources were significantly rerouted to
deal with patients suffering from COVID-19, (ii) many hospitals and healthcare providers placed restrictions on
the number and type of non-emergency and elective procedures performed at their facilities, and (iii) many
candidates for such procedures preferred to minimize their exposure to clinical settings for fear of contracting
COVID-19.

We believe the fundamental drivers of our business remained unchanged even during the COVID-19
pandemic, i.e. continued demand due to demographic factors and the role of orthopedic devices as a “product of
need” with inelastic demand. We entered the year with strong revenue momentum, recording strong organic sales
growth in the first two months of 2020, and experienced an additional rebound in the summer months of 2020
when initial lockdowns were lifted in many of our sales geographies which was eventually offset by the
proliferation of the pandemic later in the year. We demonstrated earnings resilience during the COVID-19
pandemic, with our revenues declining by 12.9% between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, which
was less than the approximately 15% to 20% decline in our (weighted) key markets of the U.S., Italy, Germany,
the UK, Australia, Japan and France (according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a
global management consulting company). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we continued to focus on
new customer conversion, sales force expansion and the deployment of new instrument sets, which we believe
provided us with a base to increase our revenues in the periods that followed and capitalize on the opportunity to
gain market share.

The following tables set out the breakdown of revenue by geography and product line for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020:

**Revenue by Geographic Segment**

Raw materials, consumables, supplies and goods increased by €1.9 million, or 3.3%, to €60.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven
primarily by increased purchases of raw materials and semi-finished products, despite our decreased sales
volumes, and by the higher prices and irregularities of component purchases.

Services decreased by €12.4 million, or 16.6%, to €62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
compared to €74.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly due to lower commissions, fairs and
marketing events, as well as travel expenses due to restrictions set about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In particular, (i) Enasarco pension commissions and charges decreased by €3.6 million, or 13.8%, to
€22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €26.1 million for the year ended December 31,

80.1%, to €11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €6.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the increase in inventory in the year ended December 31,
2020 as compared to the prior period due to decreased sales during the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a buildup
of inventory.

Change in work-in-progress, semi-finished products and finished goods, as a percentage of revenue,
represented 6.1% and 3.0% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

_Amortization and depreciation_

Amortization and depreciation decreased by €4.2 million, or 12.5%, to €29.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 compared to €33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Amortization and
depreciation for the period consisted of (i) property, plant and equipment line items totaling €20.0 million,

-----

comprising land and buildings, plant and equipment, industrial and commercial equipment and other assets (ii)
amortization of intangible assets amounting to €5.0 million; and (iii) depreciation of leased assets of €4.6 million.
The €4.2 million decrease compared to the prior period, driven primarily by a lower value of intangible assets
amortization.

Amortization and depreciation, as a percentage of revenue, represented 15.3% and 15.2% for the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

_Bad debt provision_

Bad debt provision decreased by €0.4 million, or 41.0%, to €0.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 compared to €1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to increased
receivables recovery efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bad debt provision, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.3% and 0.5% for the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

_Other impairment losses_

Other impairment losses increased by €0.4 million to €0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
compared to €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, other
impairment losses comprised mainly of write-downs due to the withdrawal of two projects within the Group. For
the year ended December 31, 2020, other impairment losses mainly comprised write downs related to: (i) software;
(ii) product development and equipment costs for ultimately discontinued projects; and (iii) the site relocation and
other improvement costs related to our Japanese subsidiary.

Other impairment losses, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.3% and 0.1% for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

_Other operating costs_

Other operating costs decreased by €0.8 million, or 32.8%, to €1.7 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 compared to €2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by a decrease in other
miscellaneous operating fees and costs such as indemnities.

Other operating costs, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.9% and 1.1% for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

_Internal work capitalized_

Internal work capitalized increased by €2.8 million, or 17.6%, to €18.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 compared to €15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was due to
an increased investment in instrument sets to sustain our post-COVID-19 business recovery and to prepare for the
expected post-pandemic sales rebound.

Internal work capitalized, as a percentage of revenue, represented 9.5% and 7.0% for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

_Financial income_

Other financial income decreased by €2.0 million, or 39.8%, to €3.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2020, compared to €5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly due to lower value of unrealized
exchange gains.

Financial income, as a percentage of revenue, represented 1.6% and 2.3% for the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

_Financial expenses_

Financial expenses increased by €6.9 million, or 32.3%, to €28.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 compared to €21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was due to the combined
effect of lower financial charges, mainly related to the update of the valuation at fair value of outstanding
payments related to the TechMah transaction, and higher realized and unrealized exchange losses.

127


-----

Financial expenses, as a percentage of revenue, represented 14.6% and 9.6% for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

_Income tax benefit (expense)_

Income tax benefit decreased by €0.3 million, to €1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
compared to an income tax benefit of €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by a lower
amount of taxable income and higher amount of deferred taxes. The positive effect (benefit) in 2019 was due to
the combined effect of more current taxes (due to higher recorded sales) and accrued tax benefits from prior
periods. In 2020, the increase was due to higher current tax expense.

Income tax benefit, as a percentage of revenue, represented 0.9% and 0.9% for the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

_Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin_

Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €5.8 million, or 10.1%, to €51.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 from €57.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to decreased
sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused mobility restrictions and lockdowns and disruptions
of healthcare systems globally primarily resulting in the postponement of a large number of non-emergency and
elective procedures, as, among other factors, (i) hospital capacity and healthcare resources were significantly
rerouted to deal with patients suffering from COVID-19, (ii) many hospitals and healthcare providers placed
restrictions on the number and type of non-emergency and elective procedures performed at their facilities, and
(iii) many candidates for such procedures preferred to minimize their exposure to clinical settings for fear of
contracting COVID-19.

Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 0.8 percentage points, to 26.6% for the year ended December
31, 2020 from 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to swift action taken
by management in advancing savings initiatives for the period, such as price negotiation initiatives and channel
cost savings that we implemented by lowering travel and medical conference costs during the COVID-19
pandemic, all of which contributed to our profitability.

For more information, see “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—
_Other Financial Information and Operating Data.”_

**Liquidity**

To date, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from both operating activities and
financing activities. We held cash and cash equivalents of €19.5 million, €26.3 million and €21.5 million as of
December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, we held cash and cash equivalents
of €26.3 million, supported by our Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

Historically, our principal sources of liquidity on an ongoing basis have consisted in cash generated from
our operating activities and borrowings under credit lines, such as drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility. Following the Offering, our principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash generated from our
operating activities and available drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could_
_adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt, including the Notes.”_
For more information, please refer to our consolidated balance sheet and corresponding notes thereto in the
Consolidated Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Our primary uses of cash are linked to working capital requirements, Capital Expenditures, payment of
taxes and the making of interest payments on our indebtedness. Our business requires investment in working
capital, which is susceptible to fluctuations, particularly as a result of inventory purchase patterns. Inventory
purchase activity is a function of sales activity and our desired level of inventory. Historically, working capital
requirements have been higher in the first half of the year as we increase our inventory levels in order to be able
to timely meet customer demand in the second half of the year. Cash provided by operating activities is typically
higher in our second half of the year. From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions to expand our product
portfolio. To the extent we pursue these transactions, we could consume a significant portion of capital resources
or choose to seek additional debt financing.

128


-----

Our ability to generate sufficient cash for our ongoing operations depends on our operating performance,
which in turn depends, to some extent, on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors,
many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” In addition, we are,
and following the Refinancing will continue to be, highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness—Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations
_could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt, including the_
_Notes.”_

**Cash Flow**

As we transition to a post-pandemic business environment, our cash flows from operations have been
supported by increased sales and the maintenance of cost savings initiatives implemented during the pandemic,
and we recorded cash flows from operating activities of €34.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2022 as compared to €21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. We also generated recordlevel Cash Conversion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 47.1% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021, supported by an overall decrease in Net Working Capital for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022. We believe we are well-positioned to maintain such cash flows over the medium-term, as
continued investment into our business during the COVID-19 pandemic (reflected in our cash flows used in
investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020), leaves us well-positioned to take advantage of the
backlog of elective surgeries resulting from COVID-19-related delays, which we estimate at over €60.0 million
of sales for our business over the medium-term. Going forward, we believe we will also be able to further optimize
our cash flows used in our Capital Expenditures, as (i) we are subject to relatively limited Maintenance Capital
Expenditures (ii) we are able to adapt Growth Capital Expenditures, which are inherently discretionary (for
example, expenditures on new instrument sets and manufacturing facility expansions), to market conditions and
(iii) we are able to benefit from significant capital investments undertaken in prior periods.

In general, our cash flows were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as we recorded lower sales and
therefore lower cash flows from operating activities at the height of the crisis (primarily the year ended December
31, 2020). In order to protect our cash flows, we implemented a number of savings initiatives, such as price
negotiation initiatives with suppliers and channel cost savings that we accrued by lowering travel and medical
conference costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were also able to further bolster our financial flexibility
with a capital injection of €20.0 million in June 2020 from our shareholders, providing precautionary support
during the early months of the crisis.

The following table sets forth combined cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2020 and 2021 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022.

We generated €34.2 million of cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2022 compared to €21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase compared to the
prior period was primarily due to improved operating results, coupled with lower Net Working Capital absorption
as a result of ongoing normalization in our DSO and DIO, with the foregoing trending back towards their prepandemic 2019 levels, aided by increased sales in geographies with better payment terms, such as the United
States. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future, resulting in Net Working Capital as a percentage
of sales aligning to pre-pandemic levels and contributing to further improvements to our cash generation. See “—
_Net Working Capital.”_

-----

Cash flows used in investing activities amounted to €24.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2022 compared to €23.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in expenditures
was primarily due to the higher amount of capital expenditures during the period related to tangible assets,
specifically instrument sets, in line with increased sales for the period. However, cash flows used in investing
activities for the period decreased as a percentage of revenue as compared to the prior period, as we benefited
from significant investments undertaken in prior periods to sustain our post-COVID-19 business recovery and to
prepare for the expected post-pandemic sales rebound. We believe our historical Capital Expenditures have left
us well-invested, as continued investment into our business during the COVID-19 pandemic (reflected in our
Capital Expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020) positions us to take advantage of the backlog of
elective surgeries resulting from COVID-19-related delays, which we estimate at over €60.0 million of sales for
our business over the medium-term. Going forward, we believe we will also be able to further optimize our cash
flows used in our Capital Expenditures, as (i) we are subject to relatively limited Maintenance Capital
Expenditures and (ii) we are able to adapt Growth Capital Expenditures, which are inherently discretionary (for
example, expenditures on new instrument sets and manufacturing facility expansions), to market conditions. See
“—Capital Expenditure.”

Cash flows from (used in) financing activities amounted to a net outflow of €4.9 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2022 compared to a net outflow of €5.0 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2021. Both amounts primarily comprise cash outflows related to the payment of interest, mainly on the
Existing Notes and Existing Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by interest income collected during the
respective period.

**_Comparison of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020_**

We generated €48.4 million of cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021
compared to €22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase compared to the prior period was
primarily due to an increase in operating profit and lower Net Working Capital following management’s decision
to rebalance stocks and materials purchasing in line with delays in sales due to the lingering impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Cash flows used in investing activities amounted to €34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
compared to €46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in expenditures was primarily
due to the lower amount of capital expenditures during the period related to tangible assets, specifically machinery
and equipment, partially offset by higher spending related to other intangible assets, Smart SPACE and the
development of digital solutions such as digitally-assisted surgery platforms. See “—Capital Expenditure.”

Cash flows from (used in) financing activities amounted to a net outflow of €19.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021 compared to a net inflow of €30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Both
amounts primarily comprise cash outflows related to the payment of interest, mainly on the Existing Notes and
Existing Revolving Credit Facility, amounting to €12.4 million in both periods. The net outflow for the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to the net inflow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to
lower drawings of the Revolving Credit Facility, with such drawings amounting to €7.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to drawings of €18.0 million for the prior period, as well as a capital injection
of €20.0 million received in June 2020 from our shareholders as a precautionary measure to ensure financial
flexibility during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Comparison of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019_**

We generated €22.8 million of cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020
compared to €40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the lower
operating profit for the period together with the impact of the increase in Net Working Capital for the period. The
increase in Net Working Capital was driven mainly by higher inventories, following management’s decision to
maintain higher stock levels during the pandemic to be ready for the expected business rebound in 2021, and by
lower trade payables related to the slowdown of materials purchasing in the last two months of the 2021 year
linked to second wave of the pandemic.

Cash flows used in investing activities amounted to €46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
compared to €37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in expenditures was primarily due
to the higher amount of capital expenditures related to both tangible and intangible assets, following
management’s decision to keep investing in key medium-term development projects notwithstanding the
immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—Capital Expenditure.”

Cash flows from (used in) financing activities amounted to a net inflow of €30.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net outflow of €7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Both
amounts primarily comprise cash outflows related to the payment of interest, mainly on the Existing Notes and
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. The net inflow for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the
net outflow for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in drawings under the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility to a total amount of €18 million for the year as well as a capital contribution of €20
million received in June 2020 as a precautionary measure to ensure financial flexibility during the first months of
the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Net Working Capital**

We define “Net Working Capital” as the sum of trade receivables, inventories and other current assets
less the sum of trade payables and other current liabilities. The following table sets forth the calculation of Net
Working Capital for the periods indicated:

**As of December 31,** **As of September 30,**

**2019** **2020** **2021** **2021** **2022**

(in millions of €)

The following tables sets forth our DSO (days sales outstanding), DPO (days payables outstanding) and
DIO (days inventory outstanding) for the periods presented as we believe it provides additional detail on our
inventory and working capital management:

**For the year ended December 31,** **For the nine months ended September 30,**

**2019** **2020** **2021** **2021** **2022**

(number of days)

DSO (days)[(a)] .......................... 107 117 113 115 104

DPO (days)[(b)].......................... 82 84 93 74 86

DIO (days)[(c)]........................... 478 608 569 587 510

(1) We calculate DSO (days sales outstanding) as our trade receivables for the period divided by revenue for the period, further
multiplied by 360 (or 270 in the case of nine month periods) to approximate the number of days in a calendar year or period, as
applicable.

131


-----

(2) We calculate DPO (days payables outstanding) as our trade payables for the period divided by the sum of raw materials,
consumables, supplies and goods, services and other operating costs, further multiplied by 360 (or 270 in the case of nine month
periods) to approximate the number of days in a calendar year or period, as applicable.

(3) We calculate DIO (days inventory outstanding) as our inventories for the period divided by Cost of Goods Sold for the period,
further multiplied by 360 (or 270 in the case of nine month periods) to approximate the number of days in a calendar year or
period, as applicable.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant disruptions to ordinary course business practices across
commercial industries, including the medical device industry. Beyond decreased sales as a result of delayed
medical procedures, resulting in higher inventories across the industry, payment and delivery terms were extended
for market participants, their customers and their suppliers, resulting in working capital increases as inventories
remained on hand and as payables and receivables remained outstanding for relatively longer periods of time. In
connection with the post-pandemic rebound in commercial activity across our industry, we are experiencing an
encouraging normalization in our DSO and DIO, with the foregoing trending back towards their pre-pandemic
2019 levels, aided by increased sales in geographies with better payment terms, such as the United States. We
also expect to similarly move towards normalizing our days payables outstanding (“DPO”) to pre-COVID-19
levels over the medium term. We expect these existing and expected normalization trends to continue for the
foreseeable future, resulting in Net Working Capital as a percentage of sales aligning to pre-pandemic levels and
contributing to further improvements to our cash generation.

The decrease in Net Working Capital as of September 30, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 was
driven by an increase in trade receivables for the period, in line with higher sales, partially offset by an increase
in trade payables, and an increase in other current liabilities (primarily a result of the unwinding of a long-term
incentive share plan arrangement with our outgoing chief executive officer). The increase in inventories for the
period was in support of the post-pandemic sales rebound, with days sales outstanding (“DSO”) and days
inventory outstanding (“DIO”) normalizing to pre-COVID-19 levels. Our Net Working Capital as of September
30, 2022 is in line with the seasonal cycle, decreasing in the second half of the year as we build-up in the first half
of the year to ensure product availability in the later months.

The increase in Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was
driven by an increase in trade receivables as a result of higher sales, and increased inventories to support the thenexpected post-pandemic sales rebound.

The increase in Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was
primarily attributable to an increase in inventories due to reduced sales during the COVID-19 pandemic (and the
corresponding decision to maintain inventories), in each case in support of the then-expected post-pandemic sales
rebound.

**Capital Expenditure**

We define Capital Expenditures as the increases in property, plant and equipment and other intangible
assets. Historically, Capital Expenditures has comprised the additions to intangible assets (including start-up and
expansion costs, R&D, development and patents and intellectual property rights) and the additions to tangible
assets (land and buildings, plant and machinery and industrial and commercial equipment, including instrument
sets). For our own internal purposes, we additionally segment our Capital Expenditures into: (i) Growth Capital
Expenditures (i.e., discretionary expenditures), which we define as increases in property, plant and equipment and
other intangible assets which, in each case, are utilized to expand our business or to increase the long-term
operating capacity of our assets or our operating income, for example, through the distribution of instrument sets
to new customers or expenditures related to increasing our production capacity (including the addition of new
manufacturing machinery such as 3D printers); and (ii) Maintenance Capital Expenditures, which we define as
increases in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets which, in each case, are utilized to maintain
the efficiency or increase the longevity of our capital assets, for example through the replacement of instruments
within existing instrument sets or expenditures related to maintenance and repair of our capital assets.

We believe that, in spite of the general economic fears and risks due to the COVID-19 outbreak, our
sustained Capital Expenditures in 2020 highlighted our intentions to pursue our long-term development objectives
through continuous investments in key growth drivers such as R&D and innovation, process and products
digitalization, staff training and customer conversion. We believe our historical Capital Expenditures have left us
well-invested, as continued investment into our business during the COVID-19 pandemic (reflected in our Capital
Expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020) positions us to take advantage of the backlog of elective
surgeries resulting from COVID-19-related delays, which we estimate at over €60.0 million of sales for our
business over the medium-term. Going forward, we believe we will also be able to further optimize our cash flows

-----

used in our Capital Expenditures, as (i) we are subject to relatively limited Maintenance Capital Expenditures and
(ii) we are able to adapt Growth Capital Expenditures, which are inherently discretionary (for example,
expenditures on new instrument sets and manufacturing facility expansions), to market conditions.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we classified approximately 33% of our Capital
Expenditures as Maintenance Capital Expenditures and approximately 67% as Growth Capital Expenditures (as
compared to 31% and 69%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021). For the year ended
December 31, 2021, we classified approximately 20% of our Capital Expenditures as Maintenance Capital
Expenditures and 80% as Growth Capital Expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we classified
approximately 20% of our Capital Expenditures as Maintenance Capital Expenditures and approximately 80% as
Growth Capital Expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we classified approximately 24% of our
Capital Expenditures as Maintenance Capital Expenditures and approximately 76% as Growth Capital
Expenditures.

We have historically financed our Capital Expenditures through cash generated through our operations,
cash on hand and financing from financial institutions, and expect to continue to finance our Capital Expenditures
in a similar manner in 2022. In the medium term, we expect to benefit from our previous investments in our
platform and to gradually reduce our Growth Capital Expenditure as a result of the long life of the instruments
sets deployed and the expected increase in turn per sets. As such, we expect our yearly Maintenance Capital
Expenditures over the medium-term to amount to approximately €5-8 million, in line with historical levels, and
our yearly Growth Capital Expenditures to remain in the range of 5-10% of sales (with Growth Capital
Expenditures trending towards the lower end of this range assuming the completion of our discretionary expansion
of production capacity at our Villanova di San Daniele site in 2024, including a distribution center and additional
manufacturing plant capacity).

The following table sets forth (i) the calculation of Capital Expenditures for the periods indicated,
attributing increases in other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to (a) Smart SPACE and other
expenditures related to the development of digital solutions such as digitally-assisted surgery platforms, (b) other
intangibles, (c) instrument sets and (d) other property, plant and equipment and (ii) amounts attributable to Growth
Capital Expenditures and Maintenance Capital Expenditures:

**_Smart SPACE / Enabling tech investment_**

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we invested in Smart SPACE, and made other
expenditures related to the development of digital solutions such as digitally-assisted surgery platforms, for an
amount of €4.4 million as compared to €5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease
as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily attributable to a reduction in the number
of employees driven by the integration of processes and organization within the Group structure.

133


-----

For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we invested in Smart SPACE, and made other
expenditures related to the development of digital solutions such as digitally-assisted surgery platforms, for an
amount of €7.6 million, €7.5 million and €4.1 million, respectively, comprising capitalized costs sustained for the
development of Smart SPACE through TechMah. As of the date of this offering memorandum, TechMah’s initial
integration phase (which required the significant expenditures we recorded in 2021, 2020 and 2019) has drawn to
a close and, additionally, we expect to further integrate TechMah’s business operations into our headquarters in
2023. As a result, we expect such costs will decrease materially and expect to record significantly reduced
expenditures related to the development of Smart SPACE going forward.

**_Other intangibles_**

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we invested in other intangibles for an amount of €3.6
million as compared to €3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, comprising start-up and
expansion costs, R&D, development and costs related to patents and intellectual property rights not otherwise
attributable to Smart SPACE and the development of digital solutions such as digitally-assisted surgery platforms.

For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we invested in other intangibles for an amount
of €6.5 million, €6.7 million and €6.5 million, respectively, primarily related (i) to costs incurred to purchase
software licenses and patents and (ii) to costs for the development of products and for the registration of products
or trademarks in certain markets.

**_Instrument sets_**

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we invested in instrument sets for an amount of €10.6
million as compared to €11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, following the decision to
focus deployment of Instrument Sets only in strategic markets along with significant investments undertaken
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we invested in instrument sets for an amount of €15.1 million,
with a decrease of €2.3 million compared to €17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due
to the slower deployment of new instrument sets and instrument components due to lower sales during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we invested in instrument sets for an amount of €17.4 million,
compared to €14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the increased deployment of
new instrument sets and instrument components to develop new business, enhance our relationships in sales
regions and to be ready to capitalize on the then-expected sales rebound after an easing of the COVID-19
pandemic.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we invested in instrument sets in the amount of €14.9 million,
primarily related to the purchase of new instrument sets and instrument components.

**_Other property, plant and equipment_**

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we invested in other property, plant and equipment for
an amount of €6.8 million as compared to €4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, comprising
amounts attributable to increases in land and buildings, plant and machinery and industrial and commercial
equipment, excluding instrument sets. The increase as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021
was primarily attributable to maintenance investments at our Villanova di San Daniele production facility.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we invested in other property, plant and equipment for an amount
of €7.8 million, comprising amounts attributable to increases in land and buildings, plant and machinery and
industrial and commercial equipment, excluding instrument sets. Such amounts primarily related to (i) the
completion of our headquarters expansion which began in 2019; (ii) to the purchase during the year of plant and
machinery for use in production; and (iii) light manufacturing equipment, assets under construction and payments
on account related to the purchase of machinery for production.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we invested in other property, plant and equipment for an amount
of €15.4 million, comprising amounts attributable to increases in land and buildings, plant and machinery and
industrial and commercial equipment, excluding instrument sets. Such amounts primarily related to (i) the
construction at our headquarters of a new grey room dedicated to the production of cleanliness requirements
products. Such amount also includes the reclassification of the works for the new additive manufacturing 3D

134


-----

printing facility leased within the HSS campus in New York; (ii) the new production grey room plant in Villanova
di San Daniele and the set-up of the new additive manufacturing 3D printing facility within the HSS campus in
New York; and (iii) light manufacturing equipment, assets under construction and payments on account related
to the purchase of machinery for production.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we invested in other property, plant and equipment for an amount
of €13.0 million, comprising amounts attributable to increases in land and buildings, plant and machinery and
industrial and commercial equipment, excluding instrument sets. Such amounts primarily related to (i) the
construction of a new Innovation Center in Villanova di San Daniele and to the expansion of its laboratory area;
(ii) the purchase during the year of plant and machinery for use in production, especially with reference to the
new production plant in Villanova di San Daniele opened in 2018; and (iii) assets under construction and payments
on account, referring almost exclusively to the purchase of machinery for production.

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

**_Guarantee_**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we do not maintain any material off-balance sheet guarantee
arrangements other than our guarantees of the Existing Notes and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Factoring_**

The Issuer is party to certain non-recourse agreements with factoring counterparties pursuant to which
we make sales of trade receivables to such counterparties. As of December 31, 2021, the receivables sold under
our non-recourse factoring arrangements equaled €0.9 million. This amount is not treated as financial debt in our
consolidated balance sheet.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

**_Credit risk management_**

This is the risk that a customer or the counterparty to a financial instrument will be unable to meet an
obligation, leading to a financial loss. These risks arise mainly in relation to trade receivables. As of December
31, 2021, most of our receivables are due from public entities. In particular, we have credit exposure to national
healthcare systems of Italy, Spain, Portugal and Eastern European countries, where the average collection periods
longer compared to, for example, other European countries, and we have not experienced significant losses. We
do not believe that there were any significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2021. The timing
of payments is closely monitored to verify compliance with agreed contractual terms.

As of December 31, 2021, we did not have exposures with individual customers for more than 10% of
our total trade receivables and our top ten customers accounted for 6% of total trade receivables.

Credit risk is being mitigated by increasing the volume of sales in countries where average collection
times are shorter, thus reducing the weighting of markets in which the credit risk is higher. The value of
receivables considered doubtful is not significant compared to the total value of the receivables and is covered by
appropriate provisions. As of December 31, 2021, we recorded loss allowances of €2.1 million.

**_Liquidity risk management_**

This risk relates to our ability to meet obligations arising from financial liabilities. In addition to having
implemented effective working capital and cash management, we have implemented short-term and medium-term
liquidity forecasts. We have access to credit lines granted by financial institutions (for example, our Existing
Revolving Credit Facility) to cover any unforeseen needs until medium/long-term sources can be secured.
Liquidity risk is mitigated through monitoring of available liquid assets (in the short and medium term),
monitoring of future liquidity conditions in relation to corporate planning and careful management of credit
facilities. Historically, we have met our financial obligations on time.

**_Currency risk management_**

While we report financial information using the euro, our international operations may expose us to
currency exchange rate risks in the ordinary course of our business, particularly regarding the U.S. dollar, the
pound sterling, the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar. We assess our foreign currency exposure by

135


-----

considering balance sheet items, uncompleted contracts denominated in foreign currencies as well as planned
collections and purchases denominated in foreign currencies. We have adopted a series of policies and processes
aimed at minimizing the effects of currency exchange by monitoring fluctuations of the main currencies in which
we operate relative to the euro, although we did not enter into any specific hedging arrangement. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to our Industry and Business—We are exposed to currency exchange and translation_
_risks, which may reduce our operating results.”_

The following tables show the approximate change in our profit or loss in response to a 5% depreciation
or appreciation, respectively, of the U.S. dollar, the pound sterling, the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar
against the euro as of the respective balance sheet date. This analysis assumed that all other variables, in particular
interest rates, remain constant.

**_Interest rate risk management_**

Interest rate risk refers to the risk that market interest rates will increase, resulting in higher borrowing
costs under our credit facilities, such as the Existing Notes and borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility. We constantly monitor interest rate risk in order to minimize its economic impact in case of material
increases.

We may be affected by changes in market interest rates at the time we need to refinance any of our
indebtedness. We may be affected by mark-to-market losses in the fair value of our outstanding financial debt or
interest rate derivatives to the extent that there is a mismatch between them or hedge accounting cannot be applied.
We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Financial instruments are measured and recognized
at fair value. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Certain of our indebtedness
_bears interest at a variable rate, which could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow,_
_or could otherwise be adverse to the interests of holders of the Notes.”_

**Consolidation Principles**

The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared using the financial statements of the Issuer and
the entities in which the Issuer, directly or indirectly, holds the controlling interest or exercises control. The
financial statements of the entities included within the scope of consolidation have been consolidated on a
line-by-line basis. Entities are not consolidated if it is not possible to exercise control over their activities, for
legal or other reasons. Long-term investments in unconsolidated entities are measured at cost if the equity interest
held is less than 20%; if greater than 20%, they are measured at equity. For consolidation purposes, the separate
financial statements of each entity have been reclassified and adjusted for consistency with the accounting policies
and presentation criteria adopted by the Group.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

**_Summary of significant account policies and estimates_**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that management apply accounting
standards and methods which, under certain circumstances, are based on difficult subjective measurements and
estimates based on past experience and on assumptions considered, at various times, to be reasonable and realistic

136


-----

in terms of the respective circumstances. The use of such estimates and assumptions affects the amounts reported
in the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the information disclosed.

Actual results for those areas requiring management judgment or estimates may differ from those
recorded in the financial statements due to the occurrence of events and the uncertainties which characterize the
assumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based.

The primary areas applicable to our Group that involve greater subjectivity in making estimates and
where a change in the conditions underlying the assumptions could have a significant impact on our Consolidated
Financial Statements include the items discussed below. For further information, please see the notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements provided elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets_

Property, plant and equipment (tangible assets) and intangible assets are shown at original historical cost
less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses (if applicable). The cost of tangible assets
and intangible assets is depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
The economic useful life of the asset is determined at the time of purchase, based on historical experience for
similar assets, market conditions and expected future events which may affect them, such as technological
changes. The effective economic useful life may therefore be different from the estimated useful life.

_Provisions for risks and charges_

Provisions for risks and charges are provided in respect of known or probable losses or liabilities whose
timing and extent cannot be reliably determined at the year-end but an estimation of cost can be provided by
management. Provisions for risks and charges are recognized when we have a present obligation (legal or
constructive) as a result of a past event, and consequently, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of
the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
present obligation or transfer it to third parties at the reporting date. Where the effect of the discounting is material,
the provisions are calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate that reflects the time value
of money. If such discounting is performed, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized
as a financial expense.

_Provision for write-downs of receivables_

Receivables are recognized at the nominal amount, less provisions applied based on management’s
estimation of the recoverability of the receivable. A provision for impairment of receivables is recorded when
there are indications that the full carrying value of the receivable may not be recoverable. The provision covers
the estimate of the risk of losses which derives from past experience with similar receivables, from the analysis
of overdue receivables (current and historical), of losses and recoveries and finally from monitoring economic
trends and forecasts both currently and prospectively to our business.

_Impairment Test_

Pursuant to IAS 36, goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment at least annually
or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. With regard to testing goodwill
for impairment, we identified a single operating CGU for our operations. We considered the sources of
information set out by IAS 36 such as the fact that our management monitors the group’s performance and takes
strategic decisions about its product offering and investments at group level.

_Inventories_

Raw materials and packaging are measured at the lower of purchase cost and estimated replacement
value based on market trends. The cost is calculated using the weighted average cost for the year. Semi-finished
products and finished goods are measured at purchase or production cost, considering their stage of completion,
or their realizable value based on market trends, if lower. The production cost includes the reasonably attributable
portion of direct and indirect manufacturing costs.

The resulting amount is written down through the allowance for inventory write-down to account for
items whose expected realizable value is lower than their cost.

137


-----

_Revenue recognition_

Based on the five-step model introduced by IFRS 15, we recognize revenue after identifying the
contract(s) with a customer and the performance obligations in the contract (transfer of goods and/or services),
determining the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for fulfilling performance
obligations (at a point in time or over time). Revenue is measured on the basis of the transaction price excluding
amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Based on our internal analysis of contracts with customers, we have
not identified any performance obligations that are satisfied over time and, therefore, we recognize revenue upon
the transfer of control of the promised goods or services to the customer. Revenue is measured to the extent that
it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to our group and the amount can be measured reliably.

Revenue is adjusted for any discounts and volume rebates allowed by us in contracts with customers.

Expense is recognized when the goods and services are sold or consumed during the year or by systematic
allocation, or when it is not possible to identify their future use.

Expense items are classified by nature in accordance with the applicable IFRS.

**Global industry overview**

We operate in the large and attractive global orthopedic implants market, valued at approximately
$45.5 billion in 2019, as estimated by a global management consulting company. The global orthopedic implants
market is composed of the following segments: (i) joint reconstruction devices for full or partial replacement of
the hip, knee and extremities (shoulder, elbow, hand/wrist, foot/ankle), (ii) spine devices, (iii) trauma devices,
(iv) dental implants, (v) sports medicine devices, and (vi) craniomaxillofacial implants. The market has
demonstrated historical stable growth and resilience, and growth in the coming years is expected to have continued
support by a number of favorable underlying secular trends such as ageing population, increase in related diseases,
more active lifestyle for younger population, technological innovation, and the shift to the outpatient setting.

We are primarily active in three joint replacement segments: extremities (shoulder and elbow), knee and
hip. The market is further broken down into primary procedures (first joint replacement) and revision procedures
(replacement of a previously implanted device due to natural progression of the implant, trauma, or other causes).
We also offer custom solutions for these segments, a highly specialized product category for patients with complex
cases for whom off-the-shelf implants may not fit. Our key markets, the U.S., Italy, Germany, the UK, Australia,
Japan and France, which together accounted for approximately 63% of our revenue as of nine months ended
September 30, 2022, represented a total addressable market for shoulder, knee and hip of approximately $13.5
billion in 2019, as shown in the chart below, according to the analysis of a global management consulting
company.

-----

###### Shoulder, Knee and Hip Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2007-2025 ($Bn)

_Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._

Our addressable market is large, resilient and has experienced stable growth over the last 15 years, and
through times of economic crises, with a CAGR of 2.5-3.0% from 2007 to 2019. The growth trajectory in our key
markets is expected to continue with a projected CAGR of approximately 1.0-1.5% from 2019 to 2025. Hip and
knee are the largest and more mature segments of the market, with a CAGR of 1.0-1.5% and 2.0-2.5%,
respectively, from 2017 to 2019. The hip segment is projected to grow at a CAGR of 0.1-0.5% from 2019 to 2025,
while the knee segment is projected to grow at a CAGR of 0.5-1.0% over the same period. The shoulder segment,
which is our key strategic focus area, is smaller (approximately 12% of total addressable market), yet fast-growing
due to the currently lower penetration of shoulder implants and a higher rate of technological innovation compared
to the hip and knee segments. Between 2017 and 2019, the shoulder segment recorded a CAGR of 9.0-9.5% and
is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.0-5.5% from 2019 to 2025.

In terms of geographical relevance, the U.S. represents the largest market globally for shoulder, knee and
hip implants ($9.7 billion market value in 2019), driven primarily by the rise in elderly population, increased
number of surgeries for younger patients and increases in safety and reliability of implant procedures coupled
with favorable reimbursement policies. In Europe, Germany is the largest market (approximately $810 million in
2019), followed by the UK (approximately $615 million in 2019), France (approximately $550 million in 2019),
and Italy (approximately $450 million in 2019). In Asia-Pacific, Japan (approximately $930 million in 2019) and
Australia (approximately $475 million in 2019) represent the most sizeable market opportunities and have both
experienced a relatively light impact from COVID-19 pandemic.

_Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._

Based on our product mix and large exposure to the faster-growing shoulder segment, the implied
expected weighted market growth (calculated as market revenue growth weighted to reflect the proportion of our
revenues derived from shoulder, hip and knee segments) is higher than the baseline implants market growth
(expected weighted market CAGR of 3.0-3.5% from 2019 to 2025, compared to expected baseline implants
market CAGR of 1.0-1.5% from 2019 to 2025, as shown in the graphic “Shoulder, Knee and Hip Implant Market
_in our Key Markets, 2007-2025” above). A further increase in weighted growth in revenue of 6.0-6.5% is expected_
over the period from 2021 to 2025 (compared to expected baseline implants market CAGR of 4.0-4.5% from 2021
to 2025, as shown in the graphic “Shoulder, Knee and Hip Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2007-2025”
above), in part due to the accumulated procedure backlog as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, with return to the
long-term growth trajectory after the acute stage of the COVID-19 pandemic (according to a global management
consulting company).

**Market trends**

Long-term growth in the orthopedic implants market is supported by a number of favorable secular
trends, including:

    - _Ageing population: growing elderly population increases the number of people needing joint_
replacements;

    - _Increase in related diseases: growth in procedure volumes due to increasing prevalence of_
orthopedic disorders related to age (such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis) and unhealthy lifestyle;

    - _Increasing demand from younger population: increasing number of procedures in younger patients_
due to more active lifestyles and improved lifespan of today’s implants;

    - _Innovation: technological advances in 3D printing (also known as additive manufacturing), new_
materials, implant design, robot-assisted surgical procedures, intra-OP guidance and digital
solutions; and

    - _Shift to outpatient setting: shift of procedures out of the hospital and into ambulatory surgery centers_
(“ASCs”) in some countries (especially the U.S.) due to lower cost burden and reduced infection
rates as patients are discharged within 23 hours of care (source: Edmonston D.L., Foulkes G.D.
_Infection rate and risk factor analysis in an orthopaedic ambulatory surgical center. J Surg Orthop_
_Adv. 2010 Fall;19:174–176)._

141


-----

In recent years, growth in procedure volumes has been partially offset by pressure on average selling
prices (“ASP”) of orthopedic implants, driven by factors such as government cuts to healthcare spending, private
payer reimbursement pressures and broader focus on cost containment. This trend has been particularly noticeable
in the hip and knee segment of the market due to a higher degree of commoditization and larger volume of
procedures. Pricing pressures have been less severe in our key segments: extremities, revision surgeries and
custom implants. Therefore, we have been able to sustain high gross margin due to our exposure to high value
segments and markets and, according to our strategy and our geographical and diverse product mix, we plan to
continue increasing our exposure to these high value segments and markets.

**Impact of COVID-19 pandemic**

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 resulted in a 15-20% revenue decline in our key markets driven by
postponed elective surgeries during the acute phase of the pandemic due to lockdowns. However, we have already
seen a quick rebound and we expect a further acceleration to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels of 2019 with further
accelerated growth over the period from 2021 to 2023. The rebound is driven by the absorption of accumulated
direct backlog from lockdown periods in 2020 and 2021, as well as a ripple effect of patients whose procedures
were or are delayed due to the extended waiting lists during recovery. Orthopaedic conditions can be painful or
limit the mobility of a person, but they are not usually life-threatening, and surgeries can be safely postponed (in
favor of more urgent procedures); however, since patients still need to undertake the surgeries, these procedures
are generally just delayed. We expect that COVID-19 pandemic will not have an overall structural impact on the
orthopedic implants market, and the fulfilment of the backlog of postponed orthopedic procedures is expected to
boost growth over the coming years. According to data analyzed by a global management consulting company,
the market is expected to return to its long-term growth trajectory after 2024 when the COVID-19 pandemic
related backlog is expected to be completely absorbed.

###### COVID-19 Pandemic Resulting in Postponed Surgeries and Followed by Backlog-Driven Catch-up in our Key Markets

_Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._

The orthopedic market developments are different across geographical markets. In particular, Italy, the
UK and France experienced stronger COVID-19 pandemic impact due to stricter and more prolonged lockdowns
and COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions throughout 2020 and part of 2021, while the COVID-19 pandemic
impact in the U.S., Germany, Japan and Australia was more moderate with respect to sales volumes of orthopedic
implants. For example, the U.S. saw a moderate decline in revenue of 15-20% during 2020 due to COVID-19
pandemic. We also believe and expect that elective surgeries that were deferred for reasons related to COVID-19
pandemic have resumed starting from the fourth quarter of 2021 as the healthcare system returns to full capacity
in the U.S. In contrast, Italy and the UK saw a more severe COVID-19 pandemic impact with overall sales in
2020 down 35-40% and 46-47%, respectively. According to a global management consulting company, the
recovery of the backlog in Italy and the UK is expected to have a positive impact from 2021 until beyond 2025,
as patients surgeries postponed during COVID-19 pandemic lead to additional ripple effect in later years.

In March 2021, the Italian Arthroplasty Registry (or “RIAP”), which is specialized organization within
the Italian National Public Advisory Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità), who keeps a registry of joint
replacement surgeries in Italy, published a report examining the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on elective
surgeries in seven Italian regions through September 30, 2020 (source: Registro Italiano ArtroProtesi, Rapporto
_ISS COVID-19 n. 7/2021 Rev – Impatto dell’emergenza COVID-19 sui volumi di attività della chirurgia protesica_
_ortopedica in sette Regioni italiane, March 31, 2021). The study considered a statistically significant sample,_
representing approximately 40% of the total number of elective procedures performed in Italy. As shown in the
chart below, the number of elective procedures performed in 2020 were significantly lower compared to the
months of March, April, May, and June of 2019. As surgeries have been postponed but not cancelled, there has
been a significant build-up of backlog which is expected to clear over time as COVID-19 pandemic cases reduce
and capacity for elective procedures is restored. The number of procedures performed in August and September
of 2020 have demonstrated the potential of such trend. As the number of COVID-19 pandemic cases reduced in
2020, the number of surgeries increased to levels well above 2018 and 2019 before being impacted by a new wave
of COVID-19 pandemic cases. RIAP estimates that during 2020 approximately 135,000 elective orthopedic
procedures were postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. In 2019, the number of orthopedic implant
surgeries neared 220,000.

**Segment Overview**

_Shoulder_

The shoulder segment is smaller compared to the large joints segment but growing faster, driven by
continued technological innovation and surgeon adoption. The shoulder market is expected to outgrow in terms
of percent growth the more mature hip and knee implant markets due to currently lower penetration of shoulder
implants. According to a global management consulting company, the shoulder market for our key geographies
was valued at $1.6 billion in 2019. As the shoulder segment is not as developed and penetrated as the hip and
knee markets, volume growth is significantly higher. The market grew at a CAGR of 9.0-9.5% from 2017 to 2019
and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.0-5.5% from 2019 to 2025. The reverse shoulder sub-segment has the
strongest growth (approximately 3 percentage points above the general shoulder market), driven by advancing
technologies and improved patient outcomes, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.0-8.5% from 2019 to 2025.

###### Shoulder Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2017-2025 ($Bn)

_Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._

The shoulder market suffered a less severe impact from COVID-19 pandemic due to its stronger
underlying growth profile. Revenue declined by approximately 16-17% in 2020, however it is expected to return
to pre-COVID-19 pandemic level starting from 2021 (according to data elaborated by a global management
consulting company).

Our plan is to retain our leading position and to strengthen our position in the fast-growing and attractive
shoulder market in our key geographical areas. We believe that the future growth of our shoulder product
sub-segment will be characterized by innovation, including the use of innovative technologies such as TT
technology, and portfolio completion through ongoing product development. In particular, we have recently
successfully launched new products such as (i) the SMR Hybrid Glenoid, (ii) the SMR Lateralized Connectors,
(iii) the SMR Short Stem and (iv) the SMR TT Augmented 360 Glenoid. We have a strong focus and heritage in
the shoulder segment and will continue to develop our leading platform with strong exposure to attractive reverse
shoulder segment, focus on more complex cases with revision and custom-made implants. We have several
products in development, including the Prima Short Stem (which is currently in the Controlled Release phase),
the Prima TT glenoid and our Smart SPACE digital solutions for shoulder. Within these digital solutions, we plan
to launch the Lima Patient Specific Instruments (the “LPSI”) during the course of 2023, as an improved solution
that allows surgeons to autosegment CT scans, plan cases and design 3D positioners. We also plan to strengthen
our position in the elbow segment with our modular TEMA (Total Elbow Modular Arthroplasty) Elbow system,
the new system for Elbow joint replacement surgery characterized by modularity, convertibility and an innovative
design, which is approved in the U.S. and Europe.

_Large Joints (Hip and Knee)_

The knee implant market represents the largest segment within joint replacement (valued at $6.3 billion
in 2019 in our key geographies), followed by the hip implant market (valued at $5.6 billion in 2019 in our key
geographies). The mature knee and hip segments are projected to grow from 2019 to 2025 at a CAGR of 0.5-1.0%
and 0.1-0.5% respectively. Within this market, our key focus is the revision implant segment, which is growing
faster than the primary implant market and not commoditized, attracting higher margins, being more complex
procedures. As a result, while pricing pressure is expected to remain over the coming years, these pricing pressures
have been less severe in revision surgeries.

###### Knee Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2017-2025 ($Bn)


###### Hip Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2017-2025 ($Bn)


_Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._

The large joints market was more impacted by COVID-19 pandemic compared to the shoulder segment
due to its slower underlying growth profile. Market revenues for hip fell approximately 19-20% in 2020, while
knee revenues experienced a 21-22% decline. Return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels is expected for 2022,
initially boosted by the absorption of backlog for procedures that were postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to data elaborated by a global management consulting company, a normalization in market volumes
for hip and knee is forecasted between 2022 and 2023 due to the reduction in backlog, followed by a return to the
long-term trajectory starting in 2025.

Our plan is to strengthen our position in the large joints segment and particularly in the knee segment
and to further penetrate our key geographical areas by expanding our existing product offering in the hip and knee
segments, supported by a track record of clinical outcomes. We plan to further develop our comprehensive and
high-quality suite of implants for complex revision cases, which commands premium pricing due to higher
complexity of the surgical procedure. Recent product launches in the knee segment include: (i) the 3D printed
Anatomic Metaphyseal Fixation (“AMF”) TT Cones for complex primary and revision knee surgery and (ii) the
new Physica VitE and LMC liners. A number of our new products leverage our proprietary Trabecular Titanium
and 3D printing which will also allow us to command premium prices and continue to strengthen our position in
our key markets.

**Shift to Ambulatory Surgery Centers**

The market for less complex, routine orthopedic procedures has been experiencing a shift to outpatient
settings and ASCs, especially in the U.S. ASCs are healthcare facilities that offer patients the convenience of
having surgeries and procedures performed safely outside the hospital setting. Since their inception more than
four decades ago, ASCs have demonstrated an ability to improve quality and customer service while
simultaneously reducing costs (according to the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association). The trend has been
further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic as patients were less willing to undergo long hospital stays and
surgeons sought alternatives to increase procedure volume.

As shown in the chart above, the share of primary hip and knee arthroplasties in the U.S. performed in
ASCs is expected to reach approximately 20-30% by 2025 (a significant increase from 5-10% in 2018). The shift
to outpatient settings for shoulder procedures is also expected in the coming years, as preliminary clinical studies
show that these can be performed safely in ASCs.

We believe that the ASC segment represents an important opportunity for us given its underlying growth
and that we are well positioned to benefit from the strong growth expected in the outpatient/ASC market by
offering solutions addressing the need of efficiency which characterizes these centers. We have started a project
for the streamlining of instrument trays to address the ASC needs. We have also started a project which aims at
creating fully disposable instrument kits combined with personalized instrumentation for each patient which we
believe will increase the efficiency at the ASCs. In addition, we are setting-up an advisory board composed by
surgeons and other ASC stakeholders to understand specific ASC unmet needs and discuss future trends, with the
aim of defining the best ASC strategy, including the development of targeted products and services, including
economically structured contracts targeted to the ASCs.

**Custom-made implants market**

In addition to the traditional implant market, we are active in the custom-made implants market through
our ProMade offering, which sets us apart from competitors due to our 3D printing capabilities. Custom-made
implants represent approximately 1-2% of orthopedic segments revenue in our key markets. Custom-made
implants fulfill the needs of patients requiring complex joint reconstructions, for example, due to failed revisions,
bone cancer or deformities. High production effort of custom-made implants leads to higher prices compared to
standard implants. The total market for custom-made implants in our key regions was valued at $220-250 million
in 2019. We are active in the custom 3D-printed hip and extremities market, which was valued at $80-90 million
in 2019. The market declined by approximately 10-15% in 2020, primarily as a result of postponed elective
surgeries due to COVID-19 pandemic. However, a strong recovery and growth of approximately 8-12% CAGR
is expected between 2019-2025, driven by higher number of revisions and more advanced technologies which
allow the treatment of very complex revision cases, bone cancer cases and large deformities and trauma cases
which previously would have remained untreated (according to a global management consulting company).

###### 3D-Printed Hip & Extremities Custom-Made Implants Market in Key Regions[(1)], 2019-2025 ($MM)

_Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021). Note (1)_ _scope: the U.S., Italy, Germany, UK, Japan,_
Australia, Switzerland, France, Austria, China, Russia, Poland, South Korea, New Zealand.

The competitive landscape for custom-made solutions is fragmented. Large players like Stryker and
Zimmer Biomet are active in the market and hold a market share of 10-15% and 8-12% in 2019, respectively (as
estimated by a global management consulting company). However, smaller players are gaining share since they
are better able to cater to customized patient needs with relatively smaller volumes. We believe we are a leading
innovator with 3-4% market share in 2019 thanks to our 3D printing capabilities. We were the first player to open
a 3D design and 3D printing center for custom-made complex solutions at the point of care in a hospital setting
in partnership with the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York (one of the leading orthopedic hospitals
in the U.S., ranked by U.S. News as the leader in U.S. for orthopedics for 12 years in a row and top-ranked in
orthopedics and rheumatology for 31 consecutive years). The ProMade PoC Center, which was inaugurated and
became operational in March 2021, is operated by us on the HSS main campus in New York City and leverages
the combination of our advanced technology and experience, and HSS’ expertise in clinical care and
biomechanical engineering. The partnership increases the availability and speed of personalized orthopedic care
for patients with complex reconstruction cases in the U.S., reducing the time required during the design and
production phase.

**Digitally-assisted surgery market**

Orthopedics is undergoing a digital transformation with a strong shift towards technology-enabled
surgery solutions, opening up a new market opportunity. Digital solutions are the new frontier of orthopedic
surgery, with the arrival of surgical guidance systems and robots, which are used in combination with implants
and expected to assist surgeons during surgery and are often used as tools to market implants for companies. In
certain countries, surgeons also use digital technologies to market their practice.

The digitally-assisted surgery market is driven by three disruptive technologies facilitating surgical
procedures:

(1) _Robotics: Clinical robotic surgical system with camera and mechanical arms controlled by the_
surgeon via computer console, as well as smaller handheld robotic devices.

(2) _3D virtual planning and PSI: Creating virtual 3D models from CT and/or X-ray scans to enable_
a pre-operative surgical plan, selection of the optimal implant, and automated ordering of custom-made
patient-specific instruments (PSI).

147


-----

(3) _Guidance: Surgical technology enabling real-time feedback on the positioning of instruments,_
including virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).

Digital technologies are generating large amounts of data that can be used for various purposes, including
better anatomical reconstruction models, enhanced implant design, outcome predictability models, and
rehabilitation protocols refinement based on a personalized approach for each patient.

Disruptive technologies in the orthopedics market have shown strong growth in recent years. The main
focus of digitally-assisted offerings has historically been the knee segment, however they are expected to expand
towards hip and shoulder in the coming years. As shown in the chart below, the number of robotic procedures in
the U.S. has grown approximately 53% p.a. between 2017 and 2020 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of about
15% between 2020 and 2025.

_procedures assisted by 3D planning and guidance systems (on top of underlying market growth per segment) as estimated by a global_
_management consulting company._

Early adopters of digital technologies have observed rapid customer adoption of their solutions. Existing
systems for 3D planning or guidance in the shoulder segment have achieved 30-40% penetration in a few years
since their launch.

We believe that we are well-positioned to drive digital transformation in orthopedics through our Smart
SPACE digital solutions. Our digital shoulder solutions are already cleared by the FDA and in 2023 we will launch
LPSI, an improved solution that allows surgeons to autosegment CT scans, plan cases and design 3D positioners.

Guidance and robotics systems are seen as complementary offerings, especially in the hip and knee
segments where surgical robots are more advanced. Guidance systems are believed to be especially attractive for
value-driven smaller hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers with limited space available. Robotic systems with
high capital expenditure and space requirements are seen as more suitable for larger and high-volume hospitals.
However, for large hospitals, guidance solutions also offer a convenient alternative to robots, especially for
surgeons that are currently not using existing robots.

**Competitive landscape**

Following a period of industry consolidation, four large multinational companies (Zimmer Biomet,
Stryker, DePuy Synthes (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson) and Smith & Nephew, which are also collectively
referred to herein as “Big Four”) held an estimated global consolidated market share of approximately 75% in
shoulder, knee and hip, based on 2019 data.

**_Global Market Share (Shoulder, Knee and Hip), 2019 (% Total)_**

_Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021). Analysis based on Orthoworld estimation for shoulder, knee and_
_hip combined in our key markets._

These larger competitors generally have a broad product portfolio, a significant amount of clinical data,
high levels of regulatory expertise, economies of scale and are characterized by relatively high profitability. Their
sales force, surgeon relationships and presence in hospitals provide them with the ability to bundle products and
offer volume-based discounts. At the same time, however, we believe smaller, more focused customers like
shoulder and elbow surgeons are not the primary focus of larger, multinational companies, and this offers an
attractive growth and margin opportunity for smaller companies like us. While larger competitors often use
acquisitions to maintain and strengthen their market position, we believe that smaller, more agile companies can
have a competitive edge and look for opportunities to differentiate themselves through a high degree of innovation,
responsiveness to surgeon-customer needs, and selective positioning in niche products and services. For example,
our 3D design and 3D printing center for custom-made complex solutions at HSS differentiate us from, and gives
us an advantage over, our larger competitors.

_Group estimation in our key markets; “smaller players” includes, among others, Limacorporate, Exactech, DJO, Medacta, Microport and_
_Link._

We believe we are a challenger in the global orthopedics market and possess the potential to increase
market share in the coming years thanks to the strength of our competitive positioning in the fast-growing shoulder
segment and our differentiated, non-commoditized product offering in large joints as well as our custom-made
solutions ProMade franchise.

As shown in the charts below, we benefit from a much larger exposure to the fast-growing shoulder
segment (39% of 2019 revenue) than the key “Big Four” players in the global orthopedic market (11% weighted
average exposure to shoulder based on 2019 revenue). On the other hand, compared to these four large
multinational competitors, a bigger share of our revenue comes from Europe, mainly driven by our consolidated
presence in Italy, our home market. Going forward we have a key strategic focus on expansion in the U.S., where
we already hold top ten positions in all three market segments (shoulder, knee and hip).

Based on management data (including data analyzed by a global management consulting company), we
have a strong presence in the global shoulder segment, with approximately 3-5% market share, ranking among
the top six companies with respect to market position globally in 2019. We are the top shoulder player in Italy
(approximately 37% market share in 2019) and were ranked among the top five companies in Germany, the UK,
France and Australia in 2019.

In the knee segment, we ranked among the top eight companies in 2019 with respect to market position
globally in 2019 (less than 1% global market share in 2019). We have a strong knee presence in Europe and were
ranked among the top five players in Italy (approximately 4% market share in 2019).

In the hip segment, we were ranked among the top eight players with respect to market position globally
in 2019 (approximately 1-2% market share in 2019). In Italy, we were ranked second top player in the hip segment,
with approximately 12% market share in 2019.

**Barriers to entry**

The orthopedic market in which we operate presents high barriers to potential new entrants:

    - _Regulatory environment: the regulatory environment for orthopedic implants requires significant_
investments and expertise to adhere to strict global standards, with substantial time, resources and
data needed to secure approvals and acceptance of quality standards by regulatory bodies and
clinicians; for example, the EU Medical Devices Regulation which became applicable on May 26,
2021 in Europe imposes a stricter certification process with heightened clinical data requirements

151


-----

and equivalence to predicate devices. Compliance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation will
present a barrier to those companies that do not already have the extensive clinical data required.

- _Required investment in innovation and technology: advanced technological product enhancements_
and an increased focus on digital / computer-assisted procedures require significant investment in
innovation and systems to facilitate shifting surgical needs.

- _Intellectual property: developing or acquiring patents is needed to differentiate the product offering_
in the market from commoditized implants and solutions, as well as to keep a competitive edge and
gain first-mover advantage (increasingly important for software and digital solutions); for example,
as of September 30, 2022, we owned 157 patents and had 155 patent applications pending and we
have, in the past, successfully defended our intellectual property (see “Business—Intellectual
_Property”)._

- _Customer and provider relationships: critical need to develop and maintain long-term relationships_
and partnerships with surgeons, hospitals, third-party payors and regulatory agencies.

- _Provider consolidation trends:_ hospital and provider group consolidation across markets has
resulted in increased pressure on supply chains and product purchasing decisions, further increasing
orthopedic companies’ competition for available market share.

###### • Shift to outpatient care setting: tailored strategies required to best address an ongoing shift in
procedures performed in an outpatient setting, such as streamlined trays, given the increased use of
ambulatory surgery centers.

Our headquarters are located in Villanova di San Daniele del Friuli in north-eastern Italy. We operate
two state-of-the-art production sites in Italy (Villanova di San Daniele and Segesta). In addition, the new ProMade
Point-of-Care (“PoC”) Center, operated by us on the Hospital for Special Surgery (“HSS”) main campus in New
York City, became operational in March 2021. Our innovative orthopedics portfolio, expertise in design and
engineering, and excellence in advanced manufacturing, combined with our agile operations and global
commercial reach, have established us as a key player in the orthopedic joint replacement market. Based on
management data (including industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management
consulting company), we have a strong presence in the global shoulder segment, with approximately 3-5% market
share, ranking among the top six companies with respect to market position globally in 2019. We are the top
shoulder player in Italy (approximately 37% market share in 2019) and were ranked among the top five companies
in Germany, the UK, France and Australia and among the top ten companies in the U.S.in 2019.

We have a team of approximately 140 professionals (as of December 31, 2021) focusing on research,
product and software design, often in partnership with renowned orthopedic surgeons at our Research &
Innovation (“R&I”) Center and Advanced Laboratory for Testing & Analysis (“ATLAs”), at our headquarters
and at our Digital Center of Excellence in Knoxville, Tennessee. In March 2021, we opened our ProMade PoC

(also known as “additive manufacturing”) facility for custom complex implants in a hospital setting. Additionally,
our standard practice is to seek patent protection for the intellectual property technical solutions relevant to our
business, and as of September 30, 2022, we owned 157 patents and had 155 patent applications pending.

The figure below illustrates certain of our products and solutions grouped by categories and geographies
and their contribution to our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.

**Product Mix** **Geographic Mix**

**History**

We have a long history of more than 75 years in the orthopedic industry dating back to 1945 when Carlo
Lualdi invented our first surgical instruments. We have over time become a global orthopedic company.

154


-----

We were a pioneer of titanium manufacturing in Italy. When we began producing orthopedic implants
in the 1970s, quality controls of medical devices were limited. In line with our aerospace industrial heritage, we
decided to apply control standards from our aerospace expertise. This cross application of standards and focus on
quality control led us to have a stringent control process often before regulators made such processes mandatory.
Today, we still aim to stay ahead of the curve for implant quality.

Over the years, we achieved nationwide recognition in Italy and accelerated our international expansion,
delivering strong organic growth. In 2015, we acquired a business line from Zimmer related to the production and
distribution of a knee prostheses (Zimmer Unicompartimental Knee (ZUK)) and a business line from Biomet
related to the elbow prosthesis (Biomet Discovery Elbow (Discovery)). These acquisitions provided a highly
complementary and well-established product portfolio and a broad customer base, strengthening our competitive
position in Europe and Japan. In the same year, we also launched our Physica knee system, which further cemented
our market position in that segment.

In March 2016, EQT, a purpose-driven global investment organization focused on active ownership
strategies, Loreda, an investment vehicle of Hansjörg Wyss (former owner of Synthes, now DePuy Synthes, an
orthopedics manufacturer which was acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2012) and the management team
completed the acquisition of our entire share capital from the previous shareholders.

In September 2018, we announced the milestone-based acquisition of TechMah Medical LLC
(“TechMah”), a digital solutions medical device company, to complement our hardware portfolio with digital
applications.

In 2016, we started our strong partnership focused on 3D printing with HSS in New York City, one of
the leading orthopedic hospitals in the U.S., under which we have created what we believe is the first on-site
design and 3D printing facility for custom complex implants in a hospital setting, which was announced in January
2019. In March 2021, the ProMade PoC Center became operational, with the first case performed in December
2021.

In 2020, we obtained approval from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for our Investigational
Device Exemption (“IDE”) to initiate the SMR Stemless Reverse clinical trial in the U.S., marking the first IDE
in our history. In April 2021, the first surgical case was performed as part of the U.S. clinical trial.

In 2022, we began fulfilling direct sale orders from our new subsidiaries in China and Canada (opened
in 2021), expanding our international presence and geographic reach.

**Our Business Model**

Our business model consists of the following phases: (i) Research and Development, (ii) Manufacturing,
(iii) Procurement, (iv) Customers and Sales and (v) Medical Education. The following graphic sets forth the
chronology of the sales of our products, from research and development to point-of-sale:

155


-----

- **Research & Development: Through our world-class in-house R&D team, we seek to remain at the forefront**
of innovation by developing new products and enhancing our current product portfolio. Our R&D team
works side by side with our product marketing team and is focused on improving surgical outcomes by
designing clinically differentiated products with cutting-edge technology for both primary and revision
surgeries, with a particular focus on driving digitization in the orthopedic industry. With the ultimate goal
of addressing unmet clinical needs, we often pursue multiple product solutions for a particular application
in order to offer surgeons the options and flexibility to use their preferred procedural technique with the
understanding that one solution does not work for every case.

We have a dedicated team of engineers at our R&I Center and ATLAs in our headquarters in Villanova di
San Daniele, Italy focused on hardware, as well as digital engineers at the Center of Excellence for Software
in Knoxville, Tennessee, focused on the development of innovative technology solutions. The R&I Center
leverages 3D printing expertise to accelerate the development of new and innovative orthopedic implant
solutions. ATLAs engages in experimental verification and simulation of new and innovative materials,
production processes and orthopedic solutions to better evaluate implants prior to market release. Both the
R&I Center and ATLAs enhance the collaboration between all departments and surgeons, providing support
to all aspects of new product development. These establishments aim to grow into an attractive site for
scientists, surgeons, and potential partners by representing opportunity for the orthopedic, industrial, and
academic worlds.

- **Manufacturing: The design and manufacturing of implants takes place at our two state-of-the-art**
manufacturing sites in Italy in coordination with our global R&D team, with instrument set production
partially outsourced where efficient. As a vertically integrated company, we are able to control the vast
majority of the production chain, from machining to finishing, coating, clean room and packaging, which
allows us to manage the quality and flexibility of production. Where appropriate, after receiving regulatory
clearance or approval for our products to be sold without restriction, we conduct a limited distribution of our
products, allowing us to trial new technology such as instrument sets with a select set of customers—this
allows us to further gather practical feedback and make necessary changes to our products, such as to
instrument sets, before launching products on a full scale (“Controlled Release”).

- **Procurement: As a result of our vertically integrated production structure, we mainly purchase raw materials**
and certain semi-finished products from external suppliers and other minor services, such as sterilization.
We also purchase the majority of our instrument sets from specialized third-party vendors.

- **Customers and Sales: Our sales model allows us to meet the needs of our broad customer base. We have**
three types of customers: (i) public institutions, including hospitals (often organized in Group Purchase
Organizations (“GPOs”), through tenders in certain countries), private clinics (also often organized in
GPOs) and Ambulatory Surgery Centers (“ASCs”) which we serve directly and reach with in-market

capabilities, (ii) distributors and (iii) other orthopedic companies. Our top ten clients represented
approximately 10%, 11% and 9% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021,
respectively, and our public institutions customers, including hospitals, represented 34%, 31% and 35% of
our revenues for the year ended as of December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our direct sales force
composed of sales representatives, non-stocking distributors, agents and sub-agents calls directly on public
hospitals, private clinics and ASCs. In case of direct sales, we invoice the end-customers. We also leverage
an indirect network of distributors, in selected markets, to whom we sell implants as well as, in most cases,
instrument sets. The distributors then sell and invoice the end-customers. Finally, we have a few OEM
customers to whom we sell components.

 - **Medical Education: We believe in offering surgeons more than a simple medical education course, but also**
access to a community. We support surgeons with their need for ongoing professional improvement by
providing valuable learning opportunities. Each surgeon has different needs and different requirements and
we tailor their education path to these needs through specific programs. This is a key driver in customer
engagement, for both new customer acquisition and customer retention. Our medical education path includes
traditional courses, SkillsLabs, which provide fundamental hands-on opportunities for surgeons and a
particular curriculum for younger surgeons to develop the key opinion leaders of the future. Other unique
opportunities we provide are called “Surgeon-to-Surgeon” training where experts in excellence centers host
surgeons in their operating room and share their experience and knowledge on a specific topic. The different
services we can provide which can support a surgeon directly in their operating room to face new or different
cases are also key to our customer acquisition strategy. Our program “Reverse Surgeon-to-Surgeon,” aims
to provide that service and we send an expert surgeon to work side by side with them, in their operating
room offering direct proctoring during a case. In the operating room, customized instrument sets, cases and
trays are provided to surgeons along with implants. We collaborate closely with surgeons to provide on-site
training and support at each stage of the surgical process. We also conduct trainings at medical schools,
which helps foster surgeons’ appreciation for our products and strengthens our cooperation with medical
school professionals.

**_Research & Development_**

Through our world-class in-house R&D team, we seek to remain at the forefront of innovation by
developing new products and enhancing our current product portfolio. Our R&D team works side by side with
our product marketing team and is focused on improving surgical outcomes by designing clinically differentiated

multiple product solutions for a particular application in order to offer surgeons the options and flexibility to use
their preferred procedural technique with the understanding that one solution does not work for every case.

Thanks to the use of the EBM technique which enables us to realize our TT technology, we have
consistently achieved the production of highly sophisticated and custom-made solutions. Employing our 3D
printing in manufacturing processes, we are able to achieve custom-made configurations that exceed the limits of
traditional machining production processes to realize designs that provide surgeons with a solution to highly
complex orthopedic cases.

We have a dedicated team of engineers at our R&I Center and ATLAs in our headquarters in Villanova
di San Daniele, Italy focused on hardware, as well as digital engineers at the Center of Excellence for Software in
Knoxville, Tennessee, focused on the development of innovative technology solutions. The R&I Center leverages

the collaboration between all departments and surgeons, providing support to all aspects of new product
development. These establishments aim to grow into an attractive site for scientists, surgeons, and potential
partners by representing opportunity for the orthopedic, industrial, and academic worlds.

Our R&D team consists of approximately 140 professionals with significant experience and degrees in
mechanical engineering, biomedical and aerospace engineering, materials science, and physics. We invest in R&D
focusing on our strategic priorities. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our expenses
attributable to R&D (capitalized and expensed) amounted to €15.3 million, €16.3 million and €18.0 million,
respectively.

157


-----

Our internal R&D team works closely with key opinion leaders and a global network of physicians,
medical personnel, R&D-oriented surgery centers and universities to ensure that we have broad access to
best-in-class ideas and technologies. For example, in March 2021, the ProMade PoC Center at HSS, which we
believe to be the first design and 3D printing facility for custom complex implants in a hospital setting, became
operational.

Agreements with universities include the services contract signed in March 2021 with Queensland
University.

**_Manufacturing_**

We have a state-of-the-art, highly automated manufacturing set-up that provides high quality, precise
and consistent manufacturing with a cost-competitive manufacturing footprint. We currently operate two
production facilities in Italy, which have been audited by multiple notified bodies, as well as the FDA. In June
2018, we completed the expansion of our facility in Villanova di San Daniele. In addition, the new ProMade PoC
Center, operated by us on the HSS main campus in New York City, became operational in March 2021.

As a vertically integrated company, we are able to control the vast majority of the production chain, from
machining to finishing, coating, clean room and packaging, which allows us to manage the quality and flexibility
of production.

Instrument sets are sourced externally as well as polyethylene components, ceramic components and
knee femoral components for which our activities start with the cleaning process.

The majority of our implants are manufactured internally following the various stages of the production
process outlined in the chart below.

Our manufacturing process typically start from casted or forged semi-finished components made of
titanium or CoCr alloy which are processed through turning, milling and polishing processes. For these processes
we mostly utilize computer numerical controlled (“CNC”) machines as well as polishing machines. In order to
improve manufacturing efficiencies, cost and quality, we employ computer-assisted robots as well as automating
certain manufacturing and inspection processes. Following the machining stage, products move to coating, where
required, cleaning, packaging and sterilization. For our 3D printed products, we start directly from the powder
which is used to manufacture the semi-finished components through a 3D printing process. These 3D printed
semi-finished products then undergo the standard manufacturing process of the casted and forged semi-finished
components. Certain products such as our TT cones do not require machining and coating thus going from the
Additive Manufacturing stage to the Clean Room, thereby reducing production costs of those products.

Our integrated manufacturing process enables us not only to act flexibly with a short lead time but also
to ensure a consistent quality in our products while managing costs appropriately. As is customary in the
orthopedic business, a portion of our product inventory is located at customers’ premises on consignment and
available for customers’ immediate use. We normally ship a complete set of prostheses and the corresponding
instrument sets to every surgeon and hospital that utilizes our products in their surgeries. In some countries, such
as the U.S., each set of prostheses that we send on consignment generally contains two pieces for every individual
product to provide backup. As surgeries are performed on a daily basis, customers send us a list of our products
utilized during the course of that day and we process those orders for the corresponding replacement parts and

158


-----

send these within 24 hours. With regular monitoring of stock usage, we are able to quickly adjust our production
to demand and manage our stock levels efficiently.

Our manufacturing facilities meet all relevant medical device industry standards and are certified
according to ISO 13485, the global standard for medical device quality systems ensuring high quality products,
processes and related customer support.

_Production Facilities_

We own two production facilities in Italy.

The following table sets forth selected information about our production facilities, including
manufacturing processes and main products produced at each location:

**Site** **Size (in m[2])** **Manufacturing Processes** **Manufactured Products**


Villanova di San Daniele, Italy ............. 7,545 Machining; Coating; Clean
Room; Packaging; Storage
Shipping

Segesta, Italy.......................................... 1,900 3D printing (EBM); Hipping;

Shoulder (Stems);
Hip (Acetabular cups, heads);
Knee (Tibial plates)


Our Research & Innovation (R&I) Center and ATLAs in our headquarters cover in aggregate an area of
1,105 square meters. Our Digital Center of Excellence in Knoxville, Tennessee covers an area of 1,138 square
meters.

In addition, we also operate the ProMade Point-of-Care Center on the main campus of the Hospital for
Special Surgery in New York City.

**_Procurement_**

As a result of our vertically integrated production structure, we mainly purchase raw materials and certain
semi-finished products from external suppliers and other minor services, such as sterilization. We also purchase
the majority of our instrument sets from specialized third-party vendors. We believe we have a well-balanced and
dependable supplier base (as of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not experienced supply chain
disruptions in 2022), primarily concentrated in western Europe.

_Raw materials and Semi-Finished Products_

Our principal raw materials are titanium, titanium powders, polyethylene and ceramic. The principal
semi-finished products we source externally are forged products, casted products and instrument sets components.
We value our strong relationships with suppliers and we have worked to establish closer ties with the key ones to
ensure high quality services and products, as well as cost efficiency. Our top five suppliers of raw materials and
semi-finished products accounted for 75%, 75% and 77% of our total costs of materials and raw materials in 2021,
2020 and 2019, respectively, but no supplier accounted for more than 23%, 21% and 23% of purchases. Costs of
materials and semi-finished products represented only 14%, 17% and 16% of our total costs of sales for the years
ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and have therefore only limited impact on sales. More
than two-thirds of our costs of materials (including instrument sets) are denominated in euro with the remainder
in foreign currencies, primarily U.S. dollars and New Zealand dollars. All raw materials are sourced from selected
companies located mainly in Italy, France, Germany and UK, which ensures, we believe, high quality control over
the supply chain.

We generally do not enter into long-term commitment contracts with our suppliers; rather we typically
enter into framework agreements as a basis for individual orders. The term of such framework agreements
typically varies from 24 to 36 months and in most cases the framework agreements do not contain any firm
purchase commitments. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry and Business—We may be unable to
_maintain positive working relationships with healthcare professionals, such as surgeons, healthcare providers_
_and medical school professionals.”_

_Instrument sets_

We design internally the instrument sets, which include the tools necessary to implant prostheses and
outsource their production. Different instrument sets are developed and supplied with our various products and
product lines. We believe that the supply of our instrument sets to surgeons and hospitals has a positive impact
on our sales as instrument sets are the necessary tools for surgeons to implant our products. In the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, we spent €14.9 million, €17.4 million and €15.1 million, respectively, on the
purchase of new instrument components and instrument sets. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, our investment
in instruments sets increased in 2020 and 2021 in anticipation of the market rebounding and the number of
surgeries increasing as the effects of the pandemic begin to subside. In line with industry practice, we supply
surgeons with instrument sets along with our implants on a consignment basis, so they can have prostheses readily
available for surgery. Instrument sets provided to hospitals and surgeons generally depreciate over the course of
five years, although in some cases can last longer before they need to be replaced.

Given the significant investment involved, we have a strict process to approve and reallocate instruments
sets within and across countries with the objective of maximizing return. One of the key parameters we use in this
process is the Turns-Per-Set (“TPS”) ratio, defined as the number of implants performed with an instrument set
over a period of one year, which we constantly track with the support of digital applications. The TPS ratio
combined with the local profitability allows us to prioritize investments.

We believe that instrument sets are of paramount importance for our sales process. Given the specific
nature of our implants, instrument sets can be used only for specific products. We work closely with surgeons and
other medical professionals by providing instrument sets and the necessary training to use our implants. We also
conduct trainings and provide instrument sets to medical schools, where we teach medical students how to use
our instruments and implants, fostering relationships with new surgeons as well as strengthening relationships
with medical school professionals. Once the surgeon is trained to use a certain instrument set, switching suppliers
of orthopedic products could be labor-intensive and costly for many of our customers.

**_Customers and Sales_**

We have three types of customers: (i) public institutions, including hospitals (often organized in GPOs,
through tenders in certain countries), private clinics (also often organized in GPOs) and ASCs which we serve
directly and reach with in-market capabilities, (ii) distributors and (iii) other orthopedic companies. Our top ten
clients represented 10%, 11% and 9% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021,
respectively and our public institutions customers, including hospitals, represented for the year ended as of
December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 represented, respectively, 34%, 31% and 35% of our revenues.

_Direct Sales_

Our direct sales network is composed of sales representatives, non-stocking distributors, agents and
sub-agents who call directly on public hospitals and private clinics. Their primary contact point is the orthopedic
surgeon who has a strong role in the purchasing decision. However, there are other stakeholders in this process
who are gaining more and more importance over time. As an example, Group Purchasing Organizations and
Tenders managed mostly by hospital administrators are often the only way to enter a specific center. In certain
countries insurance companies also play an important role as they reimburse only select implants.

We have a balanced mix of customers, which we have developed steadily over the years, ranging from
public hospitals to private hospitals, ASCs and independent clinicians. The overall split between public and private
customers varies across regions. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2021 the public sector represented
approximately 55% and the private sector represented 45% in Italy, while during the same period, in countries
such as the U.S., our private customer base was significantly larger than our public customer base.

Although some of our customers (such as hospitals) do not enter into long-term commitment contracts
with us, we have been able to maintain and grow our customer base as a result of their increased familiarity with
our implants and the high quality and reliability of our products. We have a high rate of customer retention, with
92.0% of our top 50 customers and 80.0% of our top ten extremities customers in 2019 remaining our customers
in 2021.

We frequently organize international and local training events (including the option of distance learning)
and medical training for surgeons in collaboration with local product managers and key opinion leaders. We
believe these events represent an opportunity for the participants to learn how to use our products and instrument
sets and for us to have a direct dialogue with the surgeons, understand their needs and discuss their proposals.

160


-----

_Distributors_

We have a global network of distributors across 26 countries through which we sell inventory, implants
and instrument sets. The distributor markets allow rapid growth in share without long lead time for investment in
sales infrastructure. We usually use national distributors in countries where we do not have our own entity,
supporting with local key contacts and regulatory knowledge.

_OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer)_

We supply our products to other implant manufacturers. This arrangement is sometimes driven by
regulatory factors, for example, where an OEM lacks regulatory approval for its own products in certain countries.

**_Medical Education_**

We believe in offering surgeons more than a simple medical education course, but also access to a
community. We support surgeons in their quest for ongoing professional improvement by providing valuable
learning opportunities. Each surgeon has different needs and different requirements and we tailor their education
path to these needs through specific programs. This is a key driver in customer engagement, for both new customer
acquisition and customer retention.

Our medical education path includes traditional courses, SkillsLabs, which provide fundamental
hands-on opportunities for surgeons and a particular curriculum for younger surgeons to develop the key opinion
leaders of the future.

Other unique opportunities we provide are called “Surgeon-to-Surgeon” training where experts in
excellence centers host surgeons in their OR and share their experience and knowledge on a specific topic. The
different services we can provide which can support a surgeon directly in their operating room to face new or
different cases are also key to our customer acquisition strategy. Our program “Reverse Surgeon-to-Surgeon,”
aims to provide that service and we send an expert surgeon to work side by side with them, in their operating
room offering direct proctoring during a case.

Our medical education offering has expanded significantly on the digital front, using new technologies
to connect labs and operating rooms around the world for training and remote proctoring with state of the art
visualization.

Within our digital process, we also offer virtual factory tours in our headquarters in Villanova di San
Daniele, Italy. These tours are organized live and tailored for each surgeon to allow them to experience how we
approach manufacturing and development. In person visits to the factory were put on hold during the COVID-19
pandemic but we have now re-opened our doors to surgeon visitors.

We frequently organize international and local training events (including the option of distance learning)
and medical training for surgeons in collaboration with local product managers and key opinion leaders. In 2020,
at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we organized 40 courses for surgeons alone. We further organized over
70 courses in 2021 and we intend to continue increasing the number of courses we offer and surgeons trained
going forward.

We manage all of our surgeon engagements through an online platform for maximum transparency and
tracking from a compliance perspective.

We have operations throughout the world and manage our operations through five main geographic areas:
Europe (excluding Italy), Italy, APAC, the United States and Other (including Turkey, Russia, Middle East and
Africa, Latin America and Canada). In order to optimize capital allocation and instrument efficiency we prioritize
our attractive markets. One of the key parameters we use to reallocate instruments within or outside the country
is the TPS ratio, defined as the number of implants performed with an instrument set over a period of one year,
which we constantly track with the support of digital applications.

Our broad geographic platform results in a high level of diversification, including in terms of type of
third party payors with a prevalence of government reimbursement in Europe and private insurances in the United
States.

The following table sets forth our revenue by each geographic area for the years ended December 31,
2019, 2020 and 2021.

**Revenue by Geographic Segment**

**2019** **2020** **2021**

_€ / million_ _%_ _€ / million_ _%_ _€ / million_ _%_

Italy....................... 47.6 21.4% 37.0 19.1% 42.2 19.8%

Europe (excluding
Italy)................. 76.7 34.4% 63.9 32.9% 79.0 37.1%

**Revenue................** **222.8** **100%** **194.0** **100%** **212.8** **100%**

We started to expand our sales beyond Italy to elsewhere in Europe in 2000 and, as of the date of this
offering memorandum, we have operations in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France,
Germany, The Netherlands, Portugal, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and the UK, in
addition to Italy. We started our expansion in the APAC region in 2003 and now have sales in Japan, Australia,
South Korea and New Zealand. We aim to continued expansion within the APAC region as part of our business
strategy. We started our expansion in the U.S. in 2012 focusing in increasing our market share in traditionally
profitable markets such as the U.S. We also sell our products in other geographies, namely Turkey, Russia, Middle
East & Africa, Latin America and Canada, which we account for under Rest of the World.

**Sales and Marketing**

We market and sell our products globally, through direct and indirect sales forces, comprising 208 direct
employees and 231 sales agents as of December 31, 2021, compared to 226 direct employees and 211 sales agents
as of December 31, 2020 and 242 direct employees and 186 sales agents as of December 31, 2019. From our
headquarters in Italy, we deliver directly to certain direct customers and distributors, but we also rely on our
subsidiaries to distribute our products. Through our global sales network, we are able to serve customers in 51
countries and monitor client satisfaction.

We utilize a global approach to sales force training (including digital learning option), corporate
marketing, brand positioning and medical education to provide consistent, high quality service. Our sales and
marketing strategies are geared to adapt to local requirements of each region and, therefore, in response to the
different healthcare systems throughout the world, our organizational structures differ by country. For the year
ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 we derived 86%, 84% and 85% of our revenue through our direct
network of sales representatives and sales agents, with our indirect sales, distributor network and OEM sales
accounting for the remainder of our revenues for the period (with OEMs accounting 5% of our revenue as of
December 31, 2021, compared to 7% of our revenues as of December 31, 2020 and 5% as of December 31, 2019).

Despite the growing influence of hospital administrations and their efforts to contain costs, surgeons in
the orthopedics market still play a significant part in the decision-making process. While the safety of the implant
represents one of the most important factors surgeons take into account, surgeons also value the reliability and
ease of use of the products as well as the training and medical education. Our prepared and trained sales personnel
and easy to use instrument sets are key for our positioning. In particular, during more complex surgeries, the
technical know-how and expertise of sales personnel is highly regarded as they can provide valuable advice. As
a result, we invest a significant amount of time in training sales representatives in how to use specific products
and how to provide surgeons with valuable education on our product features and uses. Our sales force
representatives have strong technical skills and medical education to provide technical support to surgeons. In
2020, we focused on the further digitization of our sales process in order to maintain our relationships with key
opinion leaders and other strategic customers throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Sales and Non-Sales Training_

Training represents a strategic lever for the growth of our people and gives us a competitive advantage.
The three objectives which guide our training plan development for all our stakeholders are to inspire our people
with the reasons why we are in the orthopedic business, provide information and guidelines and provide a
personalized and continuous learning process to accelerate the adequate preparation to provide the market to a
high level of service.

In-person courses, online training through Lima Genius, our eLearning platform, product training for
sales representatives with different sessions, practical exercises and surgery simulations, are some examples of
what we offer, on both a global and local level.

162


-----

Internal courses are organized for the engineers and for the marketing team and include operating room
experiences to enable them to witness our products in action and see the ultimate purpose of their work: to improve
patient’s lives. This experience provides significant value and motivation to those who are involved in new
product development and in providing service to surgeons.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Leading presence in stable and resilient markets with exposure to attractive and fast growing segments of_**
**_orthopedics underpinned by favorable fundamental long-term trends_**

We operate in the large and global orthopedics market, which is characterized by historically resilient
and stable growth, underpinned by favorable demographic and secular trends. We carry a broad product portfolio
of orthopedic implants, focusing on product lines that offer relatively higher value in terms of expected market
growth. We specifically focus on what we identify as high value-add products, namely products for the extremities
segment (shoulder and elbow), hip and knee “revision” implants (which replace existing implants, as opposed to
“primary,” _i.e. first-time implants), ProMade custom solutions manufactured for revision and other complex_
primary surgeries and Trabecular Titanium 3D printed devices.

For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 55.4%, 54.4% and 54.0% of our revenue were
derived from what we refer to as “high value-add” products, namely:

    - products for the high-growth extremities segment, which, for the year ended December 31, 2021
represented 35.3% of our revenue (excluding TT 3D printed products and custom implants, which
are accounted for under a different product line), compared to 34.7% for the year ended December
31, 2020 and 34.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019; the shoulder market is projected to grow
at a CAGR of 5.0% to 5.5% from 2019 to 2025, according to industry and market data elaborated in
September 2021 by a global management consulting company;

    - hip and knee revision implants, which, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we estimate
represented 6.8% of our revenue (excluding TT 3D printed products and custom implants),
compared to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 7.6% for the year ended December
31, 2019; based on our experience in the market, this type of product is generally priced 30% higher
than primary implants due to its inherent complexity;

    - custom implants, which represented 1.7% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 1.5% for the year ended December
31, 2019; this market, in which we hold a leading position thanks to our ProMade products, is
projected to grow at a CAGR of 8% to 12% 2019 and 2025, according to industry and market data
analyzed by a global management consulting company; and

    - our TT 3D printed differentiated technology, which generates higher profit margins compared to our
standard products and represented 11.6% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 10.5% for the year ended December
31, 2019.

We plan to continue growing our presence in these segments. Our differentiated 3D printed TT implants
position us to benefit from the shift to outpatient clinics and ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”) (mainly present
in the United States) for less complex, routine orthopedic procedures, a trend that has been further accelerated by
the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe we are well prepared for the shift toward ASCs and we are in the process
of developing pilot offerings with ASC-based surgeons and managers (for example, the streamlining of trays (part
of our instrument sets) and co-marketing initiatives).

We operate in the large and attractive global orthopedic implants market, underpinned by strong
fundamentals, valued at approximately $45.5 billion in 2019 and project to grow even further. According to
industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company, the
shoulder, knee and hip implants market in our key markets, the U.S., Italy, Germany, the UK, Australia, Japan

###### Shoulder, Knee and Hip Implant Market in our Key Markets, 2007-2025 ($Bn)

_Source: global management consulting company analysis (September 2021)._

Our market is expected to continue benefitting from favorable structural tailwinds, including the
following:

 - **Demographic factors: Demographic factors such as aging of the global population, increased levels of**
chronic diseases, rising levels of obesity worldwide (affecting younger and younger populations) and active
lifestyles, particularly in advancing years, as well as sports-related and other injuries, lead to greater wear
on joints and higher rates of degenerative diseases, which tends to support greater spending in the orthopedics
market.

 - **COVID-19 backlog: Due to the characteristics of a “product of need” and the importance of orthopedic**
devices in treating patients suffering from injuries to bones and joints or supporting soft tissue injuries, the
global orthopedic market historically has proven to be resilient, including during the recent global financial
crisis and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significantly, there is pent-up demand in the global
orthopedics market as a result of the postponement of a large number of non-emergency and elective
procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe will contribute to increased spending in the
orthopedics market over the medium-term until the demand for non-urgent procedures has been absorbed.

 - **Growth in high-value segments: The extremities market (particularly for shoulder implants, which is one**
of our core product lines), which generally benefits from higher profitability as compared to other segments,
is growing faster than the overall global orthopedic implants market, with joint prostheses being the fastest
growing segment at a CAGR of approximately 5.0% to 5.5% between 2019 and 2025 (according to industry
and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company) and some key
geographical areas growing even faster. For instance, the orthopedic implant market for joints in Australia,
one of our strongest geographies in APAC, was forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 3.0% to 3.5% between
2019 and 2025 (according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management
consulting company).

**_Innovative orthopedics portfolio with superior shoulder platform and revision portfolio supporting a well-_**
**_defined positioning in high-value segments with significant barriers to entry_**

We offer a broad range of innovative orthopedic devices across four product lines—extremities, knee,
hip and fixation and other devices. This range includes a comprehensive suite of implants geared towards stable
and mature orthopedic segments such as primary hip and knee implants, as well as niche higher-growth,
higher-margin segments such as our extremities product line, revision implants and custom-made products for
patients with orthopedic needs requiring highly complex surgeries. Further, our portfolio includes specialized
products, featuring innovative prosthetic implants for joint reconstruction using state-of-the-art technologies,
including 3D printing. Our product range includes implants for total joint replacements, whether for the first time
(primary implants) or to replace an existing implant (revisions).

-----

Given our product diversification, we benefit from our presence in higher-margin, higher-complexity
and less-commoditized orthopedic segments as well as the regular revenue stream from higher-volume, less
complex implants segments. Our differentiated positioning as a provider of customized solutions and implants for
more complex procedures has allowed us to outperform market growth. Our custom-made implants, tailored to
the specifications of individual patients facing highly complex orthopedic interventions, often replace bone
defects in revision or re-revision surgeries, and increase our recognition with both patients and surgeons by
providing a solution to highly complex procedures. We are particularly strong in the high-growth and high-margin
extremities market, which represented 40.2% and 39.7% of our revenue for the twelve months ended September
30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively, (compared to 37.8% for the year ended December
31, 2019), and, within our extremities product line, have developed the SMR, a leading line of modular shoulder
implants with 20 years of clinical follow-up history and over 160,000 implants sold worldwide since it was
launched in 2002. Our complete SMR shoulder platform is a differentiator in the market as it provides a complete
system for shoulder replacement across a full range of cases and continuum of care. It is a reliable and easy-to-use
system for surgeons, and was the first to obtain a 10A Orthopedic Data Evaluation Panel (“ODEP”) rating for
SMR Reverse in 2017.

We believe that the future growth of our shoulder product sub-segment will be characterized by
innovation and portfolio completion through ongoing product development. In particular, we are proud of our
in-house development of TT, our proprietary, patented materials technology that is 3D printed using titanium
alloys and that has an ideal porosity, promoting bone growth and integration. We utilize our TT technology in
both off-the-shelf as well as custom-made products, allowing us to address a range of orthopedic needs including
complex cases that require a bespoke solution. Our TT technology benefits from over 14 years of clinical data and
more than 182,000 implants sold worldwide to date. Using these and other innovative technologies, we have
recently successfully launched new products such as (i) the SMR Hybrid Glenoid, (ii) the SMR Lateralized
Connectors, (iii) the SMR Short Stem and (iv) the SMR TT Augmented 360 Glenoid.

In addition, we have several products in development, including the Prima Short Stem (which is in the
Controlled Release phase), the Prima TT glenoid and our Smart SPACE digital solutions for shoulder. Within
these digital solutions, we plan to launch the Lima Patient Specific Instruments (the “LPSI”) during the course of
2023, as an improved solution that allows surgeons to autosegment CT scans, plan cases and design 3D
positioners. We obtained approval from the FDA for our IDE to initiate the SMR Stemless Reverse clinical trial
in the U.S. and in April 2021, the first surgery was performed within the U.S. clinical trial. Stemless Anatomic
and Reverse are already approved in various countries outside of U.S. with positive clinical results. We have also
developed one of the first 3D printed modular elbow systems, leveraging our technical know-how and existing
relationships with surgeons, and we are currently developing a complete modular ankle system to complete a
full-suite extremities platform.

Beyond our expertise in the extremities product line, we benefit from a strong foundation in the hip and
knee segments, supported by a track record of clinical outcomes. As of the date of this offering memorandum, our
comprehensive portfolio of knee products includes (i) Physica ZUK, a single-compartment knee prosthetic
implant, which has shown excellent clinical results and lowest revision rates at 10 years (according to an analysis
by HQIP), and (ii) the Physica primary system for whole knee joint replacement. Our portfolio of hip products
includes (i) TT 3D printed acetabular cups which provide increased primary cup stability due to higher friction
co-efficient and secondary fixation through bone ingrowth, and (ii) cemented and cementless primary and revision
femoral stems. Recent launches in the knee segment include (i) the 3D printed Anatomic Metaphyseal Fixation
(“AMF”) TT Cones for complex primary and revision knee surgery, (ii) the new Physica VitE and LMC liners,
as well as (iii) the Physica Cementless Knee. We carry a large portfolio of hip stems covering various surgical
use cases, from primary to revision. Future launches are expected to include the High Posterior Stabilized (“HPS”)
Physica knee and the Physica Revision System (CCK and Hinge).

The segments in which we operate present high barriers to potential new entrants, which include the
following:

 - **Regulatory environment: The regulatory environment for orthopedic implants requires significant**
investments and expertise to adhere to strict global standards, with substantial time, resources and data
needed to secure approvals and acceptance of quality standards by regulatory bodies and clinicians. In
particular, the EU Medical Devices Regulation, which became applicable on May 26, 2021 in the EU,
imposes a stricter certification process with heightened clinical data requirements and equivalence to
predicate devices. Compliance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation will present a barrier to those
companies that do not already have the extensive clinical data required.

-----

 - **Required investment in innovation and technology: Advanced technological product enhancements and**
an increased focus on digital and computer-assisted procedures require significant investment in innovation
and systems to facilitate shifting surgical needs.

 - **Intellectual property: Developing or acquiring patents is needed to differentiate the product offering in the**
market from commoditized implants and solutions, as well as to keep a competitive edge and gain first-mover
advantage (increasingly important for software and digital solutions). Specifically, as of September 30, 2022
we have a total of 312 granted and pending patents and we have, in the past, successfully defended our
intellectual property.

 - **Customer and provider relationships: Critical need to develop and maintain long-term relationships and**
partnerships with surgeons, hospitals, third-party payors and regulatory agencies.

 - **Provider consolidation trends: Hospital and provider group consolidation across markets has resulted in**
increased pressure on supply chains and product purchasing decisions, further increasing orthopedic
companies’ competition for available market share.

 - **Shift to outpatient care setting: Tailored strategies required to best address an ongoing shift in procedures**
performed in an outpatient setting (such as streamlined trays), given the increased use of ambulatory surgery
centers.

**_Strong R&D platform, track record of innovation and new product launches based on engineering heritage_**
**_and surgeon collaboration_**

We have a world-class in-house R&D team consisting of approximately 140 professionals (as of
December 31, 2021) with extensive experience in biomedical engineering and other key areas of expertise. These
professionals are located at our Research & Innovation Center (“R&I Center”) and Advanced Laboratory for
Testing and Analysis (“ATLAs”) at our headquarters in Villanova di San Daniele, Italy, which is focused on
hardware, as well as at our Digital Center of Excellence in Knoxville, Tennessee, which is focused on digital
applications.

We have invested an aggregate of €49.6 million in R&D (capitalized and expensed) in the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The quality of our R&D team is evidenced by our recent innovative product
launches such as the SMR TT Hybrid Glenoid, the SMR lateralized connectors, the SMR short stem and the SMR
TT Augmented 360 Glenoid for the extremities segment and the AMF TT cones, the new Physica Vit E and LMC
liners and the Physica Cementless Knee (comprising a porous femoral component and TT Tibial plate printed in
3D) for the knee segment. We also have a robust new product development pipeline which we believe will result
in new product launches generating accelerated growth. This includes (i) the Prima Short Stem, the convertible
short stem implant following the latest surgical trends for the U.S. market, which is currently in the Controlled
Release phase, (ii) the Prima Glenoid component which incorporates our TT technology, (iii) the “Shoulder in a
Box” offering for the extremities segment, (iv) the Physica High Posterior Stabilized Liner, (vi) the full CCK and
Hinge revision system for the knee segment; and (vi) the new Revision Stem and TT Cranial Augments for the
hip segment.

We were among the first to use 3D-printing in orthopedics, with our first 3D-printed clinical product
implanted in 2007, and we have continued to increase and refine our expertise in the field to produce innovative
products. In particular, we leveraged our knowledge in 3D printing to create Trabecular Titanium, a proprietary,
advanced multiplanar cellular structure made entirely of commercial-grade titanium alloys which we use across
product lines to manufacture certain implants. Used in our implants, TT offers a scaffold for cell colonization and
bone tissue vascularization. Its optimal porosity and pore size promotes improved transportation of oxygen,
nutrients, ions and other bone-inducing factors, which favor the formation of new bone tissue around the
prosthesis, an outcome supported by pre-clinical testing. TT is one of our most advanced technologies, with no
limitation on shape in the design phase, and we intend to continue to leverage it to further diversify our product
portfolio and create cutting-edge new implants, such as the SMR TT Augmented 360 Glenoid in our shoulder
sub-segment. Additionally, our ProMade brand, through which we provide custom product solutions, combines
our experience in design, 3D printing and titanium processing, enabling us to develop patient-specific implants
and surgical guides for complex cases. We have also developed a web-based platform that provides and enhances
interaction and collaboration between surgeons and our engineers to design and produce custom-made solutions
for the most complex orthopedics cases.

166


-----

Our R&D team also maintains a long and consistent track-record of obtaining government-backed
research grants of approximately €1 million per annum during the last 20 years. We continued to invest in
innovation during the COVID-19 pandemic and, in 2021, we obtained 24 patent approvals and applied for 15 new
patents. As of September 30, 2022, we had 157 granted patents and had 155 patent applications pending. We
received regulatory authorizations and certifications for 50 products in 2021, which we believe reflects our strong
collaboration with regulators and ability to effectively manage the approval process of innovative products.

To complement our in-house R&D team, we also maintain and continue to establish relationships with
research institutions, leading surgeons, and hospitals globally, such as the HSS in New York City. In January
2019, we and the HSS (one of the leading orthopedic hospitals in the U.S., ranked by U.S. News as the leader in
U.S. for orthopedics for 12 consecutive years and top-ranked in orthopedics and rheumatology for 30 consecutive
years) announced the creation of what we believe is the first design and 3D printing facility for custom complex
implants in a hospital setting, at the point of care. The ProMade PoC Center, which was inaugurated and became
operational in March 2021, is operated by us on the HSS main campus in New York City and leverages the
combination of our advanced technology and experience, and HSS’ expertise in clinical care and biomechanical
engineering, as well as proximity to patients. The partnership increases the availability and speed of personalized
orthopedic care for patients with complex reconstruction cases in the U.S., reducing the time required during the
design and production phase.

Beyond the U.S., we work with major European orthopedic centers and universities such as University
College London and Wrightington Hospital in the UK and IRCCS Instituto Ortopedico Galeazzi in Italy. We have
also invested in clinical studies for long-term product life cycle sustainability and market access to certain key
geographies, such as Australia and the UK. We believe we are well-prepared for transitioning our legacy portfolio
products towards compliance with Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (the “EU Medical Devices Regulation”) which
became applicable on May 26, 2021 but includes a number of transitional provisions for certain medical devices
to comply with said regulation. Our structured Regulatory and Clinical Research Departments have anticipated
the need for quality control systems, regulated procedures and clinical data collection that are now required for
the EU Medical Devices Regulation. We remain at the forefront of technical development through our R&D team
and strategic partnerships with leading orthopedic innovators, which continue to drive our product pipeline.

We are also driving the digital transformation in orthopedics with our Smart SPACE digital solutions.
We received FDA clearances for the Smart SPACE shoulder planner and glenoid 3D positioner in November
2019, and the first case was performed in February 2020 followed by a Controlled Release. Our humeral 3D
positioner received FDA clearance in December 2020 and our Cubit Guidance product received FDA clearance
for assistance in the intraoperative positioning of shoulder implants used in certain shoulder arthroplasty
procedures in February 2021 (with the first case performed in March 2021). In 2023 we will launch the LPSI, an
improved solution that allows surgeons to autosegment CT scans, plan cases and design 3D positioners. We
believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing shift toward surgical navigation and robotics solutions.
New technologies launched in digitally-assisted surgery over recent years have shown high adoption rates and the
market for 3D planning and guidance solutions is projected to grow at approximately 8% to 12% CAGR between
2019 and 2025, according to market and industry data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management
consulting company.

**_Highly resilient financial profile with strong growth track record, supported by significant COVID-19 backlog_**

We demonstrated resilience and navigated through the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, including
related supply chain disruptions.

Given the essential nature of our business, we remained operational during the COVID-19 pandemic,
and were able to continue launching new products. For example, we launched the SMR Short Stem, the Physica
LMC liners and the Physica VitE liners, and started the Controlled Release of the AMF TT Cones, the TT
Augmented 360 and the cementless knee (comprising a porous femur component and a TT Tibial plate),
demonstrating our strong resilience and our ability to successfully adapt to the asymmetric trends recorded in the
markets in which we operate by leveraging the significant breadth of our product portfolio.

We demonstrated earnings resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, with our revenues declining by
12.9% between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, which was less than the approximately 15% to
20% decline in our (weighted) key markets of the U.S., Italy, Germany, UK, Australia, Japan, France (according
to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting company). The
following graphic sets forth details of our revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the
periods presented.

Since the stabilization of the pandemic, we have experienced a strong recovery supported by a backlog
of demand, resuming our pre-COVID-19 sales momentum. One of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic
was the postponement of a large number of non-emergency and elective procedures, as, among other factors, (i)
hospital capacity and healthcare resources were significantly re-routed to deal with patients suffering from
COVID-19, (ii) many hospitals and healthcare providers placed restrictions on the number and type of
non-emergency and elective procedures performed at their facilities, and (iii) many candidates for such procedures
preferred to minimize their exposure to clinical settings for fear of contracting COVID-19. For example, as of
February 2022, the British National Health Service estimated that 6.0 million people were on the waiting list for
planned service delivery, up from 4.4 million prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-urgent medical procedures
in the United States were also significantly disrupted, with providers in some parts of the country, such as Texas
and Florida, banning elective surgeries in 2020.

We believe there is significant pent-up demand for our products as a result of the lockdowns that
restricted elective procedures across our markets. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we estimate such
backlog to amount to over €60.0 million of sales for our business over the medium-term. As the capacity of
healthcare facilities and providers returns to, or exceeds, pre-COVID-19 levels, we believe this backlog will be
absorbed over the next few years, resulting in a de-risking of a significant portion of our future revenue growth.
During the pandemic, we continued to invest in the growth of our business and purchased inventory and instrument
sets, and spent on the development of new products (thereby increasing our working capital) in 2020, which we
believe will yield customer conversions and further growth in the business. We believe we are already seeing the
benefits of our preparedness to take advantage of this backlog, with revenue increasing by 16.2% to €180.5 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from €155.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2021.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant disruptions to ordinary course business practices across
commercial industries, including the medical device industry. Beyond decreased sales as a result of delayed
medical procedures, resulting in higher inventories across the industry, payment and delivery terms were extended
for market participants, their customers and their suppliers, resulting in working capital increases as inventories
remained on hand and as payables and receivables remained outstanding for relatively longer periods of time. In
connection with the post-pandemic rebound in commercial activity across our industry, we are experiencing an
encouraging normalization in our days sales outstanding (“DSO”) and days inventory outstanding (“DIO”), with
the foregoing trending back towards their pre-pandemic 2019 levels, aided by increased sales in geographies with
better payment terms, such as the United States. We also expect to similarly move towards normalizing our days

168


-----

payables outstanding (“DPO”) to pre-COVID-19 levels over the medium term. We expect these existing and
expected normalization trends to continue for the foreseeable future, contributing to further improvements to our
cash generation.

**_Industry-leading profitability on the back of rigorous cost management and disciplined resources allocation_**

We manage our business with a focus on achieving and maintaining strong revenue generation and
profitability. In particular, our high margins related to our strategic positioning across regular and high value-add
orthopedics segments have also allowed us to maintain consistently high Gross Margins of 74.8%, 74.3% and
74.0% on revenues of €222.8 million, €194.0 million and €212.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2020 and 2021, respectively, and a Gross Margin of 73.6% on revenue of €237.9 million as of and for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2022.

Importantly, we were able to progressively increase our Adjusted EBITDA Margin from 25.8% to 26.6%
between the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 by implementing a number of concurrent cost savings and
restructuring initiatives, and further increased our Adjusted EBITDA Margin to 29.6% for the year ended
December 31, 2021, which we believe positions us among the most profitable players in our industry.

We are committed to further improving our profitability based on operational efficiencies and various
strategic initiatives, such as:

 - optimizing efficiency by aiming to maintain high “turns-per-set” (defined as the number of implants
performed with an instrument set over a period of one year, which we constantly track with the support of
digital applications) in countries with lower average sales prices (“ASPs”) while accepting lower turns-perset in countries with higher ASPs, such as the high-margin U.S. market;

 - savings initiatives, such as price negotiation initiatives and the implementation of channel cost savings that
we accrued by lowering travel and medical conference costs during the COVID-19 pandemic;

 - continued development of state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies to boost flexibility, quality and
efficiency through manufacturing efficiency initiatives covering finishing, machining, coating, additive
manufacturing, packaging and clean rooms, including the following measures which resulted from a fiveyear manufacturing optimization program: (i) the digitalization of systems via automated data capture, (ii)
RFID usage on our raw materials to maintain visibility on our value chain, (iii) the implementation of
automated robotic labeling and packaging processes; and

 - continued focus on strategic sourcing to optimize our already well-balanced and dependable supplier base,
through initiatives such as concentrating suppliers in western Europe while reducing them in number
(minimizing lead times and mitigating disruption risks), implementing long-term agreements and multisourcing programs (for example, double-sourcing of our knee femoral casting, hip stem and knee tibial plate
forging, knee poly liner and primary packaging). As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have not
experienced supply chain disruptions in 2022.

**_Well-invested platform of scale with diversified presence across geographies_**

We have a state-of-the-art manufacturing network that we believe provides high-quality, precise and
consistent production. With the goal of minimizing human error and enhancing efficiencies, we leverage the
expertise of our long-standing employees with in-depth knowledge of manufacturing best practices to program
and continue to perfect our increasingly automated process, thereby integrating human experience with advanced
engineering processes. These factors, combined with our longstanding relationships with dependable suppliers,
allow for a highly efficient supply chain that is able to adapt quickly to changes in market demand. As of the date
of this offering memorandum, we have not experienced supply chain disruptions in 2022.

We believe we are among the largest 3D printing manufacturers in orthopedics. We have two
state-of-the-art, highly efficient production facilities in Italy. Our two production facilities have reached a high
level of automation, enabling us to respond more rapidly and flexibly to the requirements of our clients. Both
facilities are highly efficient with Overall Equipment Efficiency (“OEE”) and Overall Labor Efficiency (“OLE”)
above 80% in 2021. In June 2018, we completed the expansion of our facility in Villanova di San Daniele, thus
doubling our manufacturing capacity. More recently in 2020, we invested €3.5 million for a new clean room in
our facility in Villanova di San Daniele, which was completed in first quarter of 2021. We also benefit from our

169


-----

in-house state-of-the-art ATLAs testing lab in Villanova di San Daniele where we conduct in-house mechanical
and chemical testing supported by an industry 4.0 Web App to manage the process.

Our Capital Expenditures amounted to €122.5 million between 2019 and 2021, of which (i) €47.4 million
was linked to investments in instrument sets (which we expect to drive incremental revenue), (ii) €36.0 million
was used on property, plant and equipment, primarily to expand production capacity via new production and
manufacturing machinery, including new 3D printing facilities and a grey room plant, (iii) €19.2 million was
linked to the TechMah acquisition between 2019 and 2021 and (iv) €19.9 million was related to expenditures on
other intangibles, comprising start-up and expansion costs, R&D, development and costs related to patents and
intellectual property rights not otherwise attributable to TechMah’s integrated end-to-end digital surgery platform
(“Smart SPACE”). For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our investments were aimed
at implementing further growth and classified as Growth Capital Expenditures (i.e., discretionary expenditures)
while the remaining 20% consisted of maintenance investments and classified as Maintenance Capital
Expenditures, in line with approximately 80% and 20% for the year ended December 31, 2020. In the medium
term, we expect to benefit from our previous investments in our platform and to gradually reduce our Growth
Capital Expenditure as a result of the long life of the instruments sets deployed and the expected increase in turn
per sets. As such, we expect our yearly Maintenance Capital Expenditures over the medium-term to amount to
approximately €5-8 million, in line with historical levels, and our yearly Growth Capital Expenditures to remain
in the range of 5-10% of sales (with Growth Capital Expenditures trending towards the lower end of this range
assuming the completion of our discretionary expansion of production capacity at our Villanova di San Daniele
site in 2024, including a distribution center and additional manufacturing plant capacity).

These strong manufacturing capabilities benefit from an extensive global network that gives us proximity
to attractive local markets and a diversified footprint with sales across more than 50 countries. Our global
operations cover both mature markets and growing economies with 38.7% of our revenue generated in Europe
(excluding Italy), 19.6% in Italy, 17.1% in the United States, 16.0% in APAC and 8.6% in the Rest of the World
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. We operate through subsidiaries in 25 countries and serve 26
countries through distributors, and have expanded into seven new markets since 2012 (Belgium, Brazil, South
Korea, Poland, U.S., China and Canada).

As of December 31, 2021, we had 192 direct sales representatives globally. We have a strong footprint
in Europe, where we serve our clients in most cases directly through local managers and approximately 120 sales
representatives in addition to more than 80 agents. We also have an established presence in the U.S., the largest
global orthopedics market and a core focus for our growth initiatives.

Our robust set-up in the U.S. includes a sales force of approximately 150 sales representatives as of
December 31, 2021, demonstrating our strong existing local presence that establishes a foundation on which to
further expand and gain market share. We have demonstrated the ability to set up geographic coverage in the U.S.
and will build upon our strong local footprint that has already captured top 10 positions in certain segments such
as shoulder. Moreover, our partnership with the HSS to advance ProMade custom solutions and the innovation
center (acquired as part of the TechMah transactions) for digital applications development in Tennessee firmly
establish our local presence and will allow us to convert additional customers in the region. We also have a solid
presence in fast-growing APAC markets (including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea), with more
than 60 sales representatives. We are also expanding into China where we established a subsidiary in 2021.

To complement our growth, we have invested and plan to continue to strategically invest in new products
and in key geographies when attractive opportunities arise. We believe that we have significant expertise in
identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions, while remaining focused on our financial performance. It is
not our strategy to seek acquisitions purely to increase market share. Rather, we are focused on products and
technologies that we can manufacture and optimize, and on opportunities to obtain a foothold in important new
markets. We are also open to acquisitions in geographies where we have an increasing market presence to boost
growth and expand our footprint within that particular geography.

**_High-caliber management team with longstanding industry experience across the globe bringing together_**
**_superior technological capabilities and commercial know-how_**

We have a decentralized global structure with strong regional teams led by our global management team
from our headquarters in Italy and local general managers in our direct sales geographies. This decentralized
organization allows us to quickly react to market changes, fulfil orders rapidly and minimize wait times for
patients and surgeons. We also benefit from a flexible “go-to-market” setup with a direct and indirect presence
in, as well as an extensive and experienced sales force across, key orthopedic markets. This setup fosters

relationships with leading surgeons in their respective fields, totaling over 400 people. Including employees and
exclusive agents, we have over 400 direct sales globally including approximately 230 sales agents in the U.S. and
Italy, as of December 31, 2021. Further, by serving some markets with distributors, we are able to rapidly grow
market share without the long lead-time required for investment in sales infrastructure.

We benefit from the long-standing experience and industry know-how of our senior management team,
under the leadership of Massimo Calafiore, our Chief Executive Officer, who took the helm in September 2022.
Mr. Calafiore is an industry expert with deep experience in the orthopedic device industry. Before joining
Limacorporate, Mr. Calafiore served as the Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer of NuVasive,

for leading all commercial activities of the business, including NuVasive’s product marketing, commercial, and
commercial enablement functions, as well as its business units NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics and NuVasive
Clinical Services. Prior to his experience at NuVasive, Mr. Calafiore spent more than 15 years supporting and
leading the U.S. businesses of Waldemar Link, a leader in the orthopedics and medical device industry, and he
has significant experience in research and development functions via his prior professional experience. Mr.
Calafiore’s experience provides us with exceptional knowledge of the global orthopedics market (both
commercially and technically), particularly in the U.S., leaving us strongly positioned to accelerate our growth in
the region as he will take direct commercial responsibility over our commercial activities in the U.S.

We will also continue to benefit from the experience and industry knowledge of Emmanuel Bonhomme,
our Chief Commercial Officer (excluding the U.S., for whom Mr. Calafiore will manage commercial
responsibilities), and Michele Marin, our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Bonhomme, who served as our Interim
Chief Executive Officer between April 2022 and September 2022, has been a key member of our management
team since June 2018, and prior to his appointment as Interim Chief Executive Officer, served as the Company’s
President of EMEA where he was responsible for our largest geographic market. Prior to joining the Company,
Mr. Bonhomme spent more than 25 years in executive roles at leading pharmaceutical and medical device

Our management team has a strong track record of delivering on growth initiatives, including new
product development and customer acquisition, as well as maximizing the value of our product portfolio and
identifying new development opportunities. Our management team, with its strong and differentiated expertise
and broad international background, is well positioned to implement our international strategy.

As we continue to expand our geographic footprint and global operations, we may take advantage of
opportunities to further enhance and supplement our management talent, both from inside our organization as well
as with external candidates. We have made key investments into our human capital, specifically aiming to
strengthen our local management, sales force, medical education and R&D teams to ensure continued success in
accessing our markets as well as product innovation. We have made five key management hires since 2019 and
added over 300 customers in 2021 notwithstanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We further benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our
indirect shareholders, EQT and Loreda, an investment vehicle owned by Hansjörg Wyss (former owner of
Synthes, now DePuy Synthes, an orthopedics manufacturer which was acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2012),
who have supported us through the years, including via a capital injection of €20.0 million in June 2020, providing
precautionary support and financial flexibility during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more

**_ESG at the core of our value proposition, with tangible initiatives across multiple strategic dimensions_**

Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) is at the core of our values and strategy. Restoring
movement can fundamentally change a person’s life. That is why, in everything we do, we are passionately driven
by our desire to restore the “emotion of motion.” With that in mind, we and our management believe that ESG
matters should be at the core of our corporate strategy, specifically by: (i) obtaining top environmental
certifications and implementing climate-friendly policies; (ii) utilizing the highest standards of reporting and

transparency, in line with or even exceeding those of publicly-listed companies; and (iii) maintaining the utmost
responsibility and duty toward our employees’ well-being and society as a whole.

For example, we achieved an ISO 14000 certification for our Villanova plant in 2017 and for our Segesta
plant in Sicily in 2018, and we comply with the requirements stated by the AUA Permit (Unique Environmental
Permit according to Italian Law D.P.R 59/2013). Given the under-representation of women in our industry, we
are committed to increasing the number of females in our workforce. In 2021, 35.1% of our employees were
women. During the COVID-19 crisis, we implemented a variety of initiatives, including: (i) support to the Red
Cross through a donation that was used for the purchase of a blood drive vehicle; (ii) other donations for the
purchase of digital devices intended for COVID-19 patients to communicate with their families; and (iii) the
development and donation of transparent face shields to different hospitals (Belluno, Udine, Rimini, San Marino,
Tolmezzo, Padova, Piove di Sacco, San Camillo di Cremona, Clinica SoletSalus Rimini) as well as to “Mondo
Charge”—a non-profit organization dedicated to CHARGE syndrome—which allowed people with this rare
syndrome to be protected while still being able to communicate. Finally, our employees individually contributed
with donations to the Red Cross across different countries.

We have established, built and strengthened our ESG commitment by refining our corporate strategy,
setting targets and tracking key performance indicators. We use the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals (“SDGs”) to inspire sustainable behavior and have put in place ESG key performance indicators which
specifically track and assess performance in areas which contribute to the SDGs. See “Our Business—ESG—
_Environmental, Social and Governance.”_

**Product Portfolio**

**_Overview_**

We offer a broad and differentiated product portfolio with innovative implants for orthopedic joint
reconstruction and fixation based on state-of-the-art technology, including 3D printing. We believe that as a result
of our innovative and high-quality products as well as our ability to provide superior customer service, we have
built strong relationships with surgeons and hospitals. Our product range includes implants for total joint
replacements, whether for the first time (primary implants) or to replace an existing implant (“revisions”). As of
the date of this offering memorandum, we operate through four main product lines: (i) hip, (ii) extremities, (iii)
knees, and (iv) fixation and other devices. Additionally, through our ProMade brand, we provide custom-made
solutions for patients with complex orthopedic needs across most of our product lines.

Trabecular Titanium (“TT”) is one of our core technologies, which was developed on the basis of our
3D printing capabilities and which we use across product lines to manufacture certain implants. It offers the
scaffold for cell colonization and bone tissue vascularization. An optimal porosity and pore size promote enhanced
vascularization and mineralization, favoring new bone formation. Stem cells grown on TT scaffolds have shown
to adhere, proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts, even in the absence of osteogenic factors.
Histomorphometric analysis in a sheep model comparing TT with traditional coatings showed that TT favors
direct osteogenesis with high osseointegration. The following graphic sets forth key components of our innovative
product portfolio:

**_Extremities_**

Our extremities product line, which has a long-standing clinical track record, includes the first products
we historically developed. It covers today all sub-segments of shoulder joint replacements and, after our
acquisition of Discovery from Biomet in July 2015, also includes total elbow replacements. Our extremities
segment accounted for 37.8%, 38.7% and 39.7% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020
and 2021, respectively.

We believe our distinctive SMR system is a leading product globally, with more than 15 years of clinical
history. Our SMR system represents one of the first truly modular shoulder systems available in the market,
allowing for an easier revision as the patient’s pathology naturally progresses, from the surgeon’s point of view,
and less invasive surgery for the patient. The SMR design covers different pathologies encountered across a range
of procedures, including resurfacing (where only the head of the humerus is replaced), total anatomic shoulder,
reverse shoulder (where the shoulder geometry is reversed to improve the range of movement) or revisions.

We believe our focus on the shoulder and providing numerous options for surgeons to choose the optimal
implant for their patient position us and the SMR System among market leaders, in particular for the U.S., and in
a higher profitability segment, also as a result of the use of our TT technology.

Our key extremities products are described below:

The elbow replacement market is smaller than the shoulder market but one with the potential to expand
in the future, based on an ageing population and technological advancement. We expect elbow to be a source of
future growth and expect to be able to leverage on our existing relationships with shoulder surgeons.

With the launch of the new TEMA elbow system (currently expected for 2023), we will enter the U.S.
elbow market, which we believe is the most advanced for this type of surgery.

**_Knee_**

We have a broad knee product portfolio, covering both primary and revision total knee replacements in
cemented and cementless versions, including unicompartmental implants for the EU and Japan. Our knee product
line accounted for 18.5%, 17.4% and 18.7% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and
2021, respectively.

In 2015, we expanded our knee portfolio by launching the Physica system, a new total knee replacement
that we developed internally through the acquisition of patents and technology, together with a team of surgeons,
whose success has exceeded our expectations. To complement the Physica range and reach new surgeons, during
that same year we acquired the well-known product line ZUK from Zimmer for the European Economic Area,
Switzerland and Japan. The Physica system product range has continued to expand, including the Anatomic
Metaphyseal Fixation (“AMF”) TT cones (which are entirely 3D printed for complex primary and revision cases
and the first TT product we are aware for that has been cleared by the FDA for certain uses in knee) and Lima
Medial Congruent (“LMC”) liners as well as new Vitamin E liners to replace conventional polyethylene. The
former were designed specifically for the U.S. market together with U.S. surgeons to offer a more controlled
motion than a standard Cruciate Retaining (“CR”) knee driven through a stable medial compartment. We have
also received marketing authorization for our Physica Cementless Knee, which comprises a TT Tibial plate,
respectively certified and authorized in the EU and the U.S. and we have received FDA clearance for our Physica
High Posterior Stabilized (“HPS”) liners.

**_Hip_**

We offer a complete hip portfolio, including products for the higher-value revision market. We have a
differentiated hip portfolio tailored to both primary and revision joint replacement surgery, including a wide range
of stems, cups, acetabular liners and heads.

We focus in particular on cementless implants, which are mainly used in premium sub-segments for
primary as well as for revision although we have cemented options within our portfolio. The revision portfolio,
which is highly complementary to our ProMade solutions, allows for high prices due to the complexity of the
surgeries and products. Our focus on these sub-segments in the past years has sustained our growth. Our hip
product line accounted for 39.0%, 39.6% and 37.5% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020
and 2021, respectively.

_Stems_

Our hip stem portfolio includes a wide range of primary stems that covers each of the most common
surgical procedures, allowing the surgeon to choose between short stems and tissue sparing approaches or more
traditional design and surgical approaches.

**_Fixation and other_**

Our fixation and other segment comprises the distribution of products and devices such as intramedullary
nails, plates and screws that are mainly used for fixation in connection with bone fractures. This segment (fixation
and other) accounted for 4.7%, 4.2% and 4.1% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and
2021, respectively.

Differentiating our osteosynthesis systems from those on the market, we use polyether ether ketone
(“PEEK”) polymer, particularly used for the in the Diphos H Nail and Plate. PEEK Polymer is a significant
advancement in implants and, according to GIA, is one of the most effective alternatives to metal for implant
manufacturers, as it has almost the same elasticity as that of bone and is biocompatible, lightweight, strong,
chemically stable and radiolucent.

181

Our fixation product portfolio include Diphos Nail and Diphos H to treat fractures of the upper limb,
Supernail GT for fractures of the lower limb (as depicted in the graphic below). In addition, we carry screws and
staples for foot surgeries.

**Our Business Strategy**

We intend to strengthen our industry position and grow our business by focusing on innovative products,
sales approach and efficient operations. To achieve these goals, the key components of our business strategy are
as follows:

**_Pursue pioneering innovation in our differentiated product portfolio with exposure to high-growth and high_**
**_value-add segments including shoulder, revision and custom implants_**

We believe that demographic trends will support increased demand for our solutions over the long term
and that we have significant opportunities to grow our existing market share and expand to new markets by
continuing to introduce pioneering products and innovative technologies, consistently complementing our current
portfolio and creating synergies across product lines. We expect our multi-year pipeline to drive future growth.
We received 50 product authorizations and certifications in 2021. We intend to increase our exposure to
high-growth and high value-add market segments through continuous innovation in our product pipeline and
superior implant technologies. In order to remain at the forefront of technological advances, we intend to leverage
the experience of the approximately 140 professionals comprising our in-house R&D team. For example, our TT
technology is currently applied to approximately 12% (by revenue) of our product portfolio, and those products
typically result in higher overall margins than implants made with more traditional materials and manufacturing
processes. We intend to further integrate our TT technology across all segments of our implants in order to
maximize its potential and create new and superior quality implants, leveraging the fact that the price of implants
with TT products is approximately 30% higher than the price of the same implants without TT products. In
addition, we will continue to grow our high-margin extremities product line, aiming to expand from our current
offering of shoulder and elbow implants to ankle implants.

**_Continue expanding presence in profitable regions such as the U.S. and APAC while strengthening position_**
**_in core EU markets with tailored country and channel strategies_**

We intend to further accelerate our expansion in traditionally profitable markets such as the U.S. and
APAC and capture opportunities to increase our market share by implementing dedicated strategies across the
different countries. Our proven experience in finding and acquiring companies and products capable of generating
value, together with an organizational structure ready to make acquisitions, will allow us to carry out our
expansion strategy through targeted acquisitions capable of generating economies of scale. Our strategic
geographical focus is to further expand operations in the U.S. and APAC, while strengthening positions in core
EU markets and entering the Chinese market, with a focus on the growing shoulder segment.

In particular, our plan is to expand our established presence in the U.S., which we aim to make our largest
market through our (i) focus on sales pipeline development and sales force expansion; (ii) investment in local
teams and sales force competency; (iii) commercial excellence initiatives; and (iv) commitment to medical
education for surgeons and the medical community. We also aim to capture further market opportunities in the
U.S. by increasing ASC penetration through portfolio completion, among other specific initiatives.

Our geographic strategy will be supported by the expansion of our sales force, which varies according to
local market dynamics. For example, in the U.S., we have established direct sales that rely on a network of sales
agents and sub-agents. Our in-house sales force has proven to be a valuable resource in identifying and targeting
key opinion leaders, which remains part of our core commercial strategy.

In 2017, we introduced a market access team to further focus on regulatory, post-market surveillance and
clinical studies and now have structured regulatory and clinical research departments serviced by 36 professionals.

182


-----

We aim to add between 10 and 20 new non-stocking distributorships by 2025 to complement our direct sales
efforts in the United States.

**_Targeted investment approach with allocation of capital into high-value segments and regions_**

We operate a detailed management reporting system, which allows us to understand the true profitability
and return on investments for our different markets and product lines. We intend to further strengthen and expand
our existing international operations to attractive markets, such as the U.S., Australia, Japan, Italy, UK, Spain and
Germany from which we expect significant growth and where we have been investing and will continue to invest
in the coming years.

We expanded our U.S. team to accelerate our growth in the region. Our recently inaugurated ProMade
PoC Center in partnership with HSS further improves our access to the U.S. market. We intend to further penetrate
the U.S. market by expanding our existing product offering, which is currently focused on our higher-priced and
higher-margin shoulder implants complemented by hip and knee implants, while leveraging our cost base in a
market where orthopedic implants have historically sold at higher prices than in Europe. We also intend to
capitalize on trends such as new ASCs, which are increasingly common in the United States, to address the
demand for cost-efficient outpatient procedures for less complex, routine orthopedic procedures. Since ASCs
purchase orthopedic implants in bulk, the volume of their demand offers a unique opportunity to expand our
market share when considering high average selling prices in the U.S. market compared to Europe, even on a
discounted basis. We are setting-up an advisory board composed by surgeons and other ASC stakeholders to
understand specific ASC unmet needs and discuss future trends, with the aim of defining the best ASC strategy,
including the development of targeted products and services, including economically structured contracts targeted
to the ASCs. To solidify our technological and reputational standing in the U.S., we will continue to seek out and
develop strategic partnerships with hospitals and research institutions similar to the ones we have established with
HSS in New York City, the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, the Upstate Orthopedics in Syracuse,
New York, the Rothman Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the Western Orthopedics in Denver,
Colorado.

Beyond expenditures aimed at further expansion in high-value regions, we have made significant
investments in our products and facilities to support the medium-term plan of increased production capacity.
Accordingly, we had Growth Capital Expenditures (i.e., discretionary expenditures) and Maintenance Capital
Expenditures amounting to €29.6 million and €7.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021
and amounting to €29.2 million and €8.5 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.
We expect that our 2023 Capital Expenditures will be in line with our historical Capital Expenditures.

Additionally, part of our targeted investment approach is accelerating growth and increasing handling
efficiency through management of instrument sets. Our total Capital Expenditures in instruments sets were €14.9
million, €17.4 million and €15.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively,
which reflects continued investment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that these investments position
us to benefit from the short-term rebound in procedures due to clearing of the backlog from deferred surgeries
during the COVID-19 related shutdowns, which we estimate at over €60.0 million of sales for our business over
the medium-term. Going forward, we believe we will also be able to further optimize our cash flows used in our
Capital Expenditures, as (i) we are subject to relatively limited Maintenance Capital Expenditures and (ii) we are
able to adapt Growth Capital Expenditures, which are inherently discretionary (for example, expenditures on new
instrument sets and manufacturing facility expansions), to market conditions.

**_Leverage our advanced manufacturing expertise as first-mover in 3D printing with proprietary TT technology_**
**_and ProMade PoC Center in partnership with HSS_**

Our advanced manufacturing expertise is well-established, as we were among the first to use 3D printing
in orthopedics and have extensively developed our proprietary TT technology, which is supported by over 14
years of clinical data and more than 182,000 implants worldwide to date. We have also founded the ProMade PoC
Center together with HSS, one of the leading orthopedic hospitals in the U.S., ranked by U.S. News as the leader
in the U.S. for orthopedics for 12 consecutive years and top-ranked in orthopedics and rheumatology for 30
consecutive years. We believe that the ProMade PoC Center is the first design and 3D printing facility for custom
complex implants in a hospital setting. It leverages the combination of our advanced technology and experience
and HSS’ expertise in clinical care and biomechanical engineering, all at the point of care. The facility was
inaugurated and became operational in March 2021. The partnership increases the availability and speed of
personalized orthopedic care for patients with complex reconstruction cases in the U.S., reducing the time required

183


-----

during the design and production phase. We believe that our advanced manufacturing expertise and proven track
record of product innovation, combined with strategic partnerships, will create avenues for future growth.

We anticipate that future growth in our revenues from ProMade will be driven by multiple factors. The
market for 3D printed implants is projected to grow at approximately 8% to 12% CAGR between 2019 and 2025
(according to industry and market data elaborated in September 2021 by a global management consulting
company). We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the space created as big players shift their
focus away from custom implants due to challenges with low volumes. Our partnership with HSS also allows us
to have a stronger foothold in the U.S. market. Further, we are in the process of obtaining a 510(k) clearance from
the FDA for custom-made glenoids that if cleared, could accelerate the use of our custom-made solutions by U.S.
customers. We also expect higher cost efficiency through automation, with a positive impact on profitability for
ProMade products. Further, we aim to roll-out the HSS concept to other orthopedic centers of excellence and
markets.

The high quality of our processes and custom-made products is attested by the EU Quality Management
System Certificate under the EU Medical Devices Regulation for Class III Custom-Made devices which we
received in May 2020. We are the first Italian company to receive this certification. In addition, from February
2021, we started to provide Class III Custom-Made devices in compliance with the new Medical Device
Regulation for Europe and passed our first EU Medical Devices Regulation audit in May 2021.

**Technology and Innovation**

We are at the forefront of technological advancements in orthopedics through our innovative orthopedics
portfolio (being a first mover in 3D printing and proprietary TT technology) and delivery of best-in-class patient
care (also through the ProMade PoC Center with HSS, which we believe is the world’s first point of care design
and 3D printing site for custom solutions within a hospital, at the point of care).

**_3D Printing_**

We are a pioneer in 3D printing (also known
as “additive manufacturing”) in the orthopedic implant
industry and are one of the world’s largest users, in
biomedical sector, of Electron Beam Melting (“EBM”)
machines in our manufacturing process. Our 3D
printing process technology, which has no design
boundaries, provides great benefits for the entire
production value chain. Due to its highly efficient
material utilization resulting in minimal waste material,
the 3D printing technology is an energy-efficient and
environmentally friendly manufacturing process. We
manufacture our prosthetic components in TT with the
EBM technology, using a high-energy focused electron
beam to locally melt metallic powders layer upon layer.
Due to its extremely high flexibility, EBM allows the creation of components of complex shapes involving either
dense or porous parts, which results in the great versatility of TT products. Compared to laser melting, EBM takes
place in a vacuum and at high temperatures to ensure excellent mechanical properties and the absence of residual
stress.

**_Trabecular Titanium (TT)_**

Our dedication to R&D has produced
successful and consistent results and we are at the
forefront of 3D printing with our advanced TT
technology, which we have developed in-house and
enhanced for over 14 years, building on over 40 years
of experience in titanium processing for medical
purposes. TT is made entirely of Titanium alloy and
commercial-grade titanium and has a
three-dimensional, multiplanar, regular, hexagonal
cell structure. Compared to traditional technologies,
we believe that TT offers greater adhesion to the
substrate since the porous structure is composed of a
single piece, thus reducing the risk of delamination
and possible galvanic effects and guaranteeing greater
durability, superior osteoconductive and
osteoinductive capacity for better osseointegration of components. Pre-clinical testing for TT implants have
shown enhanced cell migration and vascularization, improved transportation of oxygen, nutrients, ions and bone
inducing factors, which favor the formation of new bone tissue around the prosthesis. TT is one of our most
advanced technologies, with no limitation on shape in the design phase, and we intend to continue to leverage it
to further diversify our product portfolio and create cutting-edge new implants.

**_ProMade: Custom-made Solutions and Service offering_**

In addition to our off-the-shelf product lines, we offer custom-made solutions through our ProMade
service. ProMade was established as a brand in 2015 and as a dedicated service in 2018, drawing upon over 14
years of experience in developing 3D printed custom-made solutions for complex orthopedic reconstructions.

ProMade quality is based on our design heritage and long clinical track record in building high-quality
implants. We were an early adopter of 3D printing with EBM printer development and use of titanium parts (with
over 182,000 3D printed implants worldwide over 14 years). Further, our proprietary manufacturing, cleaning and
inspection techniques have been developed to provide the same confidence in the quality of ProMade implants as
customers have come to expect over the 75 years of our history.

ProMade is a design service that partners with
surgeons to develop a variety of bespoke outputs,
including 3D printed implants and instruments,
surgical plans and anatomical models. With ProMade
we take a highly collaborative approach, aiming to
partner surgeons with the same design engineer to fully
project manage all of their cases, allowing a high level
of mutual familiarity of clinical and communication
preferences and design capability. This collaborative
approach is highly valued by surgeons, as not only do
they obtain a patient-specific solution but one that is
also tailored to the surgeon’s needs.

ProMade solutions are designed with the intention (i)
to give surgeons immediate confidence in the
product’s performance, by providing primary implant
stability _in situ, (ii) to have implants which transfer_
loads in biomechanically effective way and (iii) to
provide clinicians with the option to execute a complete biomechanically assessed surgical plan with standard
components compatible with the custom designed and produced components. This design philosophy adopted is
made possible by our unique technological enablers. Trabecular Titanium demonstrates high friction with bone
for primary stability, as well as clinically proven long term osseointegration. Our deep experience in design and
3D printing allows for the production of complex designs which fill and load bony defects, as opposed to relying
on rim fit or peripheral bone screws as anchor points, often seen in traditional custom designs. Finally, the
expanded modularity offered by compatibility with our standard line products, allows for surgeons to perform the

185


-----

entire joint replacement by combining the bespoke 3D printed component, with cost-effective standard line
components, based upon a ProMade engineer’s biomechanically assessed pre-operative plan.

ProMade solutions are normally required in severe cases like tumor patients, revision and especially in
re-revision operations since the removal of primary and revision implants typically causes bone and tissue
damage, thus demanding more sophisticated and complex implants. While developing customized implants and
instrument sets requires advanced R&D capability, it also contributes to our product portfolio mix. In addition,
our customized ProMade solutions enable us to establish new, and strengthen existing, relationships with
surgeons, who, we believe, value the highly specialized solutions that our ProMade products provide for their
complex orthopedic cases, creating pull through for our other standard products lines.

The new ProMade PoC Center, which became operational in March 2021, is operated by us on the HSS
main campus in New York City. We believe it is the first point of care based design and 3D printing facility for
complex custom implants. The partnership is a six-year collaboration with an option for a two-year extension.
The ProMade PoC Center has increased our service capability to the U.S. market by proximity and improved our
regulatory access in the U.S. market.

On January 4, 2019, as part of our collaboration with HSS in New York, we, Lima USA and HSS entered
into a series of agreements to govern the establishment of a commercial collaboration for the development and
production of customized orthopedic implants at a facility operated by Lima USA on the HSS campus, as well as
HSS’ investment in Emil Newco S.à r.l.. In particular, Lima USA and the HSS will collaborate to improve
musculoskeletal care and products.

The key features of our ProMade service include:

    - _Dedicated design engineer: We endeavor to partner surgeons with the same engineer to fully project_
manage all their cases, allowing a highly personal approach and a service tailored to the customer’s
needs. This partnership is highly valued by surgeons, who frequently consider the ProMade design
engineer to be an extension of their clinical team.

    - _Wide spectrum offering: We can provide a wide spectrum of custom solutions, ranging from_
modifications of standard implants, to highly complex implants to compensate for significant bone
loss/deformities in revision cases, implants designed with pre-determined resection plans for
tumor/limb salvage cases and novel implants for dysplasia/osteotomy corrections.

    - _Patient Specific Instruments (“PSIs”) and Models:_ We offer a comprehensive set of 3D printed
resection guides, PSI’s and trial implants for each surgery, to aid the surgeon in executing each step
of the bespoke surgical plan.

    - _Bespoke surgical plans: We provide a fully comprehensive surgical plan with each solution,_
provided digitally for 3D image manipulation, printed in A4 for pre-procedure reading, and A2 to
mount on the OR wall for quick reference during surgery.

    - _Fully sterile offering: The majority of our custom solutions and surgical guides/PSIs are provided_
sterile, providing reassurance to surgeons that they have reduced the possibility of introducing an
infection into the surgical site.

    - _Combination with on-the-shelf products: Our standard approach is to develop custom-made_
solutions that can be easily combined with existing products in our portfolio. Additionally, we are
able to design interfaces which allow connectivity with competitor implants where competitors
provide the required permissions to access technical documentation.

    - _Titanium craftsmanship: We use our design experience, 3D printing and our TT technology to work_
with titanium and create complex design features to ensure the perfect fit.

    - _Surgeon specific custom instruments: We also offer the possibility to customize our standard_
instruments, or produce a single special request instrument for individual surgeons to use in their
standard practice for their routine cases.

    - _Web portal: In July 2021, we launched a new web-based portal to manage end-to-end_
communications and data transfer between the surgeon, our engineer and other stakeholders in the

186


-----

customer solution development process, such as sales representatives and sales managers. The portal
can be accessed via PC browser or mobile app and allows surgeons to engage with their ProMade
engineer and review and approve documents at their convenience.

**_Smart SPACE: digitally-assisted surgery platform_**

Smart SPACE is a new digital environment, created with the goal of empowering stakeholders with
technology, by combining human nature with digital speed. Its aim is to empower patient care stakeholders to
allow them to make informed, data driven decisions in the care of patients, but to do so in an efficient and
sustainable way in order to meet the needs of modern health care systems.

The main products in the Smart SPACE ecosystem are the Virtual 3D planner, 3D Positioners and the
assisted reality (aR) Guidance system, being made available for Primary Shoulder Arthroplasty.

The 3D Virtual Planner is a digital planning software application, which utilizes proprietary machine
learning algorithms that allow for powerful auto-segmentation of imaging data to very quickly generate a 3D
model of the patient’s anatomy and surgical plans (and to easily select the most appropriate implant configuration
from our highly modular implant portfolio) on the surgeons own PC, without the need for company engineering
input. Additionally, the on-machine instrument creation tool, allows the surgeon to auto-design a 3D Positioner
(PSI) and order easily with the click of one button by connecting with engineers and operations via the cloud
portal.

The 3D Virtual Planner will include some unique features such as the inner cortical segmentation as well
as the indication of bone quality derived from a CT scan. We also plan to provide surgeons with predictive
analytics driven by data acquired by means of post-operative individual patient outcomes captured through inertial
sensors to support them in the decision making during the planning phase. Additionally, we will provide advance
range of motion simulations, based on real patient motion analysis and kinematics biomechanical models.

187


-----

The assisted reality (aR) Guidance system, comprised of Position Tracking System (PTS), System
Control Software (SCS) and assisted reality (aR) headset, aims to allow the surgeon to accurately execute the
generated plan, by providing real time surgical feedback of instrument and implant positioning.

Digital solutions are the new frontier of orthopedic surgery, with the arrival of surgical guidance systems
and robots, which are used in combination with implants and expected to assist surgeons during surgery and are
often used as tools to market implants for companies. In certain countries, surgeons also use digital technologies
to market their practice.

**Quality Control and Quality Assurance**

Product quality and reliability are very important for maintaining our reputation for excellence in the
orthopedic devices industry. We believe that product quality, superior service, qualified employees and process
efficiency are all critical for a successful quality control process. For these reasons, we have implemented a
stringent protocol throughout each stage of our production which provides for 100% testing of our orthopedic
products and gives us the ability to trace the history of inspections of each product sold. These quality control
measures have allowed us to ensure strong client satisfaction and reduce production risks.

We seek to ensure that our quality control systems fulfill the requirements of internationally
acknowledged standards as well as country-specific regulations to ensure that we are fully compliant with the
healthcare requirements of each jurisdiction where we operate. As a result of our attention to quality, we have
been able to certify our quality system according to the ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 standards and the MDSAP
(Medical Device Single Audit Program) that combines the requirements of the U.S., Brazil, Japan, Australia, and
Canada. We are also routinely audited by multiple EU notified bodies for certification compliance.

**Compliance**

Our compliance system sets out general principles and guidelines for fair, legal and appropriate conduct
in the context of business transactions, focusing on, among other topics, anti-corruption, donations and
sponsoring, government procurement and conflicts of interest. Additionally, we have adopted an organizational,
management and control model (the “OMC”) pursuant to and in compliance with Italian Legislative Decree
231/2001, as well as an ethics code applicable to domestic activities and, to the extent possible, international
activities. Our ethics code contains the behavioral principles and basic ethical values which we aspire to in the
pursuit of our objectives. Our risk and control system, including the OMC and our ethics code, is dynamic and
we review it on a periodic basis in order to implement new developments and best practices in risk control systems.
To ensure the implementation of our compliance system, we have conducted face-to-face and web-based trainings,
including at the top management level, and our compliance officers are required to participate in periodic training
courses. Further, we have compliance procedures in place for what we deem to be high risk payments to third
parties.

Our employees have the option to report violations to our compliance organization and follow up on any
indication or allegation of violations. We continuously monitor, evaluate and endeavor to improve our compliance
system.

**IT Infrastructure**

Our IT systems are closely integrated to improve overall business efficiency and transparency between
locations. We have worked to standardize and streamline our IT infrastructure to monitor the efficiency rates of
our production, characterized by a high degree of automation. We have implemented detailed plans for the
restoration of critical IT processes and operations in the event of a system disruption. In addition to designing an
architecture that is designed to prevent, detect, and isolate security breaches, the resiliency of the network is based
upon automatic re-routing of traffic in the event of a circuit failure. All server rooms are backed up by
uninterruptible power supply in combination with a diesel generator set. In addition, we carry out on an annual
basis audits of our cybersecurity infrastructures with AON, following which measures are implemented to
improve security.

Our information technology department centrally manages global IT environment from our headquarters.
Our infrastructure is a solid mix between on premise and cloud solutions. On premise data center provisioning
mission critical application is located on a tier III certified facility nearby Milan while our secondary data center
is located at our headquarters. A disaster recovery plan is in place and maintained to guarantee a full replication
of mission critical applications. Internet connection continuity is granted by a redundancy of providers and
technologies. Both data centers have UPS and diesel generators ensuring continuity of service during power
outages. The cloud environment includes a variety of solutions provided by best in class companies. Each
subsidiary is directly connected with our headquarters via secured site-to-site VPN and every user belongs to one
and one only domain.

We have a continuous focus on cyber security, having adopted the latest technologies and updated
procedures to protect our IT environment. We periodically perform assessments and penetration tests to verify
effectiveness of our solutions and update our strategy, which is overseen by our Data Protection Officer, to ensure
compliance with the GDPR, HIPAA and other international regulations. We and all of our core IT suppliers have
a cyber-insurance policy covering related risks.

This back-end infrastructure allows us to provide our internal and external customers with latest solutions
to perform their duties in an efficient and digital space. We manage our core processes having both our
headquarters and every subsidiary in the same integrated instance.

**Employees**

**Total ......................................................................................................................** **997** **1,023** **1,022**

We have a strong and experienced management team with extensive industry experience and network.
In the last three years we strengthened our management team with several new members with solid track records
and international backgrounds, such as our new CEO, and with internal promotions. In recent years we also
expanded our workforce.

In certain countries in which we operate, including Italy, we are subject to collective bargaining
agreements negotiated between unions and employers’ representatives at the national or sectorial level and made
mandatory pursuant to national labor laws. We believe that we have positive relations with our employees and the
applicable unions and work councils. As of December 31, 2021, the percentage of our employees covered by a
collective bargaining agreement stood at approximately 60%; during fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, the number
of strike hours affecting the Group in Italy did not exceed 0.39% of the total hours worked in total.

Even during COVID-19 outbreak, we never closed our manufacturing sites and we continued to invest
in order to be ready to benefit from the short-term rebound in procedures. We regularly meet with the unions and
work councils on an annual basis to update them on the direction of the business and to address any concerns that
they may have. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain employees. We historically
experienced a strong employee retention rate with a limited turnover. Our internal policies focus on diversity,
non-discrimination and merit.

We invest a significant amount of time and expense in training our employees and, in particular, our
sales associates on how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses.

**Legal proceedings**

We are from time to time party to various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
our business, including claims and legal proceedings regarding improper delivery of goods and services, product
liability, product defects, intellectual property infringement, termination of business relationships and/or alleged
or suspected violations of applicable laws in various jurisdictions. We cannot rule out that some of these claims
or proceedings could result in rulings against us, but we are defending, and will defend, ourselves in these claims
and proceedings to the extent necessary and prudent. For example, we are currently in dialogue with the
Therapeutic Goods Administration (the “TGA”) in Australia’s Department of Health and Aged Care in relation
to an elevated revision rate in Australia pertaining to certain constructs within our SMR shoulder platform, which
may impact the registration status and continuance of these products/the SMR in the Australian market. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment—If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we_
_may be required to suspend production or institute a recall of our products or be subject to other enforcement_
_actions.” In line with the approach of other medical device companies, we have also challenged the_
constitutionality (among other items) of Decree 216/2022 and intend to challenge Decree 251/2022, which relate
to the Payback Mechanism in Italy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business—We
_derive a substantial portion of our business from the award of public contracts, which requires frequent_
_participation in competitive, highly regulated public tender offer processes, often limit our ability to negotiate_
_pricing and other terms and make us subject to changes in public spending policies.” We have not otherwise been_
within the past twelve months from the date hereof, and we are not currently, a party to any governmental, legal,
administrative, arbitration or dispute proceedings either individually or in the aggregate, that have had, or are
expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial position or profitability, nor so far as we are aware,
are any such proceedings pending or threatened. As of December 31, 2021, we set up provisions for risks and
charges equal to €3.9 million in our financial statements, in order to cover liabilities that may arise from any
administrative, legal or arbitration proceedings.

190


-----

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance against various risks associated with our business, including product liability,
employer’s liability, plant and equipment insurance and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.

We believe that our existing insurance policies are adequate in terms of both amounts covered and
conditions of coverage to cover the major risks of our business, taking into account the cost of insurance coverage
and the potential risks to business operations. Our insurance coverage is regularly evaluated and adjusted as
necessary. We cannot rule out, however, that we could suffer damages in the future that are not covered by our
insurance policies or that exceed the coverage limits set in these policies. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_Our Industry and Business—We may not be able to secure and maintain adequate levels of product liability_
_insurance coverage on acceptable terms, or at all.” Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will also be able_
to obtain adequate insurance coverage at appropriate conditions in the future.

**Intellectual Property**

Intellectual property, which includes patents, utility models, designs, copyrights and trademarks, is
important to our business and in the orthopedic industry overall. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how,
continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
However, due to our wide product range, we do not believe our business is dependent on any single patent, license
or new manufacturing process. Our standard practice is to seek patent protection for the intellectual property
technical solutions relevant to our business, including our TT technology. We also protect our proprietary rights
through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with
vendors, employees and others who may have access to proprietary information.

As of September 30, 2022, we owned 157 patents and 155 pending applications for patents throughout
the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products. These include 8 patents
and 7 pending applications currently owned by Dr. Mahfouz, founder of TechMah, that will be assigned to us
according to contractual agreements. The table below sets out the number of patents and pending patent
applications that we own by product area.

From time to time, we are involved in intellectual property litigation. Although we have been successful
in enforcing and defending our intellectual property in the past, third parties may bring claims of infringement of
their intellectual property rights against us or challenge the validity of our intellectual property and we might
decide to bring new claims of patent infringement against third parties or challenge the validity of their intellectual
property. These proceedings could be costly to bring or defend and could result in our being restricted from using
certain technologies, paying damages for previous use of third party intellectual property, third parties being
permitted to use our technologies or our patent protection for our technologies being lost. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Intellectual Property—Litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual_
_property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money to defend ourselves and could prevent_
_us from selling our implant systems.”_

**ESG – Environmental, Social and Governance**

Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) is at the core of our values and strategy. Restoring
movement can be one of the greatest joys in a person’s life. That is why, in everything we do, we are passionately
driven by our desire to restore the “emotion of motion.” Our implants can fundamentally change a person’s life.
With that in mind, we work tirelessly with those closest to us in mind, knowing that the more we innovate and
progress, the more we can help people to live long, healthy, and carefree lives.

191


-----

We and our management believe that ESG matters should be at the core of our corporate strategy,
specifically by: (i) obtaining top environmental certifications and implementing climate-friendly policies; (ii)
utilizing the highest standards of reporting and transparency, in line with or even exceeding those of publicly-listed
companies; and (iii) maintaining the utmost responsibility and duty toward our employees’ well-being and society
as a whole.

ESG is a long-term commitment, and we have established, built and strengthened our ESG commitment
by refining our strategy, setting targets and tracking key performance indicators. We use the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (“SDG”) to inspire sustainable behavior and have put in place ESG key
performance indicators which specifically track and assess performance in areas which contribute to SDGs. In
particular, we have been addressing goals relating to health and wellbeing, gender equality, clean water and
sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure,
responsible consumption and production, climate action and peace, justice and strong institutions.

**_Environment_**

We comply with the highest standards relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and
health of our personnel and the public. These requirements relate to a broad range of our activities, including (i)
product and industrial related environmental protection, and (ii) operational management of occupational safety
and well-being related to hazardous substances in production activities.

We obtained and maintain a number of environmental certifications and we support climate-friendly
policies. In particular, we achieved the ISO 14000 certification for the Villanova plant in 2017 and for the Segesta
plant in Sicily in 2018 and we comply with the requirements stated by the AUA Permit (Unique Environmental
Permit according to Italian Law D.P.R 59/2013).

**Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: We adopt strict controls on our greenhouse gas emissions,**

on our water usage as well as well as promoting a zero waste to landfill culture. We introduced car sharing policies
for employees aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and we implement measures to reduce the environmental impact
of our business, including by not releasing harmful emissions into the air, water or soil and only using raw
materials that are produced in Europe from certified suppliers. Finally, our new power plant is powered in part by
solar panels and we measure the solar electric power production per year.

**_Social Responsibility_**

We are committed to our responsibility and duty towards our employees’ wellbeing and society as a
whole.

**Diversity and inclusion: We promote diversity and inclusion through our recruiting process as well as**
providing ongoing training and education programs to our employees. In addition, we have adopted diversity and
non-discrimination policies. Given the under-representation of women in our industry, we are committed to
increasing the number of females in our workforce. As of December 31, 2021, 35.1% of our employees and were
women.

**Employee engagement: We periodically assess employee engagement through dedicated initiatives as**
well as monitor key performance indicators, including the employee turnover.

**Health and safety: We are focused on the safety of our employees and measure several accident-related**
key performance indicators such as the number of accidents over 3 days. We have crisis management procedures
in place, which led us to promptly set-up a specific crisis management committee to deal with the COVID-19
situation. Ensuring our employees have a proper work-life balance is an important objective for us. To this end,
in 2018 we introduced a smart working policy along with the necessary tools and trainings to ensure our employees
could take advantage of this flexible work organization. This proved very useful during the COVID-19 crisis
when we decided to significantly extend smart working to safeguard the health of our employees.

**Philanthropy: We also demonstrate our support to society through donations. As an example, during**
the COVID-19 crisis, we implemented a variety of initiatives including support to the Red Cross through a
donation that was used for the purchase of a blood drive vehicle and other donations for the purchase of digital
devices intended for COVID-19 patients to communicate with their families, the development and donation of
transparent face shields to different hospitals (Belluno, Udine, Rimini, San Marino, Tolmezzo, Padova, Piove di
Sacco, San Camillo di Cremona, Clinica SoletSalus Rimini) as well as to “Mondo Charge” – a non-profit
organization dedicated to CHARGE syndrome – which allowed people with this rare syndrome to be protected

while still being able to communicate. Finally, employees individually contributed with donations to the Red
Cross across different countries.

**_Corporate Compliance and Governance_**

We are committed to conducting our business in a fair and transparent manner according to the highest
ethical stands and in compliance with the law. We have adopted Assobiomedica Compliance principles and apply
them throughout the entire Organization, when applicable. In countries where Assobiomedica Compliance
Policies are not applicable, we apply local standards.

**Training: We have adopted a code of ethics as well as a whistle blowing policy on which employees at**
all levels have been trained. 74.7% of employees have completed our anti-corruption training as of July 2022.

**Accountability: We seek to comply with the standards of ESG reporting and transparency. We have**
quarterly reporting in place to our board of directors, rating agencies and lenders. Our by-laws require us to comply
with the gender quota requirements. We also have a sustainability champion on the board and a number of
corporate approval policies among which those for operational expenses, capital expenses and travel.

**LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND CERTAIN REGULATORY REGIMES**

**Regulatory Environment**

**_Legal provisions applicable to industrial and commercial undertakings_**

The Group is subject to the regulatory framework generally applicable to industrial and commercial
undertakings in force in the various countries in which it operates. The regulatory framework in the areas of
intellectual property and product safety is particularly important with regard to the Group’s business.

The Group may also be subject to the Italian Golden Power Legislation, pursuant to which the Italian
Government can, inter alia, prohibit or impose restrictions and conditions on (i) the acquisition of shareholdings
in companies having assets and relationships in sectors qualified as strategic (e.g., defense and national security,
energy, transport, communications, healthcare, _etc.), and (ii) resolutions, acts or transactions approved by_
companies holding assets and relationships in strategic sectors and resulting in a change in ownership, control or
possession of such assets or relationships, including the enforcement of securities over the shares/assets, or in the
use or purpose thereof.

In particular, acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the European
Union (including Italian) and acquisitions of interests by persons or entities not belonging to the European Union
that entail the acquisition of at least 10% of the voting rights or share capital (provided that the value of
investments is equal to at least €1 million) must be reported to the Office of the President of the Council of
Ministers for the possible exercise of the veto right or the application of conditions; acquisitions that exceed the
15%, 20%, 25% and 50% of the voting rights or share capital thresholds are also subject to the reporting obligation.
Starting from January 1, 2023, acquisitions of controlling interests by individuals or entities belonging to the
European Union are subject to the Italian Golden Power Legislation only if related to companies holding operating
in the defense and national security, communications energy, transport, healthcare, agri-food and financial
sectors. In the defense and national security sector, the relevant threshold is more than 3% of the voting rights or
share capital for both European Union and non-European Union investors. Resolutions, acts or transactions
approved by a company holding assets and relationships in strategic sectors that give rise to changes in the
ownership, control or possession of such assets, including the enforcement of securities over the shares / assets,
or in the use or purpose thereof must also be reported within ten days, and in any case prior to their implementation,
to the Office of the President of the Council of Ministers.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Company’s management is of the view that it operates
its business substantially in compliance with the regulatory framework described below. In addition, during the
financial years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and as of the date of this offering memorandum,
there were no situations involving changes in and/or violations of regulatory provisions applicable to the Issuer
and its business that have led to costs for the adjustment of its production sites and/or the characteristics of its
products, in terms of the business strategy or geographical allocation of the Group’s production sites.

**_Regulatory framework for the manufacture and marketing of the Group’s products_**

The clinical trials or investigations, marketing and launch of the medical devices and orthopedic implants
produced by the Issuer and the Group (the “Devices”) are governed by domestic and international regulatory
provisions and subject to regulatory oversight and control by regulatory agencies and government entities
including the Ministry of Health in Italy and the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).

Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory framework may give rise to, _inter alia, delays in_
obtaining access to the market or marketing restrictions, product recalls, product seizures, interruptions in
production, operating restrictions, suspension or revocation of access to the market for the products, injunctions,
and administrative or criminal sanctions/fines.

Such regulatory framework is subject to continuous updates that could impose more stringent
requirements and, more generally, there would appear to be a worldwide trend toward an increasingly stringent
regulatory framework.

194


-----

_European Union_

The European Union (“EU”) has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design,
manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical
devices.

Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the “EU Medical
**Devices Directive”), which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the “EU** **Medical**
**Devices Regulation”). Our current certificates have been granted under the EU Medical Devices Directive whose**
regime is described below. However, starting on May 26, 2021, some of the EU Medical Devices Regulation
requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive with regard
to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance and vigilance requirements.
Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new
regime set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation when our current certificates expire and until May 26,
2025 at the latest. To date, our only medical devices placed on the market in compliance with the EU Medical
Devices Regulation are class III implantable custom-made medical devices (ProMade devices).

_Medical Devices Directive_

Under the EU Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet
the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, including the
requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise
the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. Any risks which may be
associated with their use must constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and
must be compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety. In addition, the device must achieve the
performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a manner suitable for
its functions as specified by the manufacturer. The European Commission has adopted various standards
applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and
safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also
harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards
is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable
presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.

To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical
Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies
according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity
of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things,
on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions
of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during
normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and
acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the
performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices
(Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products
with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity
assessment procedure requires the involvement of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations
designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified
body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system (the
notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards – which is
ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems – conform to these requirements). If satisfied
that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of
conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may
then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.

Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to announced
periodic and (additionally) unannounced surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable
requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant
certificate(s).

_Medical Devices Regulation_

The regulatory landscape related to medical devices in the EU recently evolved. On April 5, 2017, the
EU Medical Devices Regulation was adopted with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and
patient safety. The EU Medical Devices Regulation establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable
regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensures a high level of safety and health while
supporting innovation. Unlike the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Medical Devices Regulation is directly
applicable in all EU member states without the need for implementation into national law. This aims at increasing
harmonization across the EU. Supplementary domestic regulation and delegated legal acts of the European
Commission may further substantiate requirements applicable to the Group. Even though not legally binding, the
Medical Device Coordination Group issues guidance to interpretation of the EU Medical Devices Regulation.

The EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective on May 26, 2021. Devices lawfully placed on the
market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made
available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional
provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid and there must not be significant
changes in the device’s design and intended purpose. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply
with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation, in particular
the obligations described below.

As with the previous framework, medical devices require an EU CE mark to be imported, sold or
distributed within the EU. For this purpose, medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment based on a
system of risk classification of the medical devices and, depending on the risk class of the device, with the
involvement of a notified body. Also under the EU Medical Devices Regulation, the Group is subject to announced
and unannounced surveillance audits by the notified bodies.

The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made
device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and
importers) must register by submitting identification information to an electronic system (“Eudamed”), unless
they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives)
also includes the name, address and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance.
The new Regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market,
manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique
device identifier (“UDI”) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability
of the devices. Each device – and as applicable, each package – will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device
identifier (“UDI-DI”), specific to a device, and a production identifier (“UDI-PI”) to identify the unit producing
the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on Eudamed, which
includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in Eudamed will become
applicable at a later date (as Eudamed is not yet fully functional). Until Eudamed is fully functional, the
corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the
obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular,
information regarding vigilance reporting, clinical investigations, registration of devices and economic operators,
and certificate notifications.

All manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical
device vigilance system which has been reinforced by the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Under this system,
serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”) must be reported to the relevant authorities of
the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through Eudamed – once functional – and aim to
ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors such as the
economic operators in the supply chain will also be informed. Until Eudamed is fully functional, the
corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply. A serious incident is defined as
any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device made available on the market,
including use-error due to ergonomic features, as well as any inadequacy in the information supplied by the
manufacturer and any undesirable side-effect, which, directly or indirectly, might have led or might lead to the
death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a temporary or permanent serious deterioration of a patient's,
user's or other person's state of health or a serious public health threat. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs
defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident
associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. An FSCA may include the recall,
modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the
manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety
Notices. For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause

196


-----

has been identified or a FSCA implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented,
manufacturers may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports.

The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU
legislation. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed
and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning
misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not
specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for
example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are
defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices,
which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general
public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.

Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices
in connection with medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations.
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to
healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which
impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the
United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial
compliance programs.

The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) which
consists of the 27 EU Member States plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.

_Brexit_

Following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the United Kingdom
(the “UK”), the UK formally withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit”, and,
following the expiry of the Brexit transitional period on December 31, 2020, the UK now operates under a distinct
regulatory regime and certain EU laws now only apply to the UK in respect of Northern Ireland (as laid out in the
Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland). The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or
MHRA, is now the UK’s standalone regulator. Although the UK and EU have now reached an agreement on its
future trading relationship (implemented in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement from January 1, 2021,
or the “TCA”), the agreement does not cover all regulatory areas regarding medical devices, which may be subject
to future bilateral discussions going forward and could further change the relationship between the UK and the
EU in this regard.

EU laws which were directly applicable before the end of the transitional period or have been. transposed
into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law.” However, new
legislation such as the EU Medical Devices Regulation will not be applicable. The UK government has introduced
a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act which seeks to address regulatory gaps through implementing
regulations and delegated powers covering the fields of human medicines, clinical studies of human medicines,
and medical devices.

Significantly, under the TCA there is no mutual recognition of regulatory regimes and certifications
between the EU and the UK. CE marks issued by EU-based notified bodies will continue to be recognized by the
UK until June 30, 2023, but from July 1, 2023, new devices placed on the Great Britain market will need to
conform with the new UK Conformity Assessment (“UKCA”) marking requirements. Since January 1, 2021,
medical devices placed on the market in the UK must be registered with the MHRA, following a grace period
ranging from four to 12 months. Manufacturers based outside the UK will also need to appoint a UK Responsible
Person (which may be an individual or a corporate entity). Only a manufacturer established in the UK or a UK
Responsible Person will be able to place a device on the market in Great Britain. Under the terms of the Protocol
on Ireland and Northern Ireland, products placed on the market in Northern Ireland will continue to be subject to
the EU regulatory regime. A public consultation by the MHRA was opened until end of November 2021 on the
post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. The consultation proposes amendments to
the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (which are based on EU legislation, primarily the Medical Devices
Directive), in particular to create a new access pathways to support innovation, create an innovative framework
for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform in vitro diagnostic regulation, and
foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. The consultation indicated that the
MHRA will publish guidance in relation to the changes to the regulatory framework and may rely more heavily
on guidance to add flexibility to the regime. On June 26, 2022, the MHRA published its long-awaited response to

197


-----

its consultation on the UK’s post-Brexit regulatory regime for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical
devices. The MHRA confirmed that the new regulatory landscape will mirror many of the provisions of the EU
regulatory regime, as contained within the EU Medical Devices Regulation. However, the response also
highlighted that in certain areas, medical devices regulation in Great Britain is likely to deviate from the EU
framework. The UK government now needs to translate its proposals into legislation, via amendments to the UK
Medical Devices Regulations (SI 2002 No 618, as amended). The regime is expected to come into force in July
2023, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements.

_Italy_

The Italian regulatory framework on the Devices, which transposes the corresponding EU regulatory
framework, classifies the Devices into three categories: “active implantable devices,” as defined under Legislative
Decree no. 507 of December 14, 1992 (transposing the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive), “general
medical devices,” as defined under Legislative Decree no. 46 of February 24, 1997 (transposing directive
93/42/EEC), and “in vitro diagnostic devices,” as defined under Legislative Decree no. 332 of September 8, 2000
(transposing the EU Medical Devices Directive). The Devices manufactured by the Group fall within the “general
medical devices” category referred to in Legislative Decree no. 46 of February 24, 1997 (“Decree 46/1997”).

Manufacturers that introduce Devices to the market are required to report their data to the Ministry of
Health, along with a description of the devices capable of identifying them, their labels and instructions for usage,
for entry into a specific database called the “Device Directory.”

The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Economic Development also oversee the proper application
of the national regulatory framework on the Devices through a system of inspections and controls at the
manufacturers and distributors of the devices. In addition, the monitoring and oversight of the Devices introduced
to the market also involve the manufacturers, operators and healthcare facilities (both public and private) that use
them, since such parties are required to report to the Ministry of Health any malfunctioning or alteration of the
characteristics and performances of a device, and any inadequacy in the labeling or usage instructions, that could
cause, or have caused, the death or serious deterioration in the health of a patient. In particular, a manufacturer is
required to report to the Ministry of Health of any accident of which it becomes aware, and of the corrective
actions undertaken to reduce the risks of death or serious deterioration in the health of patients associated with the
use of a Device. In the event that a causal nexus is ascertained between the accident and the medical device, the
actions that may be undertaken range from a modification of the design relating to the product to a change in
labeling or instructions on the use of the device, to its recall from the market. Similarly, when the Ministry of
Health finds that a device, even if installed and used correctly, may compromise the health and safety of patients,
users or third parties, it may order its recall from the market, to be handled by the manufacturer under its own
supervision and at its own expense, or ban or limit its introduction to the market.

Moreover, the Italian healthcare regulations, as recently supplemented, provide that a yearly budget to
purchase medical devices is assigned to each Italian region and, in case such yearly budget is exceeded, each
region shall ask for a reimbursement to the medical devices suppliers for a portion of the excess amount, and in
proportion to the annual market share of each supplier in the relevant region (the “Payback Mechanism”). In
particular, pursuant to Law Decree No. 115 of August 9, 2022 (as converted into Law No. 142/2022), the Italian
Ministry of Health determined the amounts in excess of the regional budgets for each of the years 2015, 2016,
2017 and 2018 in its Decree published on September 15, 2022 (the “Decree 216/2022”) and provided the
guidelines that the Italian regions shall apply when asking for reimbursements under the Payback Mechanism
with a Ministerial Decree published on October 6, 2022 (the “Decree 251/2022”). Pursuant to such mechanism,
each region shall issue payment orders to the medical device suppliers by mid-December 2022. Should a supplier
not pay the requested amounts in 30 days, Decree 216/2022 provides that such amounts are offset against any
outstanding credits such suppliers towards each region and/or the entities affiliated to the regional healthcare
system (the “Offset Mechanism”). With Law Decree No. 4 of January 11, 2023, the deadline for the payment of
all the amounts required under the Payback Mechanism has been postponed until April 30, 2023. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business—We derive a substantial portion of our business from_
_the award of public contracts, which requires frequent participation in competitive, highly regulated public tender_
_offer processes, often limit our ability to negotiate pricing and other terms and make us subject to changes in_
_public spending policies.”_

_United States_

The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety,
efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval,

198


-----

adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical
devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and
otherwise meet the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”).

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires
either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or FDA approval of a premarket approval application
(“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class
III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and
regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to
the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General
Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System
Regulation (“QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful
and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s
General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of
the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries
and FDA guidance documents.

While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement,
manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section
510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to
commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance.
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable
devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent
to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment
devices are unclassified but are subject to FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be
commercially distributed. The Group’s currently marketed products include Class I exempt devices and Class II
devices subject to 510(k) clearance.

_510(k) Clearance_

Certain of the Group’s current products are subject to premarket notification and clearance under section
510(k) of the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification
submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device. A predicate
device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally
marketed before May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has
been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the
510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but may take
longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding
substantial equivalence. In addition, FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual
fees for medical device establishments. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate
device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA
determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is
automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA
requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de
novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not
substantially equivalent to a predicate device.

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or
effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new
510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires
each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo
classification or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a
manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require
the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing
clearance, approval of a PMA, or issuance of a de novo classification. Also, in these circumstances, the
manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such
proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more
difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November
2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification

199


-----

pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop
proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals
included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance
pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial
equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or
adopted. More recently, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised final guidance describing an optional “safety
and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types”
to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets
objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers
to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance
process. The FDA has developed and maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance
based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance
criteria for each such device type, as well as recommended testing methods in the guidance documents where
feasible.

_PMA Approval_

Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment
Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required approval of a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process.
None of the Group’s products are currently marketed pursuant to a PMA. The PMA process is more demanding
than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is
safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and
human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full
description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following
receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive
review. If FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a
PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years.
An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and
provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the
panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant
or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the
QSR.

The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and
information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device
is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended
to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling,
promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study
that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may
condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public
health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period
of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years
and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the
conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.

Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality
control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness
of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same
type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes
from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of
an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as
when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or
when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that
were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance
of safety and effectiveness.

_Clinical Trials_

Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a
510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted
in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption ("IDE") regulations which govern investigational

200


-----

device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting
and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant
risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application
to the FDA, which must become effective before commencing human clinical trials. If the device under evaluation
does not present a significant risk to human health, then the device sponsor is not required to submit an IDE
application to the FDA before initiating human clinical trials, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE
requirements when conducting such trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk
to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life,
substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment
of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be
supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device
in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30
days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the
FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the
FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.

Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by,
and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board ("IRB") for each clinical site. The IRB is
responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct
of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin
at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the
device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval
for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE
requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and
labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that
the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not
determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the
continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a
sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness,
study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. Additionally, after a trial begins, the sponsor, the
FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that
the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.

_Post-Marketing Requirements_

After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements
continue to apply. These include:

      - establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;

      - QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow
stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during
all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;

      - labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or
the promotion of “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products;

      - requirements related to promotional activities;

      - clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could
significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended
use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved
devices;

      - medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a
device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has
malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or
contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;

201


-----

      - correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to
the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health
posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;

      - the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from
the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and

      - post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to
be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data
for the device.

Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the
QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production,
processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished
devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file,
device history file, and complaint files. Manufacturers are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled
inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down
of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products. The discovery of
previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse
events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its
clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device,
including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.

The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a
manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or
enforcement actions, which may result in a variety of sanctions, including: warning letters, untitled letters, fines,
injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our
products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying
requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; and
withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted.

In addition to the foregoing, the Group is required to comply with numerous U.S. federal and state laws,
as well as laws of other jurisdictions, on healthcare fraud and wrongful conduct, as well as provisions to combat
bribery, and on physician transparency, including:

  - the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits soliciting, offering, receiving or making payments (of an
unlawful nature) related to goods and/or services provided by federal healthcare assistance programs
(such as, for example, medicines and healthcare services for Medicare or Medicaid patients);

  - the presenting or causing to be presented a false claim or making, using or causing to be made or used
false records for purposes of presenting false claims to the detriment of the federal or state government;

  - the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and other
healthcare products covered by the three federal healthcare assistance programs, Medicare, Medicaid and
State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), to collect and track all financial relationships with
physicians and certain other licensed healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals and to report such
data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in order to increase the transparency of financial
relationships and eliminate potential conflicts of interests; and

  - the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health
Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and the respective
implementing regulations, including the Omnibus Final Rule published on January 25, 2013 (collectively,
the “HIPAA”), which prohibits the execution (or even attempted execution) of fraud or embezzlement
against any healthcare assistance plan, including private health insurance, using any means and/or
methods whatsoever.

_Legal provisions on intellectual property_

_Legal provisions on data privacy and security_

Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access
to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the
future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws
and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and
consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related
and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data,
including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving,
may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or
actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.

_Legal provisions on product safety and product liability_

As regards aspects related to safety, the Group’s products are manufactured in compliance with national,
community and international laws and regulations of the countries in which they are sold.

In the EU, the Group’s products bear the CE mark, which certifies the products’ conformity to the
requirements imposed. Outside of Europe, the Group obtains safety certifications for its products, requesting
quality and product certifications from national or international notified entities or third-party institutions.

The objective (strict) liability of manufacturers for damages caused to third parties by defective products
introduced by Directive 85/374/EC was transposed into the legislations of numerous European member states.
Under this directive, liability is excluded: the producer proves (a) that he did not put the product into circulation;
or (b) that, having regard to the circumstances, it is probable that the defect which caused the damage did not exist
at the time when the product was put into circulation by him or that this defect came into being afterwards; or (c)
that the product was neither manufactured by him for sale or any form of distribution for economic purpose nor
manufactured or distributed by him in the course of his business; or (d) that the defect is due to compliance of the
product with mandatory regulations issued by the public authorities; or (e) that the state of scientific and technical
knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence of the
defect to be discovered; or (f) in the case of a manufacturer of a component, that the defect is attributable to the
design of the product in which the component has been fitted or to the instructions given by the manufacturer of
the product.

The Group has various insurance policies in place to minimize consequences deriving from claims for
damages caused to third parties caused by defective products.

203


-----

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and as of the date of this offering
memorandum, the Issuer and the other companies of the Group have been involved as defendants in legal
proceedings concerning claims for damages caused by defective products, as well as recall campaigns concerning
the Group’s products. It should be noted, however, that such proceedings are covered by adequate insurance
policies. For more information on the Group’s insurance policies, see “Business—Insurance.”

_Information regarding any governmental, economic, fiscal, monetary or political policies or factors that have_
_materially affected, or could materially affect, directly or indirectly, the issuer’s operations of the Issuer or the_
_Group_

Demand for the products offered by the Group is influenced by the general economy, the economic trend,
and the business context of the countries and markets in which the Group operates, and by its customers’
investment plans and production levels. Such circumstance means that the Group’s business and the market in
which it operates are subject to a number of macroeconomic factors that the Issuer cannot anticipate, such as, inter
_alia, (i) the high level of geopolitical uncertainty which - as of the date of this offering memorandum – continues_
to characterize a number of emerging countries of interest to the Group; (ii) the growing protectionist drives by,
_inter alia, the United States of America, which could give rise to significant changes in customs, tax and regulatory_
policies and reduce the importance of the current free trade areas; (iii) the continuation or further worsening in
Italian financial conditions or a prolonged political instability in Italy; and (iv) the exit of the UK from the EU
and the end of the related transition period that took place on December 31, 2020.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Issuer is not aware of changes in laws or regulations in
the various countries in which it operates that could have an impact on the Group’s business or results of
operations.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

From time to time, we may enter into transactions with certain related parties or our affiliates and in the
ordinary course of our business. We believe these agreements are on terms no more favorable to the related parties
or our affiliates than what they would expect to negotiate with disinterested third-parties.

**PIK Loan Agreement**

On August 2, 2017, Emil Newco S.à r.l. entered into a €85.0 million payment-in-kind facility agreement
among Emil Newco S.à r.l., as borrower, and certain investors, as lenders, and the other parties thereto with an

were increased to provide additional support in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and Emil Newco S.à r.l.
further drew on the facility. Pursuant to a further amendment and restatement agreement, which we expect to enter
into on or about the Issue Date, the maturity of the PIK Loan Agreement will be extended to 2029. As of the Issue
Date, after giving effect to the amendment and restatement of the PIK Loan Agreement and the Refinancing, we
expect total drawings under the PIK Loan to be €159.5 million. The PIK Loan Agreement is subject to certain
affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, and is secured by a pledge over 100% of the shares of
Emil Holding II S.à r.l.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

Set forth below is a summary of certain of our future significant debt arrangements. The following
summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the
underlying documents. The defined terms set forth in this section apply to this section only.

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and structure_**

On or prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer, the financial institutions named therein as mandated lead
arrangers (together, the “Mandated Lead Arrangers”), the financial institutions named therein as original
lenders, Global Loan Agency Services Limited as agent and GLAS Trust Corporation Limited as Security Agent,
will have entered into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will provide for borrowings of up to an aggregate principal
amount of €65.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower (subject
to certain exceptions) under the Revolving Credit Facility in euro or certain other currencies by the drawing of
cash advances or, subject to the appointment of an Issuing Bank, the issue of bank guarantees and documentary
credits (including letters of credit and performance bonds) and by way of ancillary facilities. Subject to certain
exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time. The borrowings will be available to be
used to finance or refinance the general corporate purposes and/or working capital requirements of the Group,
including, without limitation, the financing or refinancing of capital expenditure, any Permitted Acquisition
(including purchase price adjustments, however structured), Permitted Joint Ventures, operational restructurings
and reorganisation requirements of the Group, financing or refinancing Indebtedness of the Group (including any
Indebtedness existing at the Closing Date) or any acquisition target, together with any related breakage costs,
redemption premium, make-whole costs, any required original issue discount and/or additional OID fees, any
market flex or ticking fees and/or any interest accruing on indebtedness, and paying any related fees, costs and
expenses) but excluding the financing or repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, Super Senior Liabilities, Second
Lien Liabilities or Senior Unsecured Liabilities (each such term as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or any
related Refinancing Indebtedness (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

**_Additional Facilities_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contemplates the incurrence of additional uncommitted
revolving facilities in a maximum amount not to exceed (after taking account of the commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility) the amount able to be incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “The Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”, whether as a
new facility and/or as an additional tranche of any existing facility and/or by increasing the commitments under
an existing facility. Such additional facilities shall rank _pari passu_ with the Revolving Credit Facility and be
prepaid on a pro rata basis (including with respect to mandatory prepayments). The lenders of any such additional
facilities shall not have the benefit of (x) guarantees from any member of the Group which is not an Obligor or
(y) security over assets other than the then existing Transaction Security (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement), except where the same security (to the extent permitted by law) is granted in respect of the
other facilities under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The availability, maturity, pricing and other terms of any additional facility will be those agreed between
the Issuer and the relevant lenders of that additional facility. No additional facility may have a maturity date that
is earlier than the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility other than (x) any additional facility where the
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility are offered a right to amend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit
Facility to a date on or prior to the final maturity date of such additional facility or (y) any additional facility
which is being used to refinance the Revolving Credit Facility in full.

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilised
from the Issue Date until the date falling one month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

The Issuer is the original borrower and the original guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility. A
mechanism is included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to enable certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries

209


-----

to accede as a borrower and/or a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to certain conditions. The
Revolving Credit Facility also requires that each Material Company (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) that is a Material Company on the Issue Date becomes a guarantor within 90 days of the Issue Date
(subject to agreed security principles) and in the future certain other entities as needed for the Guarantor Coverage
Test (as defined below) will also become guarantors (subject to agreed security principles and/or any legal
prohibitions).

**_Maturity and Repayment Requirements_**

The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the date falling three months prior to the maturity of the Notes.
Each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism
against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility must be
repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the Revolving Credit Facility.

Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be re-borrowed
during the availability period for that facility, subject to certain conditions.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

The interest rate on cash advances under the Revolving Credit Facility will be the rate per annum equal
to the aggregate of the applicable margin and EURIBOR (as such term is defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement). The initial margin under the Revolving Credit Facility will be 3.75%. Beginning from the date which
falls six months from the Closing Date, provided no Material Event of Default (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) has occurred and is continuing, the margin on the loans will be reduced if certain
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratios (which are to be calculated in a manner similar to the Notes
(with certain additional caps on pro forma adjustments when calculating such ratios)) are met.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from (and including) the Issue Date to (and including) the last day of the availability period for the
Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 35% of the then applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. The
commitment fee will be payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the availability period of the Revolving
Credit Facility and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which a lender
cancels its commitment. No commitment fee shall be payable unless the Issue Date occurs.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the agent and the security agent in connection
with the Revolving Credit Facility, and on the Issue Date will pay an underwriting fee to the original lenders.

**_Guarantees_**

The Issuer will provide senior guarantees of all amounts payable to (x) the Finance Parties (as defined in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) by the Issuer, or as applicable, any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries which
accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as an additional borrower or an additional guarantor and (y)
the hedging banks under certain secured hedging agreements (pursuant to the New Intercreditor Agreement).

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires that (subject to agreed security principles), within 90
days of the Issue Date (x) each subsidiary of the Issuer that is a Material Company (which definition includes,
among other things, any wholly-owned member of the Group incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction (as defined
in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) that has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
representing more than 5% of Consolidated EBITDA) on the Issue Date and (y) such other subsidiaries of the
Issuer incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction as is necessary to ensure that the guarantors represent not less than
80% of the aggregate EBITDA of wholly-owned Group Companies (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) incorporated in Guarantor Jurisdictions (subject to certain exceptions) (the “Guarantor Coverage
**Test”) will be required to become a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.**

Furthermore, if on the last day of each financial year of the Issuer, the Guarantor Coverage Test is not
met, within 120 days of delivery of the annual financial statements for the relevant financial year, each relevant
Material Company and such other subsidiaries of the Issuer (subject to agreed security principles and certain other
exceptions) are required to become guarantors until the Guarantor Coverage Test is satisfied (to be calculated as
if such additional guarantors had been guarantors on the last day of the relevant financial year).

210


-----

**_Security_**

It is expected that on the Issue Date, the Revolving Credit Facility (subject to certain agreed security
principles set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral (as
further described in the section entitled “Description of the Notes—Security”). Within 90 days of the Issue Date,
the Revolving Credit Facility (subject to certain agreed security principles set out in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) will be secured by the Post-Closing Collateral (as further described in the section entitled
“Description of the Notes—Security Agent.”

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the collateral (whether
or not shared with the holders of the Notes) will be required to be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding under
the Revolving Credit Facility in priority to the Notes.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties,
subject to certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets, and
with certain representations and warranties being repeated, including: (i) status and incorporation; (ii) binding
obligations; (iii) non-conflict with constitutional documents, laws or other obligations; (iv) power and authority;
(v) validity and admissibility in evidence; (vi) governing law and enforcement; (vi) no default; (vii) accuracy of
most recent financial statements delivered; (viii) no proceedings pending or threatened; (ix) no breach of laws;
(x) taxation; (xi) intellectual property; (xii) legal and beneficial ownership; (xiii) sanctions and anti-corruption;
(xiv) no filing or stamp taxes; (xv) federal reserve regulations; (xvi) investment company status and (xvii) pari
_passu ranking._

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the same incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments) that apply to the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility also
contains certain affirmative and negative covenants. Set forth below is a brief description of such covenants, all
of which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge or other qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

**_Affirmative Covenants_**

The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information, including
annual audited and quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates; (ii) authorizations, (iii) compliance
with laws; (iv) payment of taxes; (v) maintenance of pari passu and priority and payment ranking of the Revolving
Credit Facility; (vi) maintenance of intellectual property; (vii) maintenance of Guarantor Coverage Test; (viii)
anti-bribery programme; (ix) granting of additional guarantees and security in prescribed circumstances; and (x)
further assurance provisions.

**_Negative Covenants_**

The negative covenants include restrictions, among others, with respect to: (i) changing the centre of
main interest of a borrower or guarantor; and (ii) sanctions and anti-corruption. Otherwise, the negative covenants
in the Revolving Credit Facility are substantially the same as the negative covenants in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

**_Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control_**

The Issuer is required to notify the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement of a Change of
Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), following which each lender under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is entitled to notify the Issuer requiring repayment of all outstanding
amounts owed to that lender and the cancellation of that lender’s commitments. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any ancillary lender or, as the case may be, Issuing Bank may, as between itself and the relevant member of the
Group, agree to continue to provide such ancillary facility or, as the case may be, Letter(s) of Credit (with such
arrangements continuing on a bilateral basis and not as part of, or under, the Finance Documents and the
Transaction Security shall not, following release by the Security Agent, secure any such Letter(s) of Credit or
ancillary facility in respect of any claims that arise after such cancellation).

211


-----

**_Financial Covenant_**

The Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant providing that the Issuer shall ensure that
Super Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) in respect of each testing period ending
on and after the testing period ending after the first complete financial quarter after the Issue Date shall not exceed
1.53:1, which shall not be tested unless 40% of the Revolving Credit Facility and/or any additional facility has
been drawn (i) excluding from such calculation amounts utilised in respect of e.g. fees, letters of credit, ancillary
facilities, capital expenditure and acquisitions up to an amount set out in the Revolving Credit Facility; and (ii)
deducting any cash and cash equivalents of the Group. In the event the financial covenant would not be complied
with when tested, new equity or subordinated debt may be injected into the Issuer to cure the breach. No new
equity or subordinated debt may be injected more than twice in any three consecutive financial quarters, or more
than five times during the life of the Revolving Credit Facility. A breach of the financial covenant will only permit
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to prevent a new utilization of the Revolving Credit
Facility (excluding rollover of existing utilizations) and will not constitute, or result in, a breach of any
representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or Finance
Documents pertaining thereto or result in a default or event of default thereunder.

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for some of the same events of default, with certain
adjustments, as under the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for certain customary events
of default, all of which are subject to customary materiality and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or
grace periods, as appropriate, including: (i) representations or warranties found to be untrue or misleading when
made or deemed repeated subject to a 60-day grace period; (ii) unlawfulness and invalidity subject to a 60 day
grace period; (iii) failure to comply with a material term of, or breach of representation or warranty by certain
parties under, the Intercreditor Agreement subject to a 60 day grace period; (iv) repudiation and rescission; and
(v) certain events of default consistent with the insolvency events of default, with certain adjustments, as under
the Notes.

**_Material Adverse Effect_**

In the Revolving Credit Facility, the term “Material Adverse Effect” means any event or circumstances
or series of events or circumstances which, taking into account all the circumstances, is or is likely to be materially
adverse to the business, assets or financial condition of the Group (taken as a whole) such that the Group (taken
as a whole) would not be able to perform its payment obligations under the Finance Documents (taking into
account resources available to it) and if capable of remedy, is not remedied within 20 Business Days of the earlier
of the Company becoming aware of the issue or the Company being given written notice of the issue by the Agent.

**_Governing Law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be governed by English law provided that the information
undertakings, negative covenants, events of default and New York law definitions listed in the relevant schedules
to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with the law of the State of New
York.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain current and future creditors (the “Creditors”) under certain debt
documents, Emil Holding II S.à r.l. (for the purposes of this section, the “Parent”, and the Parent and its restricted
subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as the “Parent Group” and any person that is a member of the Parent

Lien Representative(s) (with a copy to the Company); and

No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served by any Agent or the Security Agent in reliance on
a particular Material Event of Default more than 90 days after a Senior Agent (or Super Senior Agent or Secured

Agreement or Senior Secured Notes Indenture) advising of the occurrence of that Material Event of Default.

No more than one Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or
set of circumstances, and (ii) in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities, may be served in any period of 365 days.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Second Lien Finance Documents as a result of the issue of
a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default (as defined below)
shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in
relation to the relevant Second Lien Finance Documents or (ii) the issue of a Second Lien Enforcement Notice on
behalf of the relevant Second Lien Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalisation of Interest Continue: Second Lien Liabilities_

(including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Second Lien Finance Document by the
operation of the provisions set out under each section above under “—Restrictions Relating to the Second Lien
Creditors and the Second Lien Liabilities” even if its obligation to make that payment is restricted at any time by
the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalisation of interest in accordance with the relevant Second Lien Finance
Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop: Second Lien Creditors_

If:

    - at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Secured Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or
the Senior Secured Payment Default ceases to be continuing (as the case may be); and

an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the relevant Second Lien Finance
Documents and which would have been Permitted Second Lien Payments but for that Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default,

then any event of default which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be
waived and any Second Lien Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that event of default
shall be waived and revoked, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Second Lien
Creditors.

will, enter into any Second Lien Debt Purchase Transaction (as such term may be defined in the Second Lien

    - make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that Debtor
or Third Party Security Provider in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities;

    - exercise any right of set–off or take or receive any payment or claim in respect of any Second Lien
Liabilities of that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider; or

    - claim and prove in the liquidation, administration or other insolvency proceedings of that Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider for the Second Lien Liabilities owing to it.

No Second Lien Creditor or Second Lien Representative thereof may take any Enforcement Action that is
otherwise permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement while the Security Agent is taking such Enforcement
Action or such steps to enforce the transaction security, in each case, where such action may be reasonably likely
to adversely affect such enforcement or Enforcement Action or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Second Lien Creditors_

Upon a Distress Event (in each case, excluding any Distress Event which arises solely by virtue of an
acceleration of the Second Lien Liabilities) or whilst a Second Lien Standstill Period is continuing or a Second
Lien Payment Stop Notice is outstanding or a Senior Secured Payment Default (as defined below under “—Senior
Unsecured Payment Blockage Provisions”) is continuing, the Second Lien Representative (on behalf of the
Second Lien Creditors or those Second Lien Creditors that wish to make the relevant purchase) may by not less
than 10 days’ elect to purchase the outstanding Senior Lender Liabilities, the Super Senior Lender Liabilities, the
Operating Facility Liabilities and the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been
required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses and provide cash cover
in respect of any letters of credit that are outstanding. The relevant Second Lien Creditors must also elect for the
Hedge Counterparties to transfer their Hedging Liabilities to them at the same time in exchange for the amount
that would have been payable under the relevant Hedging Agreements had they been terminated on such date plus
certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase. A Hedge Counterparty and the relevant
purchasing Second Lien Creditors may agree that the requirement to transfer the Hedging Liabilities does not
apply to any Hedging Agreement to which the relevant Hedge Counterparty is a party. The Intercreditor
Agreement sets out the terms that apply to any purchase of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Super Senior Lender
Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities.

respect of the Senior Unsecured Liabilities during a period when a Senior Unsecured Payment
Stop Notice was outstanding;

      - following the occurrence of an event of default under a Senior Unsecured Finance Document
(which is continuing), all (and not part only) of the Senior Unsecured Liabilities thereunder as

Liabilities which is then due by the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer or the Senior Unsecured Borrower (or, in the
case of a payment of Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, which will fall due within five business days) and which
is a Permitted Senior Unsecured Payment.

_Senior Unsecured Payment Blockage Provisions_

Until the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Second Lien Discharge Date, except with
the prior consent of the Senior Agent under each Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, each Super Senior Agent
under each Super Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Agent under each Second Lien Facility
Agreement and (to the extent otherwise prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and/or the Second
Lien Notes Indenture(s)) the consent of the relevant Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) and/or the Second Lien
Notes Trustee(s) subject to the provisions set out under “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” below,
the Debtors that are Group Companies shall not make (and the Company shall procure that no Group Company

may receive from a Debtor that is a Group Company (or from any other Group Company), any Permitted Senior
Unsecured Payment (other than any payments expressly referred to in the Intercreditor Agreement) if:

229


-----

- an event of default for non-payment of principal, interest or fees under any Senior Finance Document
or applicable Hedging Agreement (each a “Senior Payment Default”) or a Super Senior Finance
Document or applicable Hedging Agreement (a “Super Senior Payment Default”) or a Senior
Secured Notes Finance Document (in each case, subject to a de minimis amount) (each a “Senior
**Secured Payment Default”) is continuing;**

- an event of default for non-payment under a Second Lien Finance Document (subject to a de minimis
amount) (a “Second Lien Payment Default”) is continuing; or

- either (i) an event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement or a Super Senior Facilities
Agreement or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) (other
than a Senior Secured Payment Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day after
the date on which the Senior Agent(s), a Super Senior Agent(s) or the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee(s) (as the case may be) (or, in either case, the Security Agent on its behalf) delivers a notice
or (ii) an event of default under (as applicable) the Second Lien Facility Agreement or the Second
Lien Notes Indenture (a “Second Lien Event of Default”) (other than a Second Lien Payment
Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the date on which a Second
Lien Representative(s) (or the Security Agent on its behalf) delivers a notice (any such notice under
(i) and (ii) being a “Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance
in relation to that Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default (as applicable)
to the Company, the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) until the earliest
of:

  - the date falling 179 days after receipt by the Company of that Senior Unsecured Payment Stop
Notice;

  - if a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period (as defined below under “—Senior Unsecured Standstill
Period”) is in effect at any time after delivery of that Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice,
the date on which that standstill period expires;

  - the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default
(as applicable) has been remedied or waived in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance
Documents or with the Second Lien Finance Documents (as applicable);

  - the date on which a Senior Unsecured Default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original
scheduled maturity of the relevant Senior Unsecured Liabilities;

  - the date on which the Senior Agent, Super Senior Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s)
or the relevant Second Lien Representative (as applicable) delivers a notice to the Company,
the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) cancelling the Senior Unsecured
Payment Stop Notice; and

  - the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Second Lien Discharge Date.

Unless the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) waive this requirement (i) no new Senior
Unsecured Payment Stop Notice may be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the
delivery of the immediately prior Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice, (ii) no Senior Unsecured
Payment Stop Notice may be delivered in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of Default more than
60 days after each Senior Agent, each Super Senior Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee
(as applicable) received notice of that Senior Secured Event of Default and (iii) no Senior Unsecured
Payment Stop Notice may be delivered in reliance on a Second Lien Event of Default more than 60
days after each Second Lien Agent and each Second Lien Notes Trustee (as applicable) received
notice of that Second Lien Event of Default.

The Senior Agent(s), Super Senior Agent(s), Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) or Second
Lien Representative(s) may only serve one Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice with respect to
the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall
not affect the right of the Senior Agent(s), the Super Senior Agent(s), the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee(s) or the Second Lien Representative(s) to issue a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice
in respect of any other event or set of circumstances. No Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice
may be served by a Senior Agent, a Super Senior Agent, a Senior Secured Notes Trustee or a Second

230


-----

Lien Representative(s) (or the Security Agent on its behalf) in respect of a Senior Secured Event of
Default or Second Lien Event of Default which had been notified to the Senior Agent(s), Super
Senior Agent(s), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) or the Second Lien Representative(s) at the
time at which an earlier Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice was issued.

    - The above provisions:

      - act as a suspension of payment and not as a waiver of the right to receive payment on the date
such payments are due;

      - will not prevent the accrual or capitalization of interest (including default interest) in accordance
with the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents;

      - will not prevent the payment of any Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee Amounts or any Senior
Unsecured Agent Liabilities; and

      - will not prevent the payment of certain customary fees, taxes, costs and expenses and other
reasonable and ordinary course administrative and maintenance costs and expenses in an
amount not exceeding EUR 6 million (or its equivalent in other currencies) in any financial
year.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents or Senior Unsecured
Proceeds Loan Agreement as a result of the issue of a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence
of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an
event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Senior Unsecured
Finance Documents or Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Agreement or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice
with respect to the relevant event of default on behalf of the Senior Unsecured Creditors by the relevant Senior
Unsecured Representative(s) (a “Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice”).

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue: Senior Unsecured Liabilities_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which
shall continue to accrue) under any Senior Unsecured Finance Document or Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan
Agreement by the operation of the provisions set out under each section above under “—Restrictions Relating to
_the Senior Unsecured Creditors and the Senior Unsecured Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment_
is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Senior Unsecured Finance
Documents or Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Agreement shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Senior
Unsecured Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop: Senior Unsecured Creditors_

If:

    - at any time following the issue of a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Secured Payment Default or a Second Lien Payment Default, that Senior Unsecured Payment
Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default
and/or Second Lien Payment Default (as applicable) ceases to be continuing; and

    - the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Unsecured Creditors or the Senior Unsecured
Proceeds Loan Borrower (as applicable) an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under
the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents or the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Senior Unsecured Payments but for that Senior
Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default,

then any event of default which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be
waived and any Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that
event of default shall be waived or revoked, in each case without any further action being required on
the part of the Senior Unsecured Creditors or Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Lender.

231


-----

_Senior Unsecured Debt Purchase Transactions_

The Debtors shall not, and shall procure that no other Group Company will, enter into any debt purchase
transaction (as described in the Senior Unsecured Facilities Agreement) or beneficially own all or any part of the
share capital of a company that is a Senior Unsecured Creditor or a party to a Senior Unsecured Debt Purchase
Transaction unless such action occurs:

    - either: (i) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Second Lien Discharge
Date; or (ii) with the prior consent of (a) the Majority Senior Creditors, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors and (to the extent prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Finance Documents) the
Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) and (b) the Majority Second Lien Lenders and (to the extent
prohibited under the Second Lien Notes Finance Documents) the Second Lien Notes Trustee; and

    - in accordance with the relevant Senior Unsecured Finance Documents.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers: Senior Unsecured Creditors_

Subject to the following paragraph, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Unsecured
Creditors (and the Debtors and any relevant Parent Group Company (as appropriate)) may amend or waive the
terms of the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents (other than the Intercreditor Agreement) or any Senior
Unsecured Proceeds Loan in accordance with their terms at any time.

Prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Second Lien Discharge Date, the Senior
Unsecured Finance Parties and the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Lender (and the Debtors and any relevant
Parent Group Company) may not, except with the relevant prior consents required under the Intercreditor
Agreement, amend or waive the terms of the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents or any Senior Unsecured
Proceeds Loan if the amendment or waiver would result in the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents or Senior
Unsecured Proceeds Loan Agreement being inconsistent with any requirements in respect thereof set out in any
Senior Finance Document, Super Senior Finance Document, Senior Secured Notes Finance Document, Second
Lien Loan Finance Document or Second Lien Notes Finance Document.

_Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Unsecured Finance Party_

Until the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Second Lien Discharge Date, except with
the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group:

    - no Senior Unsecured Finance Party shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise (to the
extent applicable) require the enforcement of, any transaction security documents;

    - no Senior Unsecured Finance Party shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in
relation to the Senior Unsecured Liabilities; and

    - the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Lender shall not take or require the taking of any Enforcement
Action in relation to the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Liabilities,

except as permitted under the provisions set out under “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Enforcement” below,
provided, however, that any Senior Unsecured Finance Party may take Enforcement Action against any Senior
Unsecured Notes Issuer or Senior Unsecured Borrower or Senior Unsecured Finco Guarantor (other than with
respect to any transaction security or any assets of a Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer or Senior Unsecured Borrower
subject thereto) or with respect to any Senior Unsecured Only Security in accordance with the terms of any Senior
Unsecured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Senior Unsecured Enforcement_

The restrictions set out under “—Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Unsecured Creditors” above will
not apply in respect of the Senior Unsecured Liabilities or the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Liabilities (as
applicable), if:

    - an event of default (the “Relevant Senior Unsecured Default”) is continuing under (as applicable)
the Senior Unsecured Facilities Agreement and/or the Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture (a “Senior
**Unsecured Event of Default”);**

232


-----

    - the Senior Agent(s), the Super Senior Agent(s), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) and the Second
Lien Representative(s) have received a notice of the Relevant Senior Unsecured Default specifying
the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Unsecured Default from the relevant
Senior Unsecured Representative(s);

    - a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed or is otherwise terminated; and

    - the Relevant Senior Unsecured Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Unsecured
Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Unsecured Event of Default, the relevant Senior Unsecured
Representative(s) may by notice (a “Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior
Agent(s), the Super Senior Agent(s), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s) and the Second Lien Representative(s)
of the existence of such Senior Unsecured Event of Default.

_Senior Unsecured Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Senior Unsecured Default, a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period shall mean the
period beginning on the date (the “Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Unsecured
Representative(s) serves a Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice on the Senior Agent(s), the Super Senior
Agent(s) and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s), the Second Lien Agent(s) and the Second Lien Notes Trustee(s)
in respect of such Relevant Senior Unsecured Event of Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

    - the date falling 179 days after the Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date (the “Senior Unsecured
**Standstill Period”);**

    - the date the Senior Secured Creditors or the Second Lien Creditors take any Enforcement Action in
relation to a particular Debtor, provided, however, that:

      - if a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Senior Unsecured
Finance Parties or the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Lender (in respect only of the Senior
Unsecured Proceeds Loan Liabilities) may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation
to the Debtor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien
Creditors (as applicable) against such Debtor and not against any other Parent Group Company;
and

      - “Enforcement Action” for the purposes of this paragraph shall not include action taken to
preserve or protect security (as opposed to enforcing it in order to realize the proceeds from
such enforcement);

    - the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined below) in relation to a particular Debtor (other than one
directly caused by any action taken by a Senior Unsecured Finance Party or the Senior Unsecured
Proceeds Loan Lender) against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken, in which case, (unless
otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has given notice
that it intends to take, action on behalf of that Senior Unsecured Creditor) the Senior Unsecured
Creditors or the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Lender (in respect only of the Senior Unsecured
Proceeds Loan Liabilities) may exercise any right they may otherwise have against that Debtor to:

      - accelerate any of that Debtor’s Senior Unsecured Group Liabilities or declare them prematurely
due and payable or payable on demand;

      - make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that
Debtor in respect of any Senior Unsecured Group Liabilities;

      - exercise any right of set–off or take or receive any payment or claim in respect of any Senior
Unsecured Group Liabilities of that Debtor; or

      - claim and prove in the liquidation, administration or other insolvency proceedings of that Debtor
for the Senior Unsecured Group Liabilities owing to it;

233


-----

    - the expiry of any other Senior Unsecured Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Senior Unsecured Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of
a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy); and

    - the date on which the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors consent to an enforcement
in respect of the Relevant Senior Unsecured Default by the relevant Senior Unsecured Finance
Parties or the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Lender.

_Subsequent Senior Unsecured Defaults_

The Senior Unsecured Finance Parties or the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Lender (in respect only
of the Senior Unsecured Proceeds Loan Liabilities) may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out
under “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Senior Unsecured Default
even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Unsecured Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Senior
Unsecured Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Senior Unsecured Default.

_Enforcement on behalf of Senior Unsecured Finance Parties_

No Senior Unsecured Creditor or Senior Unsecured Representative may (and the Senior Unsecured
Proceeds Loan Lender may not) take any Enforcement Action while the Security Agent is taking, or has been
instructed by an Instructing Group (or the Majority Second Lien Creditors to the extent then entitled to give
instructions to the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement) to take, Enforcement Action against a
Debtor or steps to enforce all or any part of the transaction security, where such action may be reasonably likely
to adversely affect such enforcement or Enforcement Action or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

Any Enforcement Action on behalf of Senior Unsecured Finance Parties must require the realization of
the relevant security by way of a sale or disposal conducted in accordance with the provisions set out under “—
_Distressed Disposals” and “—Second Lien and Senior Unsecured Debt Protection”._

_Option to Purchase: Senior Unsecured Creditors_

Upon a Distress Event (excluding any Distress Event which arises solely by virtue of a Senior Unsecured
Acceleration Event), or whilst a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period is continuing or a Senior Unsecured Payment
Stop Notice is outstanding or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default is continuing, the
Senior Unsecured Representative(s) on behalf of the Senior Unsecured Creditors (or those Senior Unsecured
Creditors that wish to make the relevant purchase) may by not less than 10 days’ notice elect to purchase the
outstanding Senior Lender Liabilities, the Super Senior Lender Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the
Second Lien Loan Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and the Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the
amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and
expenses and provide cash cover in respect of any letters of credit that are outstanding. The relevant Senior
Unsecured Creditors must also elect for the Hedge Counterparties to transfer their Hedging Liabilities to them at
the same time in exchange for the amount that would have been payable under the relevant Hedging Agreements
had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase. A
Hedge Counterparty and the relevant purchasing Senior Unsecured Creditors may agree that the requirement to
transfer the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities does not apply to any Hedging Agreement to which the Hedge
Counterparty is a party. The Intercreditor Agreement sets out the terms that apply to any purchase of the Senior
Lender Liabilities, the Super Senior Lender Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities the Second Lien Loan
Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Second Lien Notes Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

An “Insolvency Event” occurs in relation to any Parent Group Company if:

    - any resolution is passed or order made for its winding up, dissolution, administration, judicial
management or reorganization of that Parent Group Company, a moratorium is declared in relation
to any of that Parent Group Company’s indebtedness or an administrator or judicial manager is
appointed to that Parent Group Company;

    - any composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement is made with its creditors generally; or

    - a liquidator, receiver, administrator, judicial manager, administrative receiver, compulsory manager
or other similar officer is appointed in respect of that Parent Group Company or any of its assets; or

234


-----

    - any procedure or step analogous to any of those set out in the immediately preceding paragraph is
taken in respect of a Parent Group Company in any jurisdiction,

in each case, which is an event of default under the debt documents or is taken when an Event of Default
is continuing.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any
Parent Group Company, any party to the Intercreditor Agreement entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets
of that Parent Group Company (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor only to the extent that such amounts
constitute enforcement proceeds) in respect of Liabilities owed to that party shall, to the extent it is able to do so,
direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that Parent Group Company to pay that
distribution to the Security Agent until the Liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. In this
respect, the Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds” below._

Generally, but subject to certain limited exceptions, to the extent that any Parent Group Company’s
Liabilities are discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event
in relation to that Parent Group Company, any creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement which benefited
from that set-off shall (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor only to the extent that such amounts constitute
enforcement proceeds) pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by
that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application
_of Proceeds” below._

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any of the Liabilities owed to them by a Parent Group Company, the Liabilities will not be reduced by
that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such
Liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Parent Group Company, each creditor
regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent, in its name and on its behalf
(and to the extent permitted under applicable law) to:

    - take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) against
that Parent Group Company;

    - demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that Parent Group Company’s Liabilities;

    - collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that Parent Group Company’s
Liabilities; and

    - file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover that Parent Group Company’s Liabilities.

Each creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement will (i) do all things that the Security Agent reasonably
requests in order to give effect to the matters disclosed under this section “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of
_Claims” and (ii) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this section or if_
the Security Agent requests that a creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement take that action, undertake
that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of attorney to the
Security Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent may reasonably require, although no notes trustee shall be
under any obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain customary exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any creditor
regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement (other than a Senior Secured Creditor) receives or recovers from any
Parent Group Company:

    - any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the Liabilities which is not
either (i) a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) made in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

    - any amount:

        - after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any transaction security;
or

        - as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against a Parent Group Company (other
than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Parent Group Company);
or

      - by way of set-off in respect of any of the Liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any transaction security,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

      - the proceeds of any enforcement of any transaction security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

      - any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the
liabilities owed by any Parent Group Company which is not in accordance with the provisions
set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or after, the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Parent Group Company, or

    - if at any time prior to the latest to occur of the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien
Discharge Date and the Senior Unsecured Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or
recovers any enforcement proceeds or any other amounts which should otherwise by received or
recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—
_Application of Proceeds” from any Debtor, any member of the Group or any Third Party Security_
Provider,

that creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement will: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received
or recovered by way of set-off (a) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if
less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay such amount to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and (b) promptly pay
an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) in relation to
receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

“Enforcement” is defined in a customary manner for transactions of this nature and includes (i) the
enforcement of any Transaction Security, the requesting of a Distressed Disposal (as defined below), the giving
of instructions as to actions with respect to Transaction Security following a Distress Event and the taking of any
other consequential actions, or (ii) as the context so requires, the enforcement of Senior Unsecured Only Security,
the giving of instructions with respect to Senior Unsecured Only Security and the taking of any other consequential
actions.

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the transaction security or taking other Enforcement
Action unless instructed otherwise (i) in accordance with the paragraph immediately below, (ii) if required under
the sixth paragraph of this section, the Majority Second Lien Creditors or (iii) if required under the sixth paragraph
of this section, and so far as it relates to the Senior Unsecured Shared Security only, the Majority Senior Unsecured
Creditors.

236


-----

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms: (i) if either
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue instructions as to
Enforcement Action to the Security Agent (the “Enforcement Instructions”), the Agents (and, if applicable,
Hedge Counterparties) representing the Secured Creditors comprising the Majority Super Senior Creditors or
Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as the case may be) shall deliver a copy of those proposed Enforcement
Instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent, each Senior Agent, each Super Senior
Agent, each Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each Hedge Counterparty which did not deliver such Initial
Enforcement Notice, and those Enforcement Instructions shall be consistent with the Enforcement Principles (as
defined below), which include but are not limited to (x) any enforcement shall be consistent with the object of
maximizing the value realized from Enforcement, to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious
realization of value and (y) transaction security will be enforced such that all proceeds of enforcement are received
by the Security Agent in cash (the “Enforcement Principles”), (ii) subject to the sub-paragraphs below, the
Security Agent will act in accordance with Enforcement Instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors, provided that such instructions are consistent with the Enforcement Principles (and the Security Agent
shall be entitled to assume that such instructions are consistent with the Enforcement Principles) and failure to
give Enforcement Instructions will be deemed to be an instruction not to take any Enforcement Action:

    - if (A) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of
Enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent of
that determination in writing) within three months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice, (B)
the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the date of the Initial
Enforcement Notice, then the Security Agent will act in accordance with Enforcement Instructions
received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has
occurred;

    - if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by any Enforcement Action
taken by or at the request or direction of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing then the Security
Agent will, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors elect to provide such Enforcement
Instructions, act in accordance with Enforcement Instructions received from the Majority Super
Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred; and

    - if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of
Enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent of
that determination in writing) and the Majority Super Senior Creditors: (A) determine in good faith
(and notify the other Senior Agents, each Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Hedge Counterparties
and the Security Agent) that a delay in issuing Enforcement Instructions could reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction
Security or on the expected realisation proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security and
(B) deliver Enforcement Instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the
Enforcement Principles and necessary or advisable to enhance the prospects of achieving the
Enforcement Objective before the Security Agent has received any Enforcement Instructions from
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, then the Security Agent will act in accordance with
Enforcement Instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Senior
Discharge Date has occurred.

Subject to the following paragraphs, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, (i) if the Instructing
Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the transaction security or (ii) in the
absence of instructions from the Instructing Group, and, if in each case, both the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
and the Majority Super Senior Creditors have not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the transaction security
which the Majority Second Lien Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent under the provisions
under “—Restriction on Enforcement: Second Lien Creditors” or to enforce the Senior Unsecured Shared Security
which the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors are then entitled to give under “—Permitted Senior Unsecured
_Enforcement”._

Subject to the following paragraphs, following the Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the Second
Lien Discharge Date and the Senior Unsecured Discharge Date, (i) if both Majority Senior Secured Creditors and
the Majority Super Senior Secured Creditors have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease
enforcing the Senior Unsecured Shared Security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from the Instructing Group,
and, if in each case, the Instructing Group has not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Senior Unsecured

237


-----

Shared Security which the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent
under the provisions under “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Enforcement”.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, if at any time the Second Lien Representative(s) is then
entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the transaction security pursuant to the preceding
paragraphs and the Second Lien Representative(s) either gives such instruction or indicates any intention to give
such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the transaction
security as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given by the Second Lien
Representative(s) under the paragraphs above and the Security Agent shall instead act on such instructions
received from the Instructing Group.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, if at any time the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) is then
entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Senior Unsecured Shared Security pursuant to the
preceding paragraphs and the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) either gives such instruction or indicates any
intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce
the Senior Unsecured Shares Security as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given
by the Senior Unsecured Representative(s) under the provisions set out under the paragraphs above and the
Security Agent shall instead act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group.

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any
transaction security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the transaction security documents except
through the Security Agent subject to certain customary exceptions.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security is being enforced or other action as to Enforcement is being taken as set forth
above under “—Enforcement Instructions,” the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security or take such
other action as to Enforcement in such manner (including, without limitation, and to the extent permitted under
applicable law, the selection of any administrator (or any analogous officer in any jurisdiction) of any Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as:

    - the Instructing Group;

    - prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the preceding
section, received instructions given by the Majority Second Lien Creditors to enforce the transaction
security or the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors to enforce the Senior Unsecured Shared
Security and (ii) the Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the manner of enforcement
of the transaction security, the Majority Second Lien Creditors, or, as applicable, the Majority Senior
Unsecured Creditors; or

    - following the Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date and the
Senior Unsecured Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the preceding section,
received instructions given by the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors to enforce the Senior
Unsecured Shared Security, and (ii) the Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the manner
of enforcement of the Senior Unsecured Shared Security, the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors,

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

Each creditor regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement (other than the Senior Secured Creditors, the
Second Lien Creditors and the Senior Unsecured Creditors) agrees in the Intercreditor Agreement (to the fullest
extent permitted by law at the relevant time) with the Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put
to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, preinsolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any Parent Group Company as instructed by the
Security Agent. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an
Instructing Group.

No party to the Intercreditor Agreement is entitled to exercise or require any Primary Creditor to exercise
such power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for (or change the basis
for accrual of any) payment of or reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that Primary Creditor.

238


-----

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement (including those set out in more detail below), each of the Secured Parties, the Debtors and Third Party
Security Providers waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the Transaction Security be enforced in
any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from any person,
or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the Transaction Security or of any other security interest, which is
capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the Secured Obligations, is so applied.

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties, the Debtors, and the Third Party
Security Providers acknowledges that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce,
the Transaction Security prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date or the Senior Unsecured Shared Security (as
the case may be), the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to any the Second Lien
Creditors or the Senior Unsecured Creditors (as applicable) in respect of the method, type and timing of that
enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that transaction security shall (save as set
out under “—Second Lien and Senior Unsecured Debt Protection”) be no different to or greater than the duty that
is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors and Third Party Security Providers under
general law. The Security Agent and any receiver or delegate shall not owe any duty of care to the Senior
Unsecured Creditors in respect of the method, type and timing of the enforcement or of the exploitation,
management or realization of any Transaction Security other than the Senior Unsecured Shared Security.

_Enforcement of Senior Unsecured Only Security_

The Senior Unsecured Creditors shall not give instructions to the Security Agent as to the enforcement
of the Senior Unsecured Only Security other than in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security
Agent may refrain from enforcing the Senior Unsecured Only Security or taking any other Enforcement Action
in respect of the Senior Unsecured Liabilities unless instructed otherwise by the Majority Senior Unsecured
Creditors.

Subject to the Senior Unsecured Only Security having become enforceable, the Senior Unsecured
Representative(s) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors) may give or refrain from
giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Senior Unsecured Only Security
as it sees fit.

No Senior Unsecured Finance Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to,
any Senior Unsecured Only Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the documents relating to
the Senior Unsecured Only Security except through the Security Agent.

If the Senior Unsecured Only Security is being enforced or other action as to enforcement with respect
thereto is being taken pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent shall enforce the
Senior Unsecured Only Security or take such other action as to enforcement in respect thereof in such manner
(including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator (or any analogous officer in any jurisdiction) of
any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors instruct or, in the
absence of such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit.

Each of the Senior Creditors and the Debtors acknowledges in the Intercreditor Agreement that, in the
event that the Security Agent enforces or is instructed to enforce the Senior Unsecured Only Security prior to the
Senior Unsecured Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to any
Senior Unsecured Finance Party in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the
exploitation, management or realization of any of that Senior Unsecured Only Security shall be no different to or
greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under general law,
save as set out under the fourth paragraph under “—Distressed Disposals”.

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
each of the Senior Creditors and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the Senior
Unsecured Only Security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time or that any sum
received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the Senior Unsecured Only
Security or of any other security interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the
Senior Liabilities which benefit from Senior Unsecured Only Security is so applied.

239


-----

After the Security Agent has commenced an Enforcement of the Senior Unsecured Only Security it shall
not accept any subsequent instructions as to Enforcement thereof from anyone other than the Majority Senior
Unsecured Creditors that instructed it in respect of such Enforcement regarding any other Enforcement over or
relating to the Senior Unsecured Only Security the subject of the Enforcement which has been commenced. This
will not restrict the right of any other Senior Unsecured Creditors to instruct the Security Agent as to Enforcement
of the Senior Unsecured Only Security that includes any shares or assets which are not directly or indirectly the
subject of a prior instruction as to Enforcement.

_Senior Unsecured Only Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security (other than any Senior Unsecured Only Security) is held by a Secured Party
other than the Security Agent, then such Secured Party may only enforce that Transaction Security in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement but otherwise the Secured Parties shall not have any independent powers to
enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Transaction Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion
arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

If any Senior Unsecured Only Security is held by a creditor other than the Security Agent, then such
creditors may only enforce that Senior Unsecured Only Security in accordance with instructions given by the
Senior Unsecured Representative(s) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors) in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement but otherwise the creditor shall not have any independent powers to
enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Senior Unsecured Only Security or to exercise any right, power, authority
or discretion arising under the Senior Unsecured Only Security except through the Security Agent.

shall override any requirement for application of such proceeds in any debt documents and no default or event of
default shall be deemed to occur to the extent arising from compliance with this provision.

_Distressed Disposals_

A “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset or shares of a Parent Group Company which is (i) being
effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become
enforceable, (ii) being effected by enforcement of the Transaction Security or (iii) the subject of Transaction
Security and which is being effected, subsequent to an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction
Security, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person which is not a Parent Group Company.

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, if a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being
effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security
Provider or the Company and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor
or other Secured Party, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor):

    - to release the Transaction Security and/or any other claim over that asset subject to the Distressed
Disposal or Appropriation (as defined below) and execute and deliver or enter into any release of
that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge
or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary
or desirable;

    - if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or Appropriation consists of shares in the capital of a
Debtor, to release:

      - that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its
guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

Provider over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Debtors and Third Party Security Providers;

- if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or Appropriation consists of shares in the capital of
any holding company of a Debtor, to release:

  - that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;

  - any transaction security granted by the holding company of that holding company over the
shares being disposed of or granted by that holding company being disposed of or any subsidiary
of that holding company over any of its assets; and

  - any other claim of an Intra-Group Lender, an Investor or another Debtor or a Third Party
Security Provider over the assets of that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding
company,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Debtors and Third Party Security Providers;

- if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or Appropriation consists of shares in the capital of a
Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the Liabilities or the liabilities owed
to any other Debtor (the “Debtor Liabilities”) by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary
of that Debtor or holding company:

  - (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the second to last paragraph under “—Second
_Lien and Senior Unsecured Debt Protection”) does not intend that any transferee of those_
Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter
into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on behalf
of the relevant Creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors, provided that,
notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document, the Transferee shall not be treated
as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

  - (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the second to last paragraph under “—Second
_Lien and Senior Unsecured Debt Protection”) does intend that any Transferee will be treated as_
a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the
Liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and all or part of any other Liabilities and the Debtor
Liabilities, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors, Debtors and Third Party Security
Providers; and

- if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or Appropriation consists of shares in the capital of a
Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting
in accordance with the first paragraph under “—Second Lien and Senior Unsecured Debt
_Protection”) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the_
Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect
of the Intra-Group Liabilities or the Debtor Liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to:

  - agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities
or Debtor Liabilities on behalf of the relevant Intra-Group Lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

  - (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities and Senior Unsecured

242


-----

Liabilities) accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group
Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which
the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of rights in respect
of Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities pursuant to the fourth bullet point above) shall be paid to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” as if those proceeds
were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of rights in
respect of Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities pursuant to the fourth bullet point above or an appropriation of secured
shares has occurred, as if that disposal of rights in respect of Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities or any reduction of
the secured obligations resulting from that appropriation had not occurred.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities or any Second Lien Liabilities
or Second Lien Creditor would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured
Creditor or Second Lien Creditor (as applicable) concerned may (to the extent legally possible) elect to have those
borrowing liabilities transferred to the Parent or an immediate Holding Company of the Parent (provided that, in
the case of a transfer to the Parent, it will remain a subsidiary of the company that was its immediate holding
company prior to the relevant Distressed Disposal), in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at
the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation
from any creditor subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to
so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

_Second Lien and Senior Unsecured Debt Protection_

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal or transfer of Liabilities as described above under the
fourth and fifth bullet points under “—Distressed Disposals”) effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent,
the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market value having regard to the prevailing market
conditions (though the Security Agent shall have no obligation to postpone (or request the postponement of) any
Distressed Disposal or disposal or transfer of Liabilities in order to achieve a higher value).

If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date or on or after the first date of incurrence of Senior Unsecured
Liabilities (but prior to the Senior Unsecured Discharge Date), unless the Second Lien Representative on behalf
of the Second Lien Creditors and/or the Senior Unsecured Representative on behalf of the Senior Unsecured
Creditors (as applicable) agree otherwise, any Distressed Disposal, any appropriation (or similar process) of the
shares in the capital of a Group Company by the Security Agent (or a receiver or delegate) which is effected by
enforcement of the transaction security (an “Appropriation”), or disposal or transfer of Liabilities which results
in the release of any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities in respect of Second Lien Liabilities or Senior
Unsecured Liabilities or the release of any transaction security securing the Second Lien Liabilities or the Senior
Unsecured Liabilities may, in each case, only be made if (and the requirement under the above paragraph shall be
satisfied (and as between the Creditors, the Third Party Security Providers and the Debtors shall be conclusively
presumed to be satisfied) and the Security Agent will be taken to have discharged all its obligations in this respect
under the Intercreditor Agreement, the other debt documents and generally at law only if):

    - the consideration in respect of such Distressed Disposal, Appropriation or disposal or transfer of
Liabilities is paid or payable in cash (or substantially all in cash); or

    - the consideration in respect of such Distressed Disposal, Appropriation or disposal or transfer of
Liabilities does not comprise cash (or substantially all cash) in circumstances where the Security
Agent (acting reasonably) determines that the cash consideration payable under each of the other
bona fide and fully committed offers made in relation to that Distressed Disposal or disposal or
transfer of Liabilities is less than the par value of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Senior
Secured Liabilities, in which case the non-cash consideration can, without limitation, take the form
of the Senior Secured Creditors (or any of them acting alone or together) bidding by any appropriate
mechanic all or part of their Senior Secured Liabilities (such that the Senior Secured Liabilities
would, on completion, be discharged in full to the extent of an amount equal to the amount of the
offer made by the relevant Senior Secured Creditors),

and the proceeds of such Distressed Disposal or disposal of Liabilities are applied in accordance with the
provisions under “—Application of Proceeds”;

-----

- the Distressed Disposal, Appropriation or disposal or transfer of Liabilities is made pursuant to a
Competitive Process or any other process agreed to by the Second Lien Representative on behalf of
the Second Lien Creditors and (to the extent that guarantee liabilities owed to the Senior Unsecured
Creditors have been, or are proposed to be, released by the Security Agent in connection with the
relevant Distressed Disposal or disposal of Liabilities) the Senior Unsecured Representative on
behalf of the Senior Unsecured Creditors in each case in which:

  - the Second Lien Creditors and the Senior Unsecured Creditors; and

  - if such auction or process attracts, or could reasonably be expected to result in attracting, either
no bidders or a bona fide and fully committed cash bid the cash consideration in relation to
which is determined by the Security Agent (acting reasonably) to be less than the par value of
the aggregate outstanding amount of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Senior Secured
Creditors (or any of them acting alone or together), are (subject to applicable law) entitled to
participate (which foregoing expression shall have the meaning given to it in the definition of
“Competitive Process” below) as bidders or financiers to the potential purchaser or, following
the Distressed Disposal, Appropriation or disposal or transfer of Liabilities, financiers to the
Group; and

  - the Security Agent (or the relevant Parent Group Company) shall have, in respect of such public
auction or other competitive sale process (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a private
auction in which multiple bidders participate or are invited to participate) conducted and run in
accordance with the advice of a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent in respect of
which the holders of any secured obligations are entitled to participate, which auction or process
may be (but does not have to be) completed by a process or proceedings approved by or
supervised by, or on behalf of, any court of law (a “Competitive Process”), consulted an
independent internationally recognised investment bank or an independent internationally
recognised firm of accountants or a reputable independent internationally recognised third party
professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations in respect of the relevant
type and size of the assets concerned (or, in the case of a Competitive Process, is regularly
engaged in such sale processes) (a “Financial Adviser”) selected by the Security Agent (acting
reasonably) with respect to the procedures which may reasonably be expected to be used to
obtain a fair market price in the then prevailing market conditions (taking into account all
relevant circumstances and with a view to facilitating a prompt and expeditious sale at a fair
market price in the prevailing market conditions although there shall be no obligation to
postpone any such sale in order to achieve a higher price), and shall have implemented (to the
extent permitted by law) in all material respects the procedures recommended by such Financial
Adviser in relation to such Competitive Process, unless the Security Agent has received an
opinion of the type referred to in the paragraph below in respect of such Competitive Process;
or

- where either (x) the Security Agent (acting in good faith) considers that it is not reasonably
practicable for the Distressed Disposal, Appropriation or disposal or transfer of Liabilities to be
made pursuant to a Competitive Process, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances or (y)
following an attempted Distressed Disposal, Appropriation or disposal or transfer of Liabilities
pursuant to a Competitive Process in circumstances where the Senior Secured Creditors make the
highest final binding offer of all the offers received pursuant to such Competitive Process but that
offer is less than the par value of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Senior Secured Liabilities,
the Security Agent has received an opinion from a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent
confirming that the price of the Distressed Disposal, Appropriation or disposal or transfer of
Liabilities is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances
although there shall be no obligation to postpone any Distressed Disposal, Appropriation or disposal
or transfer of Liabilities in order to achieve a higher price and which opinion shall include an
enterprise valuation of the Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to
the Agents of the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Senior Unsecured
Creditors and which may be given on the basis that the liability of the Financial Adviser giving the
opinion may be limited to an amount not less than the aggregate amount of the fees payable to it in
respect of such engagement; and

-----

    - at the time of completion of the Distressed Disposal, Appropriation or disposal or transfer of
Liabilities, (i) the borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and (to the extent permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second
Lien Creditors and the Senior Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors being disposed of (each a
“Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent) released and discharged (and are not assumed by the
purchaser and/or its Affiliates) and (ii) all the transaction security granted in favor of all the Secured
Parties over the assets sold or disposed of is released and discharged unless:

      - the Agent of the Senior Secured Creditors, acting reasonably and in good faith, determines that
a sale, disposal or transfer of a Relevant Claim will facilitate a recovery by the Senior Secured
Creditors that is greater than the one they would achieve if such Relevant Claim was released
or discharged but is nevertheless less than the par value of the aggregate outstanding amount of
the Senior Secured Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if
the Agent of the Senior Secured Creditors (acting reasonably) determines that there are no bona
_fide_ and fully committed cash bids in excess of the par value of the aggregate outstanding
amount of the Senior Secured Liabilities; and

      - the Agent of the Senior Secured Creditors give notice of their determination to the Security
Agent,

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer the Relevant Claims
to such purchaser (or an Affiliate of such purchaser) (or, if the second bullet point above applies and a Senior
Secured Creditor is the successful bidder (or financier) or beneficiary of the relevant disposal as contemplated in
the second bullet point above, such Senior Secured Creditor shall be able to retain its Relevant Claim or any part
thereof (which shall be valued at par)).

If, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal or a disposal of rights in respect of
Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities pursuant to the provisions set out under “—Distressed Disposals” above is being
effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors or the Majority Senior Unsecured Creditors are
entitled to give, and have given, instructions in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Enforcement
_instructions” and/or “—Manner of Enforcement” above on which the Security Agent is acting:_

    - the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any
borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities or other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor
unless those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities and any other Senior
Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent Liability relating
to a letter of credit or an ancillary facility issued under the Revolving Credit Facility or an Operating
Facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Secured
Creditor), following that release; and

    - no Distressed Disposal or disposal of rights in respect of Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities pursuant to
the provisions set out under “—Distressed Disposals” above may be made for non-cash
consideration unless the prior consent of the Instructing Group is obtained.

For the purposes of the provisions set out under “—Distressed Disposals” and “—Second Lien and
_Senior Unsecured Debt” above, the Security Agent shall act:_

    - if the relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the security in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Manner of Enforcement” above; and

    - in any other case, (i) on the instructions of the Instructing Group or (ii) in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit.

Each Creditor, Debtor and Third Party Security Provider is required to do all things that the Security
Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to the above provisions.

any Transaction Security or guarantee and/or indemnity provided to any Creditor pursuant to the

not to be a Secured Party under any Transaction Security Document and shall not benefit from the
guarantee or indemnity.

_Equalization of the Super Senior Secured Creditors/Senior Secured Creditors_

If the enforcement date occurs and:

    - if, for any reason, any Senior Secured Liabilities remain unpaid after the enforcement date and the
resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors)
in the proportions which their respective Exposures at the enforcement date bore to the aggregate
Exposures of all the Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) at the
enforcement date, the Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) will make
such payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the Senior Secured
Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) in such a position that (after taking into account
such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions provided that no Senior Secured Creditor
shall be obliged to make any payment under the equalization provision in respect of any amount
received by it from a person who is not a Group Company or Third Party Security Provider; and

    - if, for any reason, any Super Senior Liabilities remain unpaid after the enforcement date and the
resulting losses are not borne by the Super Senior Creditors in the proportions which their respective
exposures at the enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the Super Senior Creditors
at the enforcement date, the Super Senior Creditors will make such payments amongst themselves
as the Security Agent shall require to put the Super Senior Creditors in such a position that (after
taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions provided that no
Super Senior Creditor shall be obliged to make any payment under the equalization provision in
respect of any amount received by it from a person who is not a Group Company or Third Party
Security Provider.

_Equalization of the Second Lien Creditors_

If, for any reason, any Second Lien Liabilities remain unpaid after the enforcement date and the resulting
losses are not borne by the Second Lien Creditors in the proportions which their respective exposures at the
enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the Second Lien Creditors at the enforcement date, the
Second Lien Creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put
the Second Lien Creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne
in those proportions provided that no Second Lien Creditor shall be obliged to make any payment under the
equalization provision in respect of any amount received by it from a person who is not a Group Company or
Third Party Security Provider.

_Equalization of the Senior Unsecured Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if for any reason, any Senior Unsecured Liabilities remain
unpaid after the enforcement date and the resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Unsecured Creditors in the

248


-----

proportions which their respective exposures at the enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the
Senior Unsecured Creditors at the enforcement date, the Senior Unsecured Creditors will make such payments
amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the Senior Unsecured Creditors in such a position
that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions, provided that no Senior
Unsecured Creditor shall be obliged to make any payment in respect of (i) any amount received by it from a person
who is not a Parent Group Company or (ii) the proceeds of any Enforcement Action taken by it with respect to
any Senior Unsecured Only Security.

**_Refinancing of Certain Liabilities_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for the borrowing, incurrence, refinancing, restructuring,
replacement, increase, exchange or discharge of the Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities, the Second Lien
Liabilities and the Senior Unsecured Liabilities in whole or in part. In connection with any new liabilities to rank
in the manner contemplated in the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the refinancing or replacement of the Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Senior Unsecured Liabilities that requires the
release of any security by the Security Agent and any consent required under the Senior Finance Documents, the
Super Senior Finance Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Finance Documents, the Second Lien Finance
Documents or the Senior Unsecured Finance Documents, as applicable, in respect of such release of security has
been obtained, the Security Agent shall release (and the relevant secured parties expressly authorize the Security
Agent to release on their behalf, to the extent necessary) such security which has been granted to it provided that
such release occurs on the date of such borrowing, incurrence, refinancing, restructuring, replacement, increase,
exchange or discharge and is within the terms of such consent (if any).

Each of the creditors subject to the Intercreditor Agreement has authorized their relevant representative
to enter into such agreements with the Debtors and/or the holders of the new Liabilities and/or their agents and
trustees, whether by way of supplement, amendment or restatement of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
or by a separate deed, as may be necessary to give effect to the terms described in the preceding paragraph. Any
such amendment shall not require the consent of any such creditor and shall be effective and binding on all parties
to the Intercreditor Agreement upon the execution thereof by the Debtors, the Third Party Security Providers, each
Second Lien Representative, each Senior Unsecured Representative, each Senior Secured Notes Trustee, each
Senior Agent, each Super Senior Agent and the Security Agent. In certain circumstances, as more fully described
in the Intercreditor Agreement, the existing security granted to the relevant Secured Parties may be released,
and/or new security may be granted, in order to give effect to such provisions.

**_Group Pushdown_**

On or following or in contemplation of an initial public offering of a member of the Group (or a holding
company thereof) (an "IPO Event"), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is entitled to require (by written notice to
each Agent and Hedge Counterparty) (a "Pushdown Notice") that the terms of the Debt Documents will
automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the
member of the Group or holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer who will issue shares or whose
shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO Event (the "Pushdown Entity," and if (x) any Senior Unsecured Notes
are not refinanced in full on or before the effective date specified in the Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown Date”),
the Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer which is the issuer or
borrower of any Senior Unsecured Liabilities or (y) the Senior Unsecured Notes have been refinanced in full on
or before the Pushdown Date but the Senior Secured Notes have not, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be the
IPO Pushdown Entity) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding
any holding company of the Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the
Pushdown Entity, and (iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and
events of default) will cease to apply to any holding company of the Pushdown Entity. The Senior Secured Notes
Issuer is entitled to revoke its Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event. In
the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked each of the changes specified in (i) to (iii) (inclusive) above shall
no longer apply.

Each holding company of the Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security or, as the case may be, Senior Unsecured Only Security) and each
Investor, Third-Party Security Provider, or provider of Senior Unsecured Only Security (as defined in the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement or any other Finance Document) will be released from its obligations and restrictions
under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity. In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
revokes its Pushdown Notice, the relevant member of the Group is required (if instructed by an Instructing Group

249


-----

to (x) execute replacement Transaction Security or Senior Unsecured Only Security and (y) (by way of accession)
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the Majority Senior Lenders, the Majority Super Senior Lenders, the majority
of the Senior Secured Noteholders, the Majority Second Lien Lenders, the relevant majority of Second Lien
Noteholders, the Majority Senior Unsecured Lenders and the relevant majority of Senior Unsecured Noteholder
(in such percentages pro rata to their participations in the applicable Debt Documents to the extent continuing and
as applicable for the purposes of those definitions at such time), each subsidiary of the Pushdown Entity shall also
be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction
Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be
required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such
matters.

**_Required Consents_**

only with the consent of the Company, the Majority Super Senior Lenders, the relevant Senior Agent(s), the
Second Lien Representative(s), the relevant Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s), the relevant Senior Unsecured
Representative(s) and the Security Agent provided that any term of the Intercreditor Agreement may be amended
or waived by the Company and the Security Agent without the consent of any other party if that amendment or
waiver is solely to cure defects or omissions, resolve ambiguities or reflect changes of a minor, technical or
administrative nature.

Other than in respect of the implementation of a Structural Adjustment under (and as defined in) the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or any substantially similar transaction contemplated by an equivalent
definition thereto in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement to the extent it does not confer an ability to make more
extensive changes than a Structural Adjustment, an amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has
the effect of changing or which relates to, among other things, the provisions set out under “—Application of
_Proceeds” and the order of priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without_
the consent of:

    - the Agents;

    - the Senior Lenders;

    - the Super Senior Lenders;

    - the Senior Secured Noteholders (to the extent that the amendment or waiver would materially and
adversely affect such creditors);

adversely affect such creditors);

    - the Senior Unsecured Creditors (to the extent that the amendment or waiver would materially and
adversely affect such creditors);

Hedge Counterparty);

    - the Security Agent; and

    - the Company.

The Senior Secured Notes Trustee(s), the Second Lien Notes Trustee(s) and the Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee(s) shall, to the extent consented to by the requisite percentage of noteholders in accordance with the

250


-----

amendments that relate to any provision affecting the rights and obligations of a notes trustee in its capacity as
such.

_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_

Subject to the paragraph below and to certain other exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement and
unless the provisions of any debt document expressly provide otherwise, the Security Agent may, if authorized
by an Instructing Group, and if the Company consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of or
grant consents under, any of the Transaction Security Documents which shall be binding on each party.

The Security Agent may, if the Company consents, amend or release and retake any Transaction Security
Document where such amendment or release and retake is required or desirable in order to ensure the validity,
perfection or priority of the Transaction Security purported to be created under such Transaction Security
Document, together with any related or consequential waiver (including by reason of a failure to register such
Transaction Security Document with Companies House within the prescribed time limit set out in the Companies
Act 2006, in which case any payment or other obligation or default arising out of such failure to register shall also
be automatically and irrevocably waived) and any such amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be binding
on each party.

Subject to the second and third paragraphs under “—Exceptions” below, the prior consent of each Senior
Agent, each Super Senior Agent, Operating Facility Provider, Senior Secured Notes Trustee, Second Lien
Representative and, in respect of the Senior Unsecured Shared Security only, Senior Unsecured Representative
(in each case, acting with the consent of the requisite percentage of creditors under the relevant debt documents)
and the Company is required to authorize any release of the security or any amendment or waiver of, or consent
under, any relevant transaction security document which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the charged
property or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the security are distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the two paragraphs immediately below, if the amendment, waiver or consent may impose new
or additional obligations on, or withdraw or reduce the rights of, any party other than:

    - in the case of a Primary Creditor (other than an Agent or Arranger), in a way which affects, or would
affect, Primary Creditors of that party’s class generally; or

    - in the case of a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider, to the extent consented to by the Company
under the Intercreditor Agreement,

the consent of that party is required.

Subject to the two paragraphs immediately below, an amendment, waiver, consent or release which
relates to the rights or obligations of an Agent, an Arranger, the Security Agent (including, without limitation, any
ability of the Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement), an Operating Facility
Provider or a Hedge Counterparty may not be effected without the consent of that Agent or, as the case may be,
Arranger, the Security Agent, that Operating Facility Provider or that Hedge Counterparty.

Neither of the two immediately preceding paragraphs shall apply:

    - to any release of Transaction Security, Senior Unsecured Only Security, claim or Liabilities; or

    - to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

The above paragraphs shall only apply to an Arranger to the extent that Arranger Liabilities are then
owed to that Arranger.

**_Snooze/Lose_**

If in relation to a request for a consent, a request to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, a request
to approve any action or a request for a confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Senior Lender or Super Senior Lender or Operating Facility Provider or Second Lien Lender or

251


-----

Senior Unsecured Lender fails to respond to the request within 10 business days or fails to provide details of its
credit participation within the timescale specified by the Security Agent, such Primary Creditor will be
disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation or outstandings in respect of the matter or be deemed to have
provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable.

**_Agreement to Override_**

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides
anything in the Debt Documents to the contrary.

**_Other Provisions_**

The Intercreditor Agreement contains further provisions customary for documents of this nature, dealing
with among other things:

    - close-out and enforcement (and other enforcement) rights for the Hedge Counterparties, certain
required close-out obligations and the terms on which the Hedging Agreements must be entered into
(and may be amended in the future) and on which payments may be made under such hedging
agreements and security and guarantees (and similar rights) may be granted in respect thereof;

    - restrictions on amendments to the terms of any Intra-Group Liabilities, Holdco Liabilities and
Investor Liabilities, restrictions on payments thereunder and the granting of security and guarantees
(and similar rights) in respect thereof, restrictions on the taking of enforcement action by the related
creditors, turnover obligations and similar customary provisions; for the avoidance of doubt, the
Intercreditor Agreement will not prevent payments with respect to such Liabilities which are
permitted by the terms of the underlying debt documents;

    - information sharing between creditor groups;

    - customary protections and related provisions for notes trustees and the Security Agent (who is
appointed to act in such capacity under the Intercreditor Agreement); and

    - customary provisions regarding assignments and transfers, and accession of future creditors and
Debtors.

Until the relevant proceeds are released from escrow, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement shall not apply
to, or create any restriction in respect of, any escrow arrangement to which the proceeds of any Senior Secured
Notes, Senior Lender Liabilities, Second Lien Notes, Second Lien Loan Liabilities, Senior Unsecured Notes
and/or Senior Unsecured Loan Liabilities are subject and the Intercreditor Agreement shall not govern the rights
and obligations of the relevant Creditor(s) in respect thereof until such proceeds are released from such escrow
arrangements in accordance with the terms thereof.

To the extent that any step or action is expressly permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, the parties
to the Intercreditor Agreement agree that such step or action will be permitted under the other debt documents
and if there is a conflict between the terms of, or the requirement for any conditions in, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any other debt documents, the terms of, or the requirement for any conditions in, the Intercreditor Agreement
will prevail (subject to certain exceptions), in each case notwithstanding any restriction or prohibition to the
contrary.

**_Governing Law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement (and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with
it) are governed by English law.

**Factoring**

The Issuer is party to certain non-recourse agreements with factoring counterparties pursuant to which
we make sales of trade receivables to such counterparties. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Off Balance Sheet Arrangements—Factoring.”_

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

Limacorporate S.p.A. (the “Issuer”) will issue €295.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured
Floating Rate Notes due 2028. The Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated as of February 3, 2023
(the “Indenture”), between the Issuer, GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and GLAS
Specialist Services Limited as legal representative of the holders of the Notes (mandatario con rappresentanza)
under the Indenture and common representative (rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to
articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code, GLAS Trust Company LLC, as paying agent and transfer agent
(the “Transfer Agent”) and registrar (the “Registrar”) and GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as security agent
and representative (rappresentante) pursuant to article 2414-bis, 3rd paragraph of the Italian Civil Code (the
“Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate, include, by reference or otherwise, or be subject to
the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

Certain terms used in this “Description of the Notes” are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.”
In this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Issuer,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer only to the Issuer and
any successor obligor to the Issuer in respect of the Notes, and not to any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative
priority of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for
undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security
and Guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other
remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to
certain transfer restrictions.

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture.
However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the
Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any future
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not
Guarantee the Notes.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, but this issuance of Notes is limited to €295.0
million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Issuer may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional
Notes under the Indenture subject to the procedures and limitations described therein (as described below under
“—Additional Notes”).

The Issuer is a direct subsidiary of Emil Holding II S.à r.l. (“Holdco”). Certain of the operations of the Issuer will
be conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer will, in part, depend on the cash flow of these
Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Under applicable local regulations,
cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries of the Issuer can only be upstreamed to their direct or indirect
parent entities, including to the Issuer for purposes of servicing the Notes, to the extent that sufficient profits
available for distribution exist within these legal entities and that they continue to meet relevant minimum
regulatory capital requirements, as applicable. The Notes will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to
all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that
are not Guarantors.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We
urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they,
and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Notes.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

253


-----

- rank _pari passu_ in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including the obligations of the Issuer under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, if any);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation;

- be Guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior basis as described under “—Note Guarantees”;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are
not Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade creditors;

- mature on February 1, 2028; and

- be represented by one or more registered notes in global registered form, but in certain circumstances may be
represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”).

Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral only after certain obligations entitled to receive proceeds from the enforcement of
the Collateral in priority to the Notes have been repaid in full, including obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture, if any.

**_The Note Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. We will within 90 days of the Issue Date procure that Lima
Orthopaedics Australia Pty Ltd, LIMA Deutschland GmbH, Lima USA Inc., Lima Orthopaedics New Zealand
Limited, Lima Implantes, S.L.U., Lima France S.A.S., Lima Netherlands B.V. and Lima Orthopaedics UK
Limited accede to the Indenture as Guarantors (the “Initial Guarantors”). Each of the Initial Guarantors will also
be obligors under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees,” subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed_
Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future (the
“Additional Guarantors” and, together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). The Note Guarantees
will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

- be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee (including that Guarantor’s
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, if any);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is
secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such other Indebtedness or obligation; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that
are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial
assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention
of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things,
might limit the amount that can be Guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant

254


-----

Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law requirements being
complied with. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles
which apply to and restrict the granting of Guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility and the Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory
or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate to the
benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable Guarantee. For a description of the
Agreed Security Principles, see “Security—The Collateral” below. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes,
or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to our Indebtedness and the Notes,” “ Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the_
_Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—_
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, the Issuer and the Initial Guarantors in aggregate represented
82.5% of our Adjusted EBITDA.

Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt
and Guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those
Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of those Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have
priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the
Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be
structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries (if any). Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries (including non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is
subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the
Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.” As of September
30, 2022, after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries would have had €0.1
million of indebtedness.

_Note Guarantees Release_

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally terminated and released without
any action by the Trustee or Security Agent, as the case may be, or the Holders of the Notes under any one or
more of the following circumstances:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the
sale or other disposition;

(2) upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all the
assets of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), if the sale
or other disposition does not violate the Indenture;

(3) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the relevant Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(4) upon payment in full of all principal, interest and other obligations in respect of the Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(5) upon the release of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to Guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Additional Guarantees”; provided that no other Indebtedness is at that time guaranteed by_
the Guarantor that would result in the requirement that the Guarantor provide a Note Guarantee pursuant
to the same covenant;

(6) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

255


-----

(7) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(8) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

(9) with respect to an entity that is not the successor Guarantor, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—
_Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Guarantors”; or_

(10) with respect to any Guarantor that is an Immaterial Subsidiary, upon written notice from the Issuer to the
Trustee so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor
(i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Revolving Credit
Facility and (ii) does not Guarantee (a) any Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending
commitments in excess of €50.0 million at the relevant date of determination or (b) Public Debt.

The Trustee shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested in writing by the Issuer, including the granting
of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate
any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and
indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of or
liability to the Holders.

The Indenture will provide that any release of a Note Guarantee shall, at the option of the Issuer, be evidenced by
the delivery by the Issuer to the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer, and that, at the option of the
Issuer, the Trustee (and, if requested, the Security Agent) shall acknowledge and confirm such release upon
delivery of such Officer’s Certificate.

**_Security_**

**_The Collateral_**

On or about the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be secured on a first-priority
basis by first-priority security interests over:

     - the entire share capital of the Issuer;

     - material bank accounts of the Issuer;

     - material intercompany loan receivables (if any) owed by the Issuer to Holdco; and

     - material intercompany loan receivables (if any) owed by each Guarantor to the Issuer (collectively,
the “Issue Date Collateral”).

Within 90 days of the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be secured on a firstpriority basis by first-priority security interests over:

     - the shares owned by the Issuer or any Guarantor over each Guarantor;

     - material intercompany loan receivables (if any) owed by each Guarantor to the Issuer or any Obligor;

     - all the assets of Lima Orthopaedics UK Limited other than certain excluded property; and

     - all the assets of Lima USA Inc. other than certain excluded property (collectively, the “Post-Closing
**Collateral”).**

The Issue Date Collateral, the Post-Closing Collateral and any other assets from time to time subsequent to the
Issue Date in which a security interest has been or will be granted pursuant to any Security Document to secure
the obligations under the Indenture or the Notes or any Note Guarantee, in each case as may be in existence from
time to time, the “Collateral,” in each case only from the point at which Liens in respect of the Collateral are
granted in respect of the Notes only until such Liens are discharged or released; provided that any property or
asset of a Guarantor subject only to a floating charge (and not any other Lien) under any Security Document to
the extent such charge has not crystallized into a fixed charge shall not be deemed Collateral for purposes of
determining whether a Permitted Lien is permitted over such asset or property on a fixed basis pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”; _provided further that nothing in the_

256


-----

Indenture shall prohibit such property or asset being released from such floating charge to the extent a Permitted
Lien is granted if such release is required by the grantee of such floating charge and provided that such assets and
property are not Collateral which are subject to a fixed charge in favor of the Holders.

The Agreed Security Principles embody recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and practical
difficulties in obtaining guarantees and security from the Issuer, any Third Party Security Providers (as defined
in the Intercreditor Agreement) and Guarantors in every jurisdiction in which the Issuer, the Third Party Security
Providers and the Guarantors are located. In particular, notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described
below under “—Certain _Covenants—Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any_
pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles, including (but not limited to) if:

- providing such security or guarantee would be prohibited by general mandatory legal and statutory
limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance (including, without limitation, pursuant to articles
2358 or 2474 of the Italian Civil Code), corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “controlled foreign
corporation”, “transfer pricing” or “thin capitalization rules”, capital maintenance, retention of title
claims, exchange control restrictions, minority shareholder protection/equal treatment of shareholder
rules and similar principles; _provided that the Issuer, shall use reasonable endeavors to assist in_
demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to the Issuer or the relevant Third Party Security
Provider or Guarantor and to overcome any such limitation to the extent reasonably practicable;

- providing such security or guarantee would require the consent of any supervisory board, employee or
works council (or equivalent), pensions trustee, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), minority
shareholder or other external body unless such consent has been received; _provided that reasonable_
endeavors (taking into account any adverse impact on relationships with third parties) have been used by
the Issuer or the relevant Third Party Security Provider or Guarantor, as applicable, to obtain the relevant
consent;

- (subject to certain exceptions) the time and cost of providing such security or guarantee (including
adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, notarial costs and registration taxes, such as
the Imposta Sostitutiva regime in Italy) is disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders;

- the assets are subject to third-party arrangements which may prevent those assets from being secured (or
are assets which, if secured, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights,
benefits and/or obligations of any of Holdco, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of those assets
or require such entity to take any action materially adverse to the interests of Holdco, the Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries); provided that reasonable endeavors to obtain consent to charging or assigning any
such assets shall be used by Holdco, the Issuer or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in certain circumstances
if the relevant asset is material and the Issuer determines in good faith that such endeavours will not
involve placing commercial relationships with third parties in jeopardy, seeking consent from creditors
or incurring any material cost; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no security shall be required
over (and no consent request submitted with respect to) assets which are required to support Acquired
Indebtedness to the extent permitted or not prohibited;

- providing such security or guarantee would conflict with the mandatory fiduciary duties of the directors
of Holdco, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their affiliates or contravene any legal prohibition
or have the potential to result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any director or
officer; provided that Holdco, the Issuer or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, shall use reasonable
endeavors to overcome any such obstacle to the extent it can be done at reasonable cost; or

- the assets are not legally and beneficially owned by the Parent, the relevant Third Party Security Provider
or the Issuer or Guarantor (as applicable) or which are not located in a jurisdiction in which any Guarantor
is incorporated or are assets of any joint venture, similar arrangement or any minority interest or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is not wholly owned by another Restricted Subsidiary.

The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to fraudulent
conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise
to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations
of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations applicable
to security providers and their shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such contractual

257


-----

limitations, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The Collateral has been or will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of
the holders of the secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral, including, on a first-priority basis, the
Holders of the Notes, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the counterparties under
certain Hedging Obligations, if any. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “Certain Covenants—Liens,” the
Issuer is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness or
Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Notes, and the Collateral securing the Notes may
be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes and the disposition
of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. No appraisals of the Collateral have been
made in connection with this issuance of Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and
may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short
period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—The Notes and
_the Guarantees will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as Collateral.”_

_Priority_

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security **_Interests” and each, a “Security_** **_Interest”) as between (a) the Trustee, the Security_**
Agent and the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture, (b) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, (c) the
counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any and (d) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness
permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
which will provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging
Obligations and the Notes are secured equally and ratably by first-priority Security Interests; however, under the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Notes will only receive proceeds from the enforcement
of the Collateral after certain obligations including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) certain
priority Hedging Obligations, if any, and (iii) certain future Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture, if any,
have been paid in full. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements
entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “Description _of_
_Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement,” “—Release_ _of_ _Liens,” “—Certain_ _Covenants—No_
_Impairment_ _of_ _Security_ _Interest,” “—Certain_ _Definitions—Permitted_ _Collateral_ _Liens” and “Risk Factors— Risks_
_Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and_
_counterparties to certain hedging obligations, if any, are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral_
_sold in any enforcement procedure in priority to the Notes.”_

_Security Documents_

Under the Security Documents, Holdco, the Issuer and the other Guarantors have granted, or will grant, subject
to the Agreed Security Principles, security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and
the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security
Documents will be entered into by, among others, (i) the relevant security provider, (ii) the Security Agent for
itself and as agent on behalf of the secured parties, (and, with respect to the Security Documents governed by
Italian law, the Security Agent also as Security Representative and legal representative (mandatario con
_rappresentanza) and (iv) with respect to the Security Documents governed by Italian law, GLAS Specialist_
Services Limited as Noteholders’ Representative and the Trustee acting for itself and in its capacity as the Trustee
under the Indenture. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, in relation
to the Security Interests in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only
the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) will have the right to enforce the Security
Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. The Security Documents will provide that the
rights under the Security Documents must be exercised by the Security Agent (including, in the case of Security
Documents governed by Italian law, in its role as Security Representative). As a consequence of such contractual
provisions and because the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee
under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security

258


-----

Agent in respect of the enforcement of the Collateral. See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—_
_Intercreditor_ _Agreement” and Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes.”_

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by the Security Interests until all
obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security
Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided
under “—Release _of_ _Liens.”_

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security
Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor
Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under
the Security Documents.

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, Holdco, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in possession and
retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the property and assets constituting
Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including any and all dividends,
distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of Capital Stock of the Guarantors that is part of
the Collateral).

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Holders of Notes, the counterparties to certain Hedging
Obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be
deemed to have, appointed, also for the purposes of Article 1704 (mandato con rappresentanza) of the Italian
Civil Code, the Security Agent to act as its agent and mandatario con rappresentanza under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents.
Furthermore, each Holder will have deemed to have appointed the Security Agent as _mandatario con_
_rappresentanza pursuant to article 1704 of the Italian Civil Code to act on its behalf and as representative_
(rappresentante) pursuant to article 2414-bis of the Italian Civil Code. The creditors under the Revolving Credit
Facility, the Holders of Notes, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral
and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent
under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (as applicable) to: (i) perform the duties and exercise the
rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security
documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents, together with any other incidental
rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment,
confirmation, extension, renewal, replacement or discharge expressed to be executed by the Security Agent in its
name and on its behalf.

_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_

The Indenture will provide that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and that the
Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the Holders of the Notes) to enter into
the Intercreditor Agreement and to give effect to its provisions.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and
perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents;

(3) agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of GLAS Specialist Services Limited as common
representative (rappresentante comune) of the Holders pursuant to articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian

The Liens on the Collateral will be automatically and unconditionally released without any action by the Trustee
or Security Agent, as the case may be, or the Holders of the Notes under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the shares of the Issuer) to a
Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) if such sale or other
disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture (with respect to_
the Liens on such Collateral);

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,

ceases to exist, the Lien on the shares of the Issuer or such Guarantor will be released and, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, will reattach (or a new Lien will be created) over the shares of the successor
entity pursuant to a new share pledge (on terms substantially equivalent to the existing Lien on the shares
of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable) granted by the holder of such shares;

(7) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral, or the
sale or transfer of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, in each case pursuant to a

least equivalent ranking over the same assets in a manner consistent with, and pursuant to applicable
formalities under, the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest”;_

(9) with respect to the Security Interests in respect of the Capital Stock of a Person or its Restricted
Subsidiary to be offered, within a reasonable time to facilitate an Initial Public Offering in which such
Person or its Restricted Subsidiary is the IPO Entity; provided that, such Security Interests so released

Stock is not sold or the Initial Public Offering does not complete for any reason; or

260


-----

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted
by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Indenture will provide that any release of a Lien on Collateral shall, at the option of the Issuer, be evidenced
by the delivery by the Issuer to the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer, and that, at the option of the
Issuer, the Trustee and Security Agent shall acknowledge and confirm such release upon delivery of such Officer’s
Certificate.

At the written request of the Issuer, the Security Agent and the Trustee (if required) will take all necessary action
reasonably required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the relevant Security Document, subject to customary protections and indemnification. Each of
the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders. The
Indenture will provide that any release of Collateral shall, at the option of the Issuer, be evidenced by the delivery
by the Issuer to the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer, and that, at the option of the Issuer, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall acknowledge and confirm such release upon delivery of such Officer’s Certificate.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €295,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes will
mature on February 1, 2028 at par. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to threemonth EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor), plus 5.75%, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation
**Agent”), which shall initially be GLAS Specialist Services Limited. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the**
Issue Date or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for and be payable in cash
quarterly in arrears on each February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2023; and be
payable to the Holder of record of such Notes on the Clearing System Business Day immediately preceding the
related interest payment date in accordance with, and subject to, the then applicable procedures of the Relevant
Clearing System, or to the extent Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below) have been issued, to the Holders
of record of the Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date. Interest will
be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the interest period. Each
interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest
on the Notes.

“Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR,” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits
in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page or Bloomberg equivalent as of 11:00 a.m.
London time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page or its Bloomberg equivalent does
not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London
office of each of four major banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such
bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m. London time, on
such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone interbank market for deposits in a Representative
Amount in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be
the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request
each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a
percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a
Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is
two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate
for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then
the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

261


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any Interest Period the rate determined based on the procedure specified in
this paragraph is less than 0.0%, EURIBOR shall mean 0.0% for purposes of determining the Applicable Rate for
such Interest Period.

In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no longer generally
accepted in the Euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated
securities, the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Notes will be any successor rate generally
accepted in the Euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated
securities, as identified by the Issuer in good faith; provided that, in the event that there is no generally accepted
successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Issuer, shall determine a reasonably
appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest (and any applicable adjustment spread to reduce
or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the
case may be) to Holders of the Notes as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR (the “Adjustment Spread”))
on the Notes; provided, further, that any such alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases
never be less than 0.0%. Following the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this paragraph, all references
to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative basis. The Issuer shall promptly
thereafter notify the Holders of the Notes and (by way of an Officer’s Certificate, delivered at least two Business
Days prior to the relevant Determination Date) the Calculation Agent of the new rate replacing EURIBOR, and
the Calculation Agent shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate (without further enquiry, investigation,
verification or liability of any kind whatsoever) as sufficient evidence thereof. Holders of the Notes shall be bound
by any such alternative basis (and the Adjustment Spread) without any further action or consent by the Holders
of the Notes or the Trustee; provided that if the Calculation Agent is unable (based on the information provided
by the Issuer with respect to such new rate or Adjustment Spread (if any)) to calculate, or calculate definitely, the
interest rate applicable to the Interest Period commencing immediately following notification thereof, then
EURIBOR in respect of such Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately
preceding Interest Period.

None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent shall be responsible or liable for any action or
inaction of the Issuer or its determination of such new rate. Nothing in the Indenture will require or oblige the
Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to agree to any amendment or modification in connection with such
new rate which may, in its opinion, expose the Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to any additional
liabilities or increase in its obligations or decrease in its rights or protections.

“Euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that have adopted the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the
first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude May 1, 2023.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single
transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as may
replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement
Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. London time on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following
Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable
Rate to the principal amount of each outstanding Note, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of
days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. The Calculation Agent will cause the rate of interest and
Interest Amount for each Interest Period determined by it, together with the relevant interest payment date, to be
notified to the Issuer and the Paying Agent. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be
rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a
percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or
.0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent
(with one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest
Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and
binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted

262


-----

by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying whether
the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted by any applicable law.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment
is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such
delay.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer is permitted to issue_
additional Notes of the same or different series, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes except
in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied to the Trustee
(“Additional Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the maturity date and the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and,
if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates,
the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest
shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the
determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest
will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees and Security Documents.

All series of Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for
any applicable series; provided that Additional Notes will not be issued with the same CUSIP, ISIN or common
code, as applicable, as any series of existing Notes unless such Additional Notes are fungible with such series of
existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes and Italian income tax purposes. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be
deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes.
Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but
only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes initially issued on the Issue
Date.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Payments of principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes will be made
by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Relevant Clearing System,
which will credit the account specified by the registered Holder thereof (being the nominee of the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream).

263


-----

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained**
for such purposes in London. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option
of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of
Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes (including the initial Paying Agent). The initial
Paying Agent will be GLAS Trust Company LLC (the “Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent” and each
of the Security Agent, Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent, an “Agent”). The initial Registrar and the
initial Transfer Agent will be GLAS Trust Company LLC. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting
ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate
transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the
Holders of the Notes. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Securities Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify
the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as follows:

- each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue
Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

- each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The
Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”
In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will
be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules
and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person
who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S
**Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written**
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Book-Entry;
_Delivery and Form” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction._

264


-----

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected
that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the
participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a
Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where
appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions, and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or
exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes, duties
and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the applicable Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the applicable Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**IPO Pushdown**

(a) On, in contemplation of, or following a public equity offering (an “IPO Event”), the Issuer shall be
entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) shall
automatically operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the basis
that: (i) references to the Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only
to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time; (ii) all financial ratio
calculations, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any Parent of the IPO Pushdown
Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity; (iii) each
reference in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to
the “Issuer” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable and
unless the context requires otherwise); and provided, further, that nothing in this paragraph, including
the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any action related thereto taken by
the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to but in connection with it being deemed to be the Issuer, shall, or shall
be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty,
undertaking, covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (iv) none of the
representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default, as applicable, in the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents shall
apply to any Parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor in respect of the
Notes or otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Parent of the IPO Pushdown
Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking, covenant or other

265


-----

term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (vi) each Parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity
shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any security granted by any
such Parent; (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Issuer: (A) each Person which is party to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an “Investor” (as such term is
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date
specified by the Issuer, that Person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor and shall have no further rights or obligations under
the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor); and (B) there
shall be no obligation or requirement for any Person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement as
an Investor; and (viii) in the event that any Person is released from or does not become party to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor as a consequence of
this paragraph (a), any term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that any Person be an Investor or that any liabilities
or obligations to such Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

(b) The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall be required to enter into any
amendment to the Indenture or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement or the other
collateral documents required by the Issuer in writing and/or take such other action as is required by the
Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by the first paragraph of this
covenant (collectively, an “IPO Pushdown”). The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents
party thereto are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders of the Notes (without any
consent by the Holders of the Notes) to execute any such amended or replacement documents and/or take
other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the reasonable request of and at the cost
of the Issuer).

(c) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer notified to the Trustee by the Issuer in writing as the Person to be treated as the IPO Pushdown
Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided, that the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO
Event (or a Parent of such Restricted Subsidiary).

(d) If the Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time
prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any
Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph (d): (i) the provisions of clauses (i) to
(vii) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if
any security has been released pursuant to paragraph (a) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon
as reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if
any Investor has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(vii) above
in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement as an Investor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in the immediately preceding paragraph shall prohibit or otherwise restrict
the Issuer from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and
(B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or
result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any Person, or
any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Redemption at Maturity**

On February 1, 2028, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and
cancelled at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts,
if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date).

266


-----

**Optional Redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” the Notes are
not redeemable until February 1, 2024.

On and after February 1, 2024, the Issuer may otherwise redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ written notice (except as permitted under “—Selection and Notice”), at
the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if

same series), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding
the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of
principal amount) equal to 100% plus the Applicable Rate in effect on the date of the applicable redemption
notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any
Additional Notes of the same series) issued under the Indenture remain outstanding after each such
redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

In addition, prior to February 1, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Notes upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice (except as permitted under “—Selection and Notice—”), at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus the Applicable Premium and accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject
to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date).

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, the Notes, including a Change of Control Offer
(as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the
Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of the Notes will be deemed
to have consented to such tender or other offer and accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will have the right
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer
expiration date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price
paid (provided that such price shall not be less than 100% of the principal amount) to each other Holder in such
tender offer (other than any early tender premium, incentive payment or similar payment), plus, to the extent not
included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to,
but excluding, the date of such redemption.

**_General_**

We and our shareholders may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or
otherwise. Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice.”

267


-----

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as Notes are listed on the Exchange and
the rules of such Exchange so require, inform the exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate
principal amount of Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If any redemption or repurchase date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will
be subject to redemption or repurchase by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any such
redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. If such redemption is
subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer's discretion,
the redemption date may be delayed or extended until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or
waived, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so
delayed, in each case, as so notified by the Issuer to the Holders of the Notes; provided that in no case shall the
notice have been delivered less than 10 or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any)
occurs except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice
is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. In addition,
the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer's
obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with a satisfaction and discharge or
defeasance of the Indenture in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Defeasance” or
“—Satisfaction and Discharge,” requests that the Trustee distribute to the Holders amounts deposited in trust with
the Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for
redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption, the applicable redemption notice will state that Holders will
receive such amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (i) on or promptly after the date fixed for redemption or
(ii) such earlier payment date as selected by the Issuer.

**_Mandatory Payment_**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, such Notes will be redeemed on a pro rata basis in
accordance with the procedures of Clearstream or Euroclear (as applicable), unless otherwise required by law or
applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent
or the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer shall
provide a copy of any notice to the Exchange not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date
(except as permitted below), mail such notice to Holders of the Notes by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their
respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar with a copy to the Trustee and the
Paying Agent. In the case of Global Notes, such notice of redemption will be delivered in accordance with the
rules and procedures of Clearstream or Euroclear (as applicable), rather than by mail. On and after the redemption
date, interest ceases to accrue on the Notes or the part of the Notes called for redemption.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive
Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed
in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered
Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof.

Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. If such redemption is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the
related notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall
such date of redemption be delayed to a date later than 60 days after the date on which such notice was sent,

268


-----

except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is
issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture), or such
redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem any series of Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior written notice (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date fixed for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), and all Additional Amounts (as defined under “—
_Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption_
Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “—Withholding Taxes/Additional
_Amounts”) affecting taxation; or_

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position, or the introduction of an official position,
regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings
(including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in
published practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined under
“—Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts”) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes or any
Note Guarantee would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes (but, in the case of a
Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor
who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be
avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable), provided that changing the jurisdiction of
the Issuer is not a reasonable measure for purposes of this section. Such Change in Tax Law must not be publicly
announced as formally proposed before and must become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later
date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person
becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the time such successor
Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be delivered in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the Change in Tax Law giving rise to such
obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect, or have a binding effective date which falls before the
payments giving rise to such obligation must be made, at the time such notice is given. Prior to the delivery of
any notice of redemption of any series of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee
(a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts
showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid
its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to
pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely
on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear
of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or
levied by or on behalf of:

269


-----

(1) Italy or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made by or on behalf of the Payor
(including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent) or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident, or has a permanent establishment, for tax purposes, or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax,

(each of clause (1) through (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to be
made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, as
applicable, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received
in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding
from such additional amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of such
payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee, as applicable, in the absence of such withholding or deduction
(the “Additional Amounts”); _provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on_
account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner,
if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability
company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being
resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or
maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership
or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such
Note or Note Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the
Note to comply with a reasonable written request by the Payor (or any other person acting on its behalf)
addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction
would be made, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the
nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or
similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a
statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition
to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, all or part of such Tax but
only to the extent the Holder or such beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or
documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation of the
Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is
permitted or required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment
to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had
the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, stamp, personal property or similar tax, assessment or
other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or
beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant Note to, or
otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent;

(7) any Taxes imposed, withheld or deducted pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor
version of such sections that are substantively comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any
official interpretations thereof, any intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and

270


-----

the United States with respect to the foregoing and any law, regulation, or official interpretation thereof
implementing such intergovernmental agreement, or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section
1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(8) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are on account of imposta sostitutiva (pursuant to Italian Legislative
Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time (“Decree No. 239”) or
pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997)(“Decree No. 461”) and any related
implementing regulations; provided that:

(a) Additional Amounts shall be payable in circumstances where the procedures required under
Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption from _imposta_
_sostitutiva have not been complied with due solely to the actions or omissions of the Payor or_
their agents; and

(b) for the avoidance of doubt, (A) no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to any
Taxes to the extent that such Taxes result from payment to a non-Italian resident legal entity or
a non-Italian resident individual which are subject to imposta sostitutiva by reason of not being
resident in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy,
currently included in the Ministerial Decree September 4, 1996 (the “White List”); (B) no
Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to Taxes to the extent such Taxes are on
account of imposta sostitutiva if the Holder becomes subject to imposta sostitutiva after the
Issue Date by reason of any change in the White List, whereby such Holder’s country of
residence does not appear on the new list and (C) no Additional Amounts shall be payable with
respect to Taxes to the extent such Taxes are for or on account of imposta sostitutiva if the
Holder becomes subject to imposta sostitutiva after the Issue Date by reason of any change in
Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461; or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with
respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner directly held such Notes.

The Payor will (i) make or cause to be made any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will, upon
request, provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to
each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies
of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall
be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant
Paying Agent.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption price, purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto)
or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties
with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration, or
enforcement of the Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or
instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, (A) in connection with a transfer of the Notes after the
Issue Date or (B) to the extent that such stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges

271


-----

or levies become payable upon a voluntary registration made by the Holder if such registration is not required by
any applicable law or not necessary to enforce the rights or obligations of any Holder in relation to the Notes, any
Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto)
or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited solely in the case of any such taxes attributable to the
receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed on a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that
are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) or (5) through (8) or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any transfer
by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a
Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction
from or through which any payment with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of
such Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change of
_Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or_
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, if applicable; _provided_ that Notes of €100,000 may only be
redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to,
but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated
to repurchase any series of Notes as described under this heading in the event and to the extent that it has
unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series and given notice of redemption as
described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of redemption
as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived,
no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice (the “Change of
**Control Offer”) to each Holder of such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:**

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than the later of (x) 60 days
from the date such notice is mailed and (y) the date of completion of the change of control) (the “Change
**of Control Payment Date”);**

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and
that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control
Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes
so tendered;

272


-----

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in
order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer
or cause an adjustment to be made in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, to decrease the principal amount thereof; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its election,
who shall in turn notify such agent as designated by the Issuer in accordance with the Indenture, the Paying Agent
and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been accepted by the Issuer and notified to Issuer’s
designated agent and the Paying Agent, such agent or the Paying Agent shall promptly credit the bank account of
such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of
such Notes from such Holder’s Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) account.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence
of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction
that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes
the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon
the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of
Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a
number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a
mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would
constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repaid or repurchased upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a
default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to
the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer and its Subsidiaries. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash
to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be
no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other
Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. In addition, the definitions of “Change of Control” and
“Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction which is a
Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.

273


-----

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of such Incurrence, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.0 to 1.0, giving _pro forma_ effect to the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof).

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (“Permitted
**Debt”):**

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility
(including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder) and any
Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect of such
Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding the sum
of:

(i) an amount equal to the greater of €65.0 million and 100.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;
_plus_

(ii) to the extent such Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the maximum amount
of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, after giving _pro forma effect to such_
Incurrence (including _pro forma application of the proceeds therefrom), the_
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 4.70 to 1.0; plus

(iii) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or
any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, accrued and unpaid interest,
underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs (including redemption premia and
defeasance costs) and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, so long as such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred by another provision of this
covenant; provided that, if the Indebtedness being Guaranteed is subordinated to the Notes or a Note
Guarantee, then the Guarantee must be subordinated to the Notes or such Note Guarantee to the same
extent as the Indebtedness being Guaranteed; or (b) without limiting the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person_
securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted

to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility after giving _pro forma_ effect to the

of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph above or

covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence or
Incurred by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors in compliance with the third paragraph of this
covenant at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on
the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed
to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the

278

principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums),
defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing; and

(8) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility or letter of credit facility, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as applicable, for borrowings
and reborrowing thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option as elected on the date the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, enters into or increases such commitments, either (a) be determined on
the date of such revolving credit facility, such letter of credit facility or such increase in commitments
(assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based
permission, as applicable, is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing
thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will
be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or
reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the
committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of
credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the
“Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as
applicable) and for purposes of subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated EBITDA-based permission, as
applicable, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such
amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such commitments are outstanding or (b) be determined
on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of
any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness
issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of
any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness denominated in
Euro, the Euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in
the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields
the lower Euro equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that
(a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Euro,
and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall
be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro equivalent
of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to
the Transactions shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and
(c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with
respect to Euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness
expressed in Euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated
based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

284


-----

Subsidiary or otherwise lent to or received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form and
such Indebtedness has been Guaranteed by, or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of, the Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred in accordance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”; and_

(20) without duplication, any dividends, distributions or other payments to any Parent or Unrestricted
Subsidiary to the extent that such dividends, distributions or payments are made in order to carry out
group contributions under the tax laws or regulations of an applicable jurisdiction or pursuant to an
agreement or arrangement described in clause (7) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on
_Affiliate Transactions” up to an amount not to exceed with respect to such Taxes the amount of any such_
Taxes that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been required to pay on a separate
company basis or on a consolidated basis if the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries had paid tax on a
consolidated, combined, group, affiliates or unitary basis on behalf of an affiliate group consisting only
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in clauses (1)
through (20) above, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the
clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investment,” the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted
Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances
existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any
manner that complies with this covenant, including as an Investment pursuant to one or more clauses contained
in the definition of “Permitted Investment.”

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall
be determined conclusively by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment to, or a Permitted Investment into, any
Parent (including by way of prepayment, purchase or redemption of any proceeds loan prior to scheduled maturity)
to fund the repayment, prepayment, purchase or redemption of any Subordinated Indebtedness by such Parent,
there shall be no double-counting of the two transactions for the purposes of this covenant and only the former,
not the latter, shall be deemed a Restricted Payment or a Permitted Investment made by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the Indenture, in no event shall the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary be permitted to dispose of, or grant an exclusive license to, any Material Intellectual
Property, whether as an Asset Disposition, Investment, dividend or otherwise, to any Unrestricted Subsidiary.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this covenant shall prohibit any payments permitted by and made in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur
or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary),
and Holdco will not directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of the collateral owned
by it, in each case, whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any
income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a)
in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property
or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of
Guarantors) are directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, equally and ratably with or prior to,
in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for
so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral,
Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged (i) upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien
to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release _of Liens.” The Security Agent and_

285


-----

the Trustee will take all actions reasonably requested by the Issuer to evidence or effectuate any release of
Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or pursuant to the relevant Security
Document subject to customary protections and/or indemnifications. Any actions by the Security Agent in
accordance with the foregoing will be without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee
(unless action is required by it to effect such release).

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference, in each case with respect to such Indebtedness, and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness resulting solely from fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or
increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including
the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such
an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit
Facility) and any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue
Date, (b) the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
the Security Documents or any related security documents or (c) any other agreement or instrument with
respect to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is
assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other
than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the
funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or
otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection
with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if
another Person is the Successor Company (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any
Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed
acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor
Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument that extends, renews, refinances
or replaces any of the encumbrances or restrictions referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or
this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other
modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided,

286


-----

_however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in_
any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a
whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements
to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or
assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired in the nature of clause (c) of the preceding paragraph, or any encumbrance or
restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer
of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of
all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets
that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority or any governmental licenses, concessions,
franchises or permits, including restrictions or encumbrances on cash or deposits (including assets in
escrow accounts) paid on property;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers,
or as required by insurance, surety or bonding companies or indemnities, in each case, under agreements
or policies entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements, Commodity
Hedging Agreements or Operational Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (A) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit
Facility, together with the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in
each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or (B) the Issuer determines at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely
affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or
(b) that constitutes an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Qualified Receivables Financing; or

287

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens.”

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is not less
than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Issuer); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such
Asset Disposition consists of:

(a) cash (including any net cash proceeds that are reasonably expected by the Issuer acting in good
faith to be received from the conversion, within 180 days of such Asset Disposition, of
securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset Disposition);

(b) Cash Equivalents;

(c) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries
recorded on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the
date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the
Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness as
a result of such Asset Disposition;

Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(g) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash

value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received
and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(h) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (a) through (g) of this clause (2),

provided that this clause (2) shall not apply to the first amount of consideration from such Asset
Disposition not to exceed the greater of €6.5 million and 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA.

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash of the Asset
Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or any premium required by the terms of such
Indebtedness, if any, to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; provided that

Notes through open market purchase or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may
be below par) or (B) makes (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to
the Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provision set forth below for an Asset
Disposition Offer on an equal or ratable basis with such Pari Passu Indebtedness (which offer shall be
deemed to be an Asset Disposition Offer for purposes hereof); or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem
(x) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor or (y) any
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary that is secured by Liens on assets which do not

Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase or by making an Asset Disposition
Offer to all Holders of the Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below); provided, however,
that to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has offered to purchase any amount of the Notes
at a price not less than par, to the extent Holders elect not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the
Issuer will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not
tendered, and such amount shall constitute Declined Proceeds and not increase the amount of Excess
Proceeds; or (b) redeem any series of Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture;

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, a Similar Business, if, after giving
effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4), (5) or
(6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment shall be treated as a
permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of
(x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of
the aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date,

_provided, that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may elect to invest pursuant to clause (3), (4), (5) or (6) of the_
above paragraph (or a combination of the foregoing) prior to receiving the Net Available Cash (provided that such
investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Disposition,
execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant Asset
Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with clause (3), (4),
(5) or (6) (or a combination of the foregoing). The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in
the preceding paragraph constitutes “Excess Proceeds.” To the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has
elected to prepay, repay or purchase any amount of Notes or other Senior Secured Indebtedness (other than the
Notes) at a price of no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, and has extended such offer to the Holders
of the Notes on at least a pari passu basis to the extent the creditors in respect of such Senior Secured Indebtedness
(including the Holders) elect not to tender their Senior Secured Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or
purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not
tendered under this paragraph, and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (such amount,
together with the aggregate amount described under the fourth paragraph of this covenant, the “Declined
_Proceeds”). Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce_

289


-----

revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by
the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition (or the 546[th] day if a binding commitment as described in clause (8)
of the second paragraph of this covenant is entered into) or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €13.0 million and 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer
will be required to make within 30 Business Days thereof an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders
and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to prepay, repay,
purchase or redeem (as applicable) the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness
to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed out of the Excess
Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
and in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or
redemption premium, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable).

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, any remaining Excess
Proceeds shall constitute “Declined Proceeds” and the Issuer may use such proceeds for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition
Offer by Holders and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds
the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a _pro rata_ basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of
tendered Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any
such Indebtedness not denominated in Euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such
principal amounts into their Euro equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset
Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in
Euro that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into Euro.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for such period as the Issuer
determines but in any event no less than 5 Business Days (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than
5 Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase
**Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness**
required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than
the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer
will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable). The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating
that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this
covenant. The Paying Agent shall deliver to the Holders of Notes the purchase price of Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn and arrange for the deduction of the appropriate amounts of Notes from such Holders’ accounts
with Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or
transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €3.3 million
and 5.0% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of €6.5 million
and 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have
been approved by a resolution of the majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of
the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the second_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2) and (11) of the
definition thereof);

(2) any issuance, transfer or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities,
or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, profit sharing plans, stock
appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans
(including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar
plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or
consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of
business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or
between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Receivables Subsidiary in connection
with a Qualified Receivables Financing or other financing permitted by clause (12) of “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness—Permitted Debt”;_

(5) the payment of reasonable compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or
controlled by any of such directors, officers, consultants or employees);

(6) (i) the Transactions, including the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated
by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as
of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented,
extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this
covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and (iii) the
entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement;

-----

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement pursuant to
which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is required or permitted to file a consolidated tax
return, or the formation and maintenance of any fiscal unity or consolidated group for tax, accounting or
cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, contractors, distributors or purchasers or sellers of goods
or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer
or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably
have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Issuer or an Associate or
similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted
Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares)
of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding and entering into any proceeds loan in respect of any Indebtedness of a Parent that
is borrowed or guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that the interest rate and
other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding or proceeds loans (or Guarantees, as
applicable) are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in their
reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction, including satisfying
payment obligations, with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding or proceeds loan (or
Guarantees, as applicable) in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(11) (a) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or
indirectly, including through any Parent) of annual management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees
and related expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of €3.3 million and 5.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA per calendar year and (b) customary payments by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) for
financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment
banking activities, including in connection with loans, capital market transactions, acquisitions or
divestitures, which payments (or agreements providing for such payments) in respect of this clause
(11)(b) are approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith;

(12) any transactions for which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers a written letter or opinion to the
Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might
have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who
is not an Affiliate;

(13) pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(14) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing or otherwise permitted by clause

(15) any participation in a public tender or exchange offer for securities or debt instruments issued by the
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries that are conducted on arm’s-length terms and provide for the same price
or exchange ratio, as the case may be, to all holders accepting such tender or exchange offer.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) (a) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer, commencing with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2022, annual reports containing: (i) an operating and financial discussion of the audited
financial statements, including a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations, and a
discussion of liquidity and capital resources, material commitments and contingencies and critical
accounting policies of the Issuer; (ii) unaudited _pro forma_ income statement and balance sheet

292


-----

information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions
or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as
to which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous
report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); provided that such pro forma financial information will be
provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, and, in the case of a material
acquisition, the Issuer may, at its election, separately provide acquired company financial information;
(iii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years
and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent
two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of
such fiscal years, and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (iv) adjusted
EBITDA for the year; (v) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all
material affiliate transactions; and (vi) a description of material risk factors and material recent
developments (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not require disclosure of confidential negotiations
(as determined in good faith by the Issuer));

(2) within 60 days following the end of the Issuer’s first full fiscal quarter ending after the Issue Date which
is not also the end of a fiscal year of the Issuer, commencing with the first such full fiscal quarter ending
after the Issue Date: (i) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such
quarter and unaudited condensed statement of income and cash flow information for the most recent
quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable
prior period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement
and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently
completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates (provided that such pro forma financial
information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, and, in the case
of a material acquisition, the Issuer may, at its election, separately provide acquired company financial
information); (iii) an operating and financial discussion of the unaudited financial statements, including
a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, adjusted EBITDA and material
changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; and (iv) material recent developments (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, does not require disclosure of confidential negotiations (as determined in
good faith by the Issuer)); and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change
in auditors of the Issuer or, to the extent the immediately succeeding paragraph is applicable, a change
in the auditors of such other relevant Parent, a report containing a description of such event.

The Issuer may fulfil the requirements of this “Reports” covenant with respect to financial information of the
Group by providing financial information relating to any Parent; _provided that such financial information is_
accompanied by a description of the material differences in the financial condition and results of operations
between the Issuer and such Parent in respect of which the reports are being provided hereunder, which summary
description need not be audited and will not include a line-item by line-item reconciliation between financial
information of the relevant Parent and the corresponding information of the Issuer.

Following an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity and/or the listing of such Capital Stock
on a recognized European or United States stock exchange (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Borsa
Italiana), the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO
Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange; provided that to the extent such IPO
Entity relies on such stock exchange reporting requirements to fulfill the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3)
above, a reasonably detailed description of such material differences between the financial statements of such IPO
Entity and the financial statements of the Issuer shall be included for any period after the Issue Date.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or business
acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s pro forma consolidated revenue or
Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act for so long as

293


-----

the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the U.S.
Securities Act.

The Issuer shall be deemed to satisfy its obligations to furnish a report to the Trustee pursuant to this covenant by
making such report available on its website (or a website of a Parent or a Subsidiary of the Issuer). The Issuer
shall also make available to Holders and prospective Holders of the Notes copies of all reports required by this
covenant on the Issuer’s website (or a website of a Parent or Subsidiary of the Issuer). All financial statement
information shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date of such report or financial
statement (or otherwise on the basis of GAAP as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented,
except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses
(1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in GAAP, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to
such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or the relevant
Parent (as applicable). In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, any
failure to comply with this covenant shall be automatically cured when the Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent
of the Issuer, as the case may be, makes available all required reports to the Trustee or makes such required reports
available on the Issuer’s website (or a website of a Parent or Subsidiary of the Issuer).

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary
or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then
the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will
include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto,
of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the
financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act to be filed with the SEC, or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee
reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information,
certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer
will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer
is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the
foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding
paragraphs.

Delivery of information, documents and reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only. The Trustee’s
receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein, including
the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture or documents related therein.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease
or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the Issuer is the surviving entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
**Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European**
Union, the United Kingdom, any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province of Canada, Norway, Singapore or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if
not the Issuer) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the
Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the
Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such

294


-----

transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Company would
be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer
or the Successor Company for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which the transaction is consummated would
not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to
the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any is required
in connection with such transaction) comply with the Indenture, and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal,
valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company (in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel
may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Without prejudice to clause (3) in the immediately preceding paragraph, any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary
that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this
covenant, and any refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in
compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets,
if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor company
will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of a Person.

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may (1) consolidate with or
merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation); (2) sell, assign,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety or substantially as
an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or (3) permit any Person to merge
with or into it unless:

(a) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(b) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and
the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered to the Trustee) and
all obligations of the Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; and (2) immediately after giving effect
to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a

295


-----

Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted
by the Indenture; or

(d) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization,

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall not apply to the extent that_
compliance with clauses (a) and (b)(1) could give rise to or result in: (x) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of
any applicable jurisdiction; (y) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (z) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):
(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; (ii) any
Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or
another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer
is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of
the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents, and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such
transaction; or (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such
entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2)
and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (a) and (b) under the heading “—The Guarantors,” as the
case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing (each, a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion
**Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:**

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”; and

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable
to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard
to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the
Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default.
The “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the Issue
Date but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred
during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so
that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—

296


-----

_Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of_
Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in
the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual
commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having
an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first
paragraph under this caption have been satisfied; provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the
suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes
will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently
omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood, subject to the paragraph below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders; and the Issuer and Holdco shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and
the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Issuer, Holdco and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted
Collateral Liens, (ii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture, the
applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) the
applicable Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified or released from time to time to (a) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or
inconsistency therein; (b) comply, or in accordance, with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (c) add Collateral, (d) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer
or any security provider and the assumption of such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes,
the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security Documents, in each case, including in accordance with the terms
under “—Merger and Consolidation,” (e) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a
successor Trustee or Security Agent and (f) in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders of the Notes in
any material respect; (iv) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests
with respect to the Collateral in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization or otherwise
where permitted by the terms of the Indenture and (v) the Security Interests and the related Security Documents
may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets); provided, however, that in the
case of clauses (i) and (v) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced unless, contemporaneously with any such action, the
Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and of the person granting such Security Interest, in each case, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors or Officer of the relevant Person, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the person granting
such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, as so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released, modified or replaced, are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection
or new hardening period, in equity or at law, to which such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject immediately
prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction)
consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee any Indebtedness under any Credit Facility (including the Revolving
Credit Facility) of the Issuer or a Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding in excess of

297


-----

€50.0 million unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such Guarantee
is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached
to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee; provided, however,
that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as
the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result
in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules
or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers,
directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners
of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—The Note
_Guarantees—Note Guarantees Release.” A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the_
option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which
was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if
such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all
actions reasonably requested by the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance
with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and/or secured to
its satisfaction.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or the
Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing_
clause (1) the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with
the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing
Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially
less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note
Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; _provided_ that such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee
or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement
to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase
the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including, with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement
or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in
right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal
and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred under the Indenture,
(6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, (8) make any other change to any such agreement
that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect or (9) facilitate a Permitted Reorganization. In
formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to request and rely
absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate. The Issuer shall not
otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding,
except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the
Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely

298


-----

affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any Subordinated
Indebtedness thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the offices of the Issuer.

**Financial Calculations**

Any Applicable Metric to be determined in connection with an Applicable Transaction (including whether a
Default or Event of Default is continuing or would result from the Applicable Transaction) may, at the Issuer’s
election (which election the Issuer may revoke and re-make at any time and from time to time), be determined as
at any Applicable Test Date, in each case, where relevant and at the Issuer’s election (which election the Issuer
may revoke and re-make at any time and from time to time), based upon the financial position as at the Applicable
Reporting Date immediately preceding such Applicable Test Date. If the Issuer elects to determine any Applicable
Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, such Applicable Metric shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such Applicable Transactions and to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred up to
(and including) such Applicable Test Date as if they occurred on the first day of the most recently completed
Relevant Period to which the Applicable Reporting Date relates; provided that the pro forma calculation may
exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such
Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that: (a)
the Issuer may elect (which election the Issuer may revoke and re-make at any time and from time to time) to
recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of
redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable
Metric; and (b) save as contemplated in paragraph (a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be
determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or
transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would at
any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a
result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not
be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of
Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of any Applicable Test Date would at
any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence
or continuation of a Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have
been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have
occurred or be continuing).

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “Numerical
**Permission”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (the “Grower Permission”) and the Grower Permission**
of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable Numerical Permission at any time, the Numerical Permission
shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the Grower Permission reached from time to time and
shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the Grower Permission.

If an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred
or issued, any Lien is committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is
tested in reliance on a basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net

299


-----

Leverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Applicable Metric, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the
Incurrence or drawing of any Indebtedness to finance the working capital needs of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other debt which
is available to be re-drawn (including the Revolving Credit Facility and any ancillary facility thereunder) and, for
the avoidance of doubt, subject to clause (9) of the fourth paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness—Permitted Debt”, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including the Revolving Credit_
Facility and any ancillary facility thereunder) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable
Metric.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a four-quarter period, a
twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between
the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or
applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an
amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the
permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding
amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward
Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any
increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by Holdco, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after written notice by
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with
its respective other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries),
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has
been so accelerated, aggregates €25.0 million or more;

(5) other than on a solvent basis, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer
or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

300


-----

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts for
which a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability), which judgments are not paid,
discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default
**provision”);**

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a fair market
value in excess of €15.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under
the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any
such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or Holdco, the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or
unenforceable, and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “security default provision”); and

(8) any Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with
the terms of such Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any
Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee and any such Default
continues for 10 days (the “guarantee default provision”);

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee, by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
under the Indenture, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such
Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under
the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because
an Event of Default described in clause (4) under the definition of “—Events of Default” has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or
payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by
the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been
discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment
of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction
and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that
became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

Any notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of
acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this
section or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first
paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7)
or (8) of the first paragraph of this section or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of
Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder Direction”)
provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written
representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not, or, in the case such
Holder is DTC or Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing System”) or the Relevant
Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not, Net
Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a
notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise
ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a
Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably
request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within
five Business Days of request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the
Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any Position Representation or
Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the
Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines
in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of

301


-----

its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that the Issuer
(i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in
breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant and (ii) has filed papers with a court of
competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its
Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable
Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending
a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s
Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in accordance with such
Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) a
Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, (ii) a Directing Holder has failed to satisfy its
Verification Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction rules that such Directing Holder was, at such time,
not in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period
with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically
stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result
in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the
participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such
Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder
Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred,
and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder
Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall
be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default.
If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in
accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation
is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such
Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction
notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled
to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the
Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein.

Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any agent) shall not be liable to
any party for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder
Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its
sole discretion. The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a
Holder has Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation or
Officer’s Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing
Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court
proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of
Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with
respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative
Instrument or otherwise.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph
of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Notes, such principal of and premium, if any,
and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of
Default arising under clause (5) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and
payable without further action or notice. A notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee
to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or
Event of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more
than two years prior to such notice or instruction. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from
the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if
any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

The Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of all the then outstanding Notes, by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive
any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture or the Security Documents and rescind any
acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on,
premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a non-consenting Holder).

302


-----

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice to the
Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect
to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, the waiver of which shall require
the consent of Holders holding not less than 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected
thereby) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would
not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture
at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or
security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.

Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy
with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and,
if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section,
such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant;

(2) Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) and (8) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing
Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, comprising at least
30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of such security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee
or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the
degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse
to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial
to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action
under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion
against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of
an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture.
The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of
such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after
being so notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any,
or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding
notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, concurrently with delivering its annual report pursuant to clause
(1) of the first paragraph of the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports,” an Officer’s Certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous
year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice
of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer
is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure

303


-----

to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any
further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed
in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant
to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery (prior to acceleration in
respect of the relevant breach) of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable,
even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take
certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take
action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain
exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). In the event any Additional Notes are issued
under the Indenture resulting in more than one series of Notes, if any amendment, supplement or waiver to the
Notes Documents will only affect the one series of Notes, only the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding series of Notes (and not the consent of the Holders of the majority of all of the
Notes), as the case may be, shall be required. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, it is
understood and agreed that any matter described in clause (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) or (9) of this paragraph that by
its terms applies to the Notes of that series shall require the consent of 75% of the Holders of the Notes of that
series in order for it to be binding on all Holders of the relevant series of Notes.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of
the Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may
be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder of any outstanding Note to bring suit for the enforcement of any payment
of principal of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes/Additional
_Amounts” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect;_

(8) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Note Guarantees or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

304


-----

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) to add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect
under the Notes Documents;

(5) to make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation on Additional
_Guarantees,” to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of_
the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note
Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect
thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or
amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this
“Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or security agent pursuant
to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security
interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”
is complied with; or

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. The consent of the
Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any
Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent
to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of
such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by
clause (3) above to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture
providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii)

305


-----

such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be
duly authorized and executed by the Issuer and the Trustee.

The Indenture will not include any covenant regarding payments for consent being offered equally to all Holders.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction,
waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled
by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be
outstanding; provided that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on
any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.
For the avoidance of doubt, no Person will be deemed to control the Issuer unless such Person directly or indirectly
holds 50% or more of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Issuer.

**Meeting of Holders of Notes**

All meetings of Holders of the Notes will be held in accordance with Italian applicable laws and regulations.

In addition to and without prejudice to the provisions described above under “—Amendments and Waivers”, in
accordance with the provisions set forth under the Italian Civil Code, the Indenture will include provisions for the
convening of meetings of the Holders of the Notes to consider any matter affecting their interests, including,
without limitation, the modification or abrogation by extraordinary resolution of any provisions of the Notes or
the Indenture. A meeting may be convened either (i) by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, (ii) by the
Noteholders’ Representative (as defined below) or (iii) upon request by Holders of at least 5.0% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

In accordance with the Italian Civil Code, the vote required to pass a resolution by a meeting of the Holders of
Notes will be (i) in the case of the first meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of more than
one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, and (ii) in the case of the second and any
further adjourned meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of at least two-thirds of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes so present or represented at such meeting. Any such second or further
adjourned meeting will be validly held if there are one or more persons present that hold or represent Holders of
more than one-third of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes; _provided, however,_ that the
Issuer’s bylaws may provide for a higher quorum (to the extent permitted under Italian law). Certain proposals,
as set out under Article 2415 paragraph 1, item 2, and paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code (namely, the
amendment of the economic terms and conditions of the Notes) may only be approved by an extraordinary
resolution passed at a meeting of Holders of the Notes (including any adjourned meeting) by one or more persons
present that hold or represent Holders of not less than one-half of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes.

With respect to the matters set forth in the second paragraph under “—Amendments and Waivers”, and to the
extent permitted under Italian law, the Indenture will contractually increase the percentage of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes otherwise required by Article 2415 of the Italian Civil Code to pass an extraordinary
resolution with respect to such matters from 50% to 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes and the capital structure—The Issuer may amend the
_economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all noteholders with the vote of either_
_75% or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes”. Any resolution duly passed at_
any such meeting shall be binding on all the Holders of the Notes, whether or not such Holder was present at
such meeting or voted to approve such resolution. To the extent provided by the Italian Civil Code, the resolutions
passed by a meeting of Holders of the Notes can be challenged by Holders pursuant to Articles 2377 and 2379 of
the Italian Civil Code.

The Indenture will provide that the provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” will be in
addition to, and not in substitution of, the provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers”. As such and
notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, supplement and/or waiver, in addition to complying with the
provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” must also comply with the other provisions
described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

**Security Representative and Noteholders’ Representative**

306


-----

Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase of the Notes
on the Issue Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of the Holders of the
Notes of the initial appointment as of the Issue Date of GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as representative
(rappresentante) pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (the “Security
**Representative”) in order to create and grant in its favor security interests and guarantees securing and**
guaranteeing the Notes and entitle it to exercise in the name and on behalf of the Holders of the Notes all their
rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to such security interests and
guarantees. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture each Holder of the Notes from time to time, by accepting a
Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of GLAS Trust Corporation Limited as
Security Representative.

Moreover, a common representative of the Holders of the Notes (rappresentante comune) (the “Noteholders’
**Representative”) may be appointed pursuant to Articles 2415 and 2417 of the Italian Civil Code by the Holders**
of the Notes in order to represent the interests of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2418 of the Italian
Civil Code as well as to give effect to resolutions passed at a meeting of the Holders of the Notes. Pursuant to the
terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase of the Notes on the Issue
Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of the Holders of the Notes of the
initial appointment as of the Issue Date of GLAS Specialist Services Limited, as the Noteholders’ Representative.
If the Noteholders’ Representative is not appointed by a meeting of the Holders of the Notes, the Noteholders’
Representative shall be appointed by a decree of the Court where the Issuer has its registered office upon request
by one or more Holders of the Notes or upon request by the directors of the Issuer. The Noteholders’
Representative remains appointed for a maximum period of three financial years but may be subsequently
reappointed thereafter.

**Italian Usury Law**

Notwithstanding any provisions in the Indenture to the contrary, (x) the Issuer and each Guarantor (by

signing the Indenture and any supplemental indenture, as applicable) and (y) each holder (by accepting a Note)
shall be deemed to have acknowledged, accepted and agreed that, if the remuneration applicable to the Notes
(including interest, default interest, fees, charges, expenses and other costs and any other form of compensation
related to the Notes (the “Total Remuneration”)) at any time exceeds the maximum remuneration permitted
under Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996, as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and
regulations (the “Italian Usury Law”), then the Total Remuneration shall immediately and automatically be
reduced to the maximum admissible remuneration pursuant to the Italian Usury Law for, and limited to, the period
during which it is not possible to apply the remuneration as originally provided.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Notes and the
Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate
(other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Restricted Subsidiaries’ obligations under the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants_
described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross
acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to any Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment
default provision, the guarantee default provision and the security default provision described under “—Events of
_Default” (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under

307


-----

“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant
Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euro
or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, provided that,
if requested by the Issuer, the Trustee will distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the
Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a
ruling received by the Issuer from, or published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in
applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and qualifications), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with
either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except
as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture)
as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than
certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made
and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation;
or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable,
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be
deposited in trust with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this
purpose), with respect to the Notes, money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not
previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date
of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date,
as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the
Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money
toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be, and (5) the Issuer has
delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (provided that such counsel may not
be an employee of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the
“Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture
have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of
fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). The Trustee or the Paying Agent (or
such other entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, acting
for the Trustee for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited pursuant to this paragraph to the Holders
on the date specified in writing (in the above-referenced notice of redemption or Officer’s Certificate or otherwise)
by the Issuer at least two Business Days prior to the specified date of distribution, which date of distribution may
in the Issuer’s discretion be prior to the Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. For the
avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the redemption date as set forth above will

308


-----

not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.
To the extent the Notes are represented by a Global Note deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any
payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be
subject to the then applicable procedures of the Relevant Clearing System.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as
such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a
Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the
view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

GLAS Trust Company LLC is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that,
except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth
specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the
rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would
use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action
enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer,
to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim
as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer
and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer, and
(2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes
incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any
Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the
Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee. Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become
effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or expenses
Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices, warnings, summonses and other communications to the Holders of the Notes from the Trustee shall be
sent via Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) for so long as the Notes are held as Global Notes with a copy to
the Issuer and to the Exchange to the extent required by the rules thereof. Any such notice or communication shall
be deemed to be given or made when sent from Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). For so long as the Notes
are held as Global Notes, the Issuer’s written notifications to the Holders of Notes shall be sent through Euroclear
or Clearstream (as applicable) with a copy to the Trustee and the Exchange (to the extent required by the rules of
the Exchange). Additionally, for so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notices with respect to the Notes
will be published on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this “Description of the Notes,” the notice requirements in the
Indenture will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream for so long as the
Notes are held as Global Notes. To the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream
conflict with any requirements applicable to notices under the Indenture, a notice will be deemed to satisfy such
requirements if it complies with the mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream concerning the
content, timing and procedure for delivering notices and otherwise complies with any applicable requirements
under the Indenture.

309


-----

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will
be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the
Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or in
connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes is euro. Any amount received or
recovered in a currency other than euro (whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a
court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Holder
in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer will constitute a discharge of the Issuer only to the
extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that
other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date,
on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be
due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it as a
result. In any event the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro equivalent for purposes hereof that is denominated in a currency other
than euro shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro
amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since the substantial majority of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with respect
to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any
purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—The Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Indebtedness for purposes of the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be treated in

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE**
**GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees
and the security interests in each of the jurisdictions in which Guarantees or Collateral are being provided. It is a
summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these
jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes and it does not purport to
be complete or to discuss all the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the
Notes or the Guarantees or security interests being provided for the Notes. The application of these various laws
in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, and could adversely
affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and the
security interests on the Collateral. Prospective investors should consult their own legal advisors with respect to
such limitations and considerations.

Also set out below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, England and Wales,
France, Germany, Spain, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.

**European Union**

The Issuer and some of the Guarantors are incorporated and organized under the laws of member states
of the European Union (the “EU”).

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies to
insolvencies which commence after 26 June 2017 (subject to certain exceptions).

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than Denmark) where
the company concerned has its “centre of main interests.” The determination of where any such company has its
“centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have
differing and conflicting views.

The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is
determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings
at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the centre of main
interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary.
That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within
the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the
presumption of the centre of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the
company’s central administration is located in an EU member state other than the one where it has its registered
office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is
ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of
the management of its interests is located in that other EU member state. In that respect, the factors that courts
may take into consideration when determining the center of main interests of a debtor can include where board
meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and
the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the
centre of the company’s operations.

If the centre of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in
an EU member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction (subject to
exceptions) to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation.
The types of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are
listed in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation.

If the centre of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under
Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have
jurisdiction to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company
has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the
territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in
Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are
commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any
place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request

348


-----

to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects
of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU member state are restricted to the assets of the company
which are situated in such other EU member state.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state
in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings
can only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a)
insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s centre of main interests
is situated under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request
of a creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or a public authority has the right to
request the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or
secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by
the Lex fori concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency
proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
opening main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the
other relevant EU member state so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency
officeholder appointed by a court in a EU member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may
exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as
to remove assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no
insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure taken to the
contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company
has assets.

The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by
the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order
to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members.

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency
Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a
group of companies in one or more member states of the EU (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the
Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction
over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency
proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the
coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would
be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of
the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

**Italy**

**_Limitation on granting of security interests and on enforcement under Italian law_**

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting
of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its
bylaws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization
and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context
of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be
triggered.

**_Corporate benefit_**

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest)
must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by
such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed
and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors
and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant
company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of
the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for

349


-----

downstream security or guarantee (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing, or a security interest granted to secure, financial
obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and
effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure
financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an
entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the
granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive
adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an
up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may
include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other
members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely
untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such
transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed
by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or
indirect economic benefit to it.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting
a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a
conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the
subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor
if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within
the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate
benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising
control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control.
Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be
declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and
such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream
guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity
within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian
**Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries.**
Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees
being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing
Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of
security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify
as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the
meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies, which are under the control of the same
entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the Guarantor and the guaranteed entity being part of
the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

**_Financial assistance_**

In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability
which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may
be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give
financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or
subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls
the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or
subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation
of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions
is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the
company.

**_Trust_**

The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as
representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian
Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security
interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in

350


-----

favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the
name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings)
relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the
exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to
Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf the holders of the Notes
which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share
certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the
appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes
pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that
therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured
by the security under the Security Documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce
the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject
matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested
by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it
cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where
the Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are
not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral.

Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative
(rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code
may be validly appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and
enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court.

Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest
can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly
parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share
certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no
established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the
duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain
under Italian law.

**_Certain considerations in relation to guarantees and security interests_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to
protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this
respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or
exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the
management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company
incorporated in Italy as a _società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that_
borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the
kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to
its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan
(“undercapitalization”). Pursuant to article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code (as defined below), any payment
made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration are
ineffective by operation of law. The new provision replaced article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code,
according to which such payments would be required to be returned to the borrower. For a more detailed
explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw back actions in an insolvency scenario, see
“Certain Italian Insolvency Laws Considerations—Judicial Winding-Up (liquidazione giudiziale)” and
“Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. In addition to that, Article 292, paragraph 1, of
the Italian Insolvency Code sets forth that claims of entities exercising management and coordination powers vis_à-vis the entities subject to such powers and claims of the entities subject to such powers vis-à-vis the entities_
exercising them deriving from loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of judicial winding
up of in the year before, are subordinated.

The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that
such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company
by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly.

351


-----

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above.
Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies
incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a
_società per azioni._

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts
may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the
relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian
subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any
of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the
obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able
to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have
a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans
or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral
created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian
subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

**_Certain limitations on enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially
in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in
comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of
the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction
of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by
ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and
security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges
by the appointed bankruptcy or judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness
or avoidance or clawback of (i) Italian bankruptcy law (i.e. Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16[th] 1942, as amended
and supplemented from time to time, the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) and/or (ii) Italian Insolvency Code and the
relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect
period. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an
insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws Considerations— Judicial Winding-Up (liquidazione
_giudiziale)” and “Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. If challenged successfully, the_
guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the
insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes
could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the
related security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or
there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could
have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in
general may be subject to, among others, the following aspects:

      - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below
relating to or affecting the rights of creditors;

      - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures,
the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

      - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive),
each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not
offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code;

352


-----

- claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision
of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e
_decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to_
counterclaim;

- pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for
the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary
obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a
matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that
such opinion is based on reasonable grounds;

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law
may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di
_applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be_
deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific
criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular
agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such
agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by
its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso
_del diritto);_

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument
may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation
pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal,
invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in
order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the
interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties
following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil
Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest
for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the
Italian Civil Code are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such
interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation, a receiver
is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the court and
creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions
(including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay).
Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the
pledgee is expressly authorized by the court or, in case of judicial liquidation, to have the
pledged assets assigned at a fair market value returning any excess to the judicial liquidation
estate; the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the
year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or,
in the absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand
(precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the
extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant
foreclosure proceeding or bankruptcy/judicial liquidation proceedings;

353


-----

      - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such
assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an
undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly.
One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the
execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states
the date of witnessing on the document;

      - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning
advance waivers or forfeitures;

      - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is
prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct
(dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions;

      - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

      - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian
company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including,
among others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the
interest rate permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury
law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any
portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with
Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and
unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started
or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an
agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative
Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian Banking Act )) may not be enforceable;

      - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the
other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such
other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement;

      - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation;

      - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the secured
creditor from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the
relevant pledge; and

      - in case of bankruptcy (to the extent applicable after July 15, 2022) or judicial liquidation of the
grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold
to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding or in case of a judicial
liquidation the pledged assets can also be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value
and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee
but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting
rights on the pledged quotas/shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action
can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a
guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Articles 2901 and following of the Italian Civil Code
(which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security,
agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court
could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of
the prejudice, was to make the two following findings:

      - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting
creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was
fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

354


-----

      - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and,
if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party
participated in the fraudulent design.

**_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions
with which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in
court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy
can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may
be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include
special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved
activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly-owned
companies are involved.

Insolvency laws and regulations have been replaced by a new crisis and insolvency code. In particular,
the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019
implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a
comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters (the “Legislative
**Decree”), which enacts a comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters**
which came into force on July 15, 2022 (so-called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter, as
subsequently amended and supplemented and including Legislative Decree No. 83 of 17 June 2022 implementing
the EU Directive 2019/1023, the “Italian **Insolvency Code”). Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta**
_Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38— Suppl. Ordinario no. 6._

The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term
“bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)
with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of
the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different restructuring
tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società) provided for by the
same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the
pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings;
(vi) a new crisis settlement procedure (composizione negoziata della crisi); (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts
over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) the adoption of definition of debtor’s “center of main interest” as
provided in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings, (ix) the introduction of the new restructuring
plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) among the restructuring tools
and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società); (x) the regulation of
adequate measures and plans to early detect a crisis with specific criteria to be adopted by companies and (xi)
amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the
reform.

The Italian Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by, among others, (i) the Italian
Legislative Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020, (ii) the Italian Draft Legislative Decree on “Amendments to
_the Business Crisis and Insolvency Code, implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1023” approved on March 17, 2022_
by the Italian Council of Ministers (Consiglio dei Ministri) and (iii) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of June
17, 2022.

Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force
on March 16, 2019, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Italian Insolvency Code
has been initially postponed to September 1, 2021 by the “Decreto liquidità” (i.e., Law Decree April 8, 2020, no.
23, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on April 8, 2020 and converted in law by the Italian Parliament by the Law
June 5, 2020, no. 40, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on June 6, 2020 the “Liquidity Decree”), and is now
effective starting from July 15, 2022.

Provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law continue to apply only to any filings for proposals of
declaration of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato fallimentare) and any filings
seeking for the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) or for the opening
of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) filed or pending before July 15, 2022 (i.e. the
effective date of the Italian Insolvency Code).

355


-----

Considering the above, the following is a brief description of certain main aspects of insolvency law in
Italy as it stands now and in particular: (i) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the other ancillary applicable
regulations in place until July 15, 2022 and (ii) of the Italian Insolvency Code after its entry into force.

In particular, below is a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the
other ancillary applicable regulations.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the
goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis”
procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by
the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses
being sold.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the
insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or
one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor
is no longer able to regularly meet with ordinary means its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent,
rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases
where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it
may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence
of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency,
and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

In addition to the _composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato per la_
_liquidazione del patrimonio described below, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are_
available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies

_Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali):_

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it provides the debtor with
significant advantages and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court
restructuring are vulnerable to being very likely reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and
possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger various liabilities in the event of a subsequent
bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing temporary financial difficulties, it may be
possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the
company.

_Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa (introduced by Law Decree 118/2021)_

The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in
the two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Law Decree
118/2021 requesting the competent court pursuant to art. 9 of the Italian Insolvency Law, to confirm or modify
the protective measures (the “Protective Measures”), and, if necessary, to enact the interim measures provided
for pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021 on the same day as the publication of the request in the
relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the acceptance of the Expert (as defined below); and
if necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures” and, together with the Protective Measures,
the “Measures”), and (ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021
asking the court to authorize certain acts, or to modify the conditions of certain contracts if, as a consequence of
the COVID-19 pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur.

The composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore
_commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with reference to their_
assets, their business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow and it is likely
that the financial recovery shall occur, notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian
Bankruptcy Law are not met. Pursuant to Article 5 of the Law Decree 118/2021, inter alia, the entrepreneur or
the enterprise filing for a composizione negoziata della crisi (i) shall certify that no requests for the admission to
a concordato preventivo procedure nor accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti have been previously filed to the
court in such respect and (ii) in the event that the application for a composizione negoziata della crisi is dismissed,
may not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after the aforementioned dismissal.

Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi may also
apply to group of companies, in order to provide for the possibility of the negotiated proceeding to take place in

356


-----

a unitary form. It should be noted that Paragraph 10 of such provision provides for the group companies – at the
end of the negotiations – to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 11 of the Law Decree
118/2021 (as set out below) as a whole group or enter separately as single companies into the solutions referred
to therein.

The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with
the filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and an independent expert (the “Expert”) which
however, pursuant to Article 23 of the Law Decree 118/2021, is prevented for enterprises having filed to access
the procedures, debt restructuring agreements and/or concordato preventivo, including (i) pursuant to Article 161,
Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, (ii) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law and (iii) the procedures of over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in
Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No.3 of January 27, 2012 (i.e. _procedimenti di composizione della crisi da_
_sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio) pending such procedures. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Law_
Decree 118/2021 the person who acted as Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have or maintain
professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following the termination of the negotiated
proceeding.

If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the
parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic
meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and
with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s financial and business
situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course
of the negotiations.

If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with
the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the
chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition.

The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties
have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s
distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue for up to an additional 180 days (pursuant
to Article 5, Paragraph 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so
and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has
filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021.

Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the
Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur
and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any), which declares the
termination of their related effects.

Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the
Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures. The
Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting
creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all
enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo,
payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims.

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until
the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the
entrepreneur cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent by the court.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform
their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate
their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground
of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the
Protective Measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), he
must simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said
measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective
Measures will be ineffective.

357


-----

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an
order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the
opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a
maximum of 240 days. The judge, in his or her discretion, may order the revocation of such Protective Measures
or shorten their duration.

Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective
Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the
purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations or appear to be disproportionate compared to the prejudice
caused to the creditors that file the relevant request.

Pursuant to Article 9 of the Law Decree 118/2021, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry
out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to
extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of
recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business.
Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are
real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject
to his liabilities.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the
perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If,
notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate
notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. When Protective
Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court which may revoke such
measures or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021.

Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the
extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization
of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize:

(a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new
super-senior indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) via
shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the
effects provided under Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will
be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking into account the requests of
the parties concerned, in order to protect the interests of all relevant parties involved.

Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate
as follow:

(a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which
constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree
118/2021 if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the
business as a going concern for at least 2 years;

(b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182
octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the
Expert, with the effects provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.
In such case, the independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter
d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, shall not be required.

At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a
debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis,
Article 182 septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

358


-----

Alternatively, the entrepreneur may:

(a) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant
to Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(b) file a petition for admission to the _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del_
_patrimonio pursuant to Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021, which pursuant to Article 11 of the Law_
Decree 118/2021 can be filed only following the end of the negotiations;

(c) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy
Law or in the so-called Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure.

Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021:

(i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021
maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring
agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato),
sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato
_preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory administrative winding-_
up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large
insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or concordato semplificato per
_la liquidazione del patrimonio;_

(ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions
and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment,
are exempted from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 2, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law if they are consistent with the development and the status of the
negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time
the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made;

(iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the
Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article
66 and Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if the Expert has registered his/her
dissent in the companies’ register or if the court has denied its authorization pursuant
to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021;

(iv) payments and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the
Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the
perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been
authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, benefit of
exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions provided for
pursuant to Article 216 and 217 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

_Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio (introduced by Law Decree_
_118/2021)_

Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy
composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio).

If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have
been conducted according to fairness and in good faith, and that the options provided under Article 11, Paragraphs
1 and 2, of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report
the entrepreneur may file, with the competent court of the place where the company has its registered office, a
petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a
liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and d) of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, which may divide the creditors into various classes. The petition for concordato semplificato
_per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing_
with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 111, 167, 168 and 169 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply.

359


-----

The court issues a decree approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and
regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with
preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause
a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the
entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after
having been notified of the same.

_Out-of-court reorganization plans (Piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian_
_Bankruptcy Law_

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento)
prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial
condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring
plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval
to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet
the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of
misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and,
therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt
restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all
outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at
restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy
agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the
debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors or
any public authority including tax authorities. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail
and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the
implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action;
and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court
nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is
possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity
or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring
agreement.

_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi_
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_

The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt
restructuring agreements, subject to court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the
debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that
the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the
following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which
are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case
of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation
of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this
process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its
creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication.
Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any
conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and
cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law
does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The
plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third

360


-----

party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs
and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for
the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned
publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the
companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the
completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication
and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At
such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such
case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests
(unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which
a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited.

The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an
application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the
moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication
of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate
the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the
outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._

The new Article 182-bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69
of May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial
amendments are made to the plan, inter alia, if any substantial change to the plan are is necessary or required
before or after the homologation of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors, the entrepreneur shall make the
appropriate changes aimed at the implementation of such plan, requesting (i) the independent expert to renew its
report as well as (ii) the creditors involved in such debt restructuring agreement to manifest their consent the
necessary amendments.

The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and
introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182 octies, Article 182 novies and Article 182 decies,
thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree
118/2021, the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is
reduced to the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under
Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (therefore implying that the plan
must be adequate and capable for the full and timely payment of dissenting creditors); (b) does not previously file
a petition for admission to the concordato in bianco pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, and (c) does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into
debt restructuring agreements by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits
belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and
can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a socalled “cram-down”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-participating creditors shall be
satisfied to a no lesser extent than the liquidation alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be
of a non-liquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business
activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category (and, therefore, affected
by the proceeding) have been duly notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and
have been notified the debt restructuring agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa) and the
related documentation. If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of non-participating creditors belonging to
the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, non-participating crammed down creditors can challenge
the deal and refuse to be forced into it.

361


-----

Pursuant to Article 11 of The Law Decree 118/2021 the percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach
of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations
pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi.

Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision
is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation
the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial
intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the
agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is
valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern.
However, in such case, the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid.

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement
(convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class would
also bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements
provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) the truthfulness of the
business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii)
the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the recovery
strategies undertaken by the debtor, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to
the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations have been made able to
participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets,
economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down
creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and
the standstill agreement provided under Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new
obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing
facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-participating creditors.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree
118/2021, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring
agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable
with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed
otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with nonlimited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable
as guarantors

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant
to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors)
enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by
shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of
a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court- supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors
(finanza ponte) or granted in execution of the composition with creditors (finanza in esecuzione) may be granted
such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is
expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the
agreement or the approval of the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors.

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending
the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph
6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
(in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy arrangement with creditors procedure described below) may
authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such
indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by
the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione),
declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay
pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided
that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure
the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended
by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional
documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

362


-----

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring
agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo)
outlined below.

Furthermore, according to the Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending
the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182- bis, Paragraph 1 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph
6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so-called
_prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_
company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii)
that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an
imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company.

_Court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount
to insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal
to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its
business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such
composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i)
has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding
fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three
preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can
initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring
plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness
of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then
published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the date on which the
court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt
became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all
enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand,
are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages
registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published
in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and
payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at
least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the
going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated
companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt
securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the
composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging
to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or
deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary
petition for a concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013
(“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from
the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective
receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within
a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition,
subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such
extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of
a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts
such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the
company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of
nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further
verification, may reject the petition at court for a _concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and_

363


-----

information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the
stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo
also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco).

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two
years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the
presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the
financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the
application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse
of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors
being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the
relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities
carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the
restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial
commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with
creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s
authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent.

Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior
indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement
pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium
application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan
pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial
needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended
by Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so-called _prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian_
Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back
action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the superseniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary
petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed
within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same
proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition.

The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by
the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any
assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In
these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected
as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and
support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the
business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal
was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among
others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato)
to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’
meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its
corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge.
The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization,
while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim
acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable
vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that
the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The Composition with Creditors
is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015

364


-----

abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those
who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed
as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their
voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of
the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be deemed
not to approve the _concordato preventivo_ proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the
_concordato proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to_
meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in
the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of
holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to
vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato
_preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such_
value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their
debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the _concordato preventivo_ (notwithstanding the
circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the
court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to
other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors
or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the
court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely
to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for
individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the
aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement
proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the
proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in
case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the
unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation
of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a
pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy
agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest
by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of
their claims.

This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the
going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may
grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including
by taking all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as
amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato
_preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for_
the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial
commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in
the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible
objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a
confirmation order.

Pursuant to article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to
be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti),
except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment
agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti
_preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di_
_locazione di immobili). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application_
for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the
procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not
exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an

365


-----

indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification
would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the
public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company
bankrupt.

_Impacts of the COVID-19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings_

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, inter
_alia, on insolvency matters (in addition to the Law Decree 118/2021 mentioned above) in order to (i) preserve the_
continuity of companies throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and after its end, with particular regard to those that
were trading on a going concern basis before the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of
certain insolvency proceedings already pending during the COVID-19 pandemic or already approved by the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among such legislative measures, the Italian Government enacted the Liquidity Decree.

According to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree the deadlines for the fulfilment of concordati preventivi
and the ratified debt restructuring agreements provides, among other things, the extension of 6 months of the
deadlines for fulfillment of the obligations provided in an approved concordato preventivo or accordo di
ristrutturazione dei debiti omologati based on a plan expiring after February 23, 2020 shall be extended by six
month. In the procedures for the approval (omologazione) of a concordato and of a debt restructuring agreement
with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), pending on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until
the hearing, a petition for the grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal
for a concordato preventivo in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt
restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date
of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if
submitted in the context of a concordato preventivo in the course of which it has already been held the meeting
of creditors but the majorities were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Also, a set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/preinsolvency scenarios. The rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different
company type) of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with respect
to losses arisen in the financial year ended on December 31, 2020 and until the five subsequent financial years.
This measure, originally provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree, subsequently replaced by Article 1,
Paragraph 266, of Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020, is intended to address the risk that the impact of losses
arising from the COVID-19 pandemic on the share capital of companies push directors into the unsustainable
position of choosing between the following: (i) putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or
insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal liability as a result of the delay in complying with such
obligations.

_Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_

A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the
judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public
prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor
is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared
by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises
(imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_
had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding
fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things:

    - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file claims
within a defined period;

    - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as
their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of

366


-----

liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant
expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits,
any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s
other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization.
After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court
decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in its decision;

    - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy
receiver (curatore fallimentare);

    - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater
damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause
damage to creditors;

    - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in
certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other
than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and

    - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some
or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided
for by Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a
deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of
any one of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of
creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The
liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets
include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence
the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to
certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such
priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is
unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements
would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided
by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds
and assets (if any) as below indicated.

    - **_Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare)._** Bankruptcy proceedings can
terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The
relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the
declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal
only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree
giving effectiveness to the bankruptcy’s estate (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to
vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or
the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market
value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case
they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may
provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the
classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that
secured claims are paid only in part. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the
creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are
formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation
is also required.

    - **_Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law_**
may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU
jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall
be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims

367


-----

originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of
claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of
unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the
proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including the claims of the Italian tax
authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining
priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati;
a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages
(creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti
_chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed_
according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority
rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on
equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to
when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof,
or from a single asset.

    - **_Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or_**
avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, among others, to the revocation of
payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of
bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value,
preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules
under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy
compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year
(six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. Please
note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period
may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts
or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request
of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

**_Acts ineffective by operation of law._**

Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions
entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the
two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant
to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon
registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the
transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated
judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due
on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the
bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.

**_Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver._**

The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below (so-called
“suspect period”), may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or
constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

    - onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of
the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the
consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

    - payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other
customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration;

    - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration
in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time when the new security was
granted; and

368


-----

    - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency
declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time when the
new security was granted.

The following acts and transactions, if made during the suspect period or such other period specified
below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the noninsolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction:

    - payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into
or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and

    - granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration.

The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

    - payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice;

    - a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the
bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

    - the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil
Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended
as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or
a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser;
provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein
or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

    - transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan
(piano attestato) under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

    - a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of “concordato
_preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione del_
_debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_

    - remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried
out by them; and

    - payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to
services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt
entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided
for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions
whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective
with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction
was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered
into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a
transaction entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if
the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated
in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a
“simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor
with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now
start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing
back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out
without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called
_fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried_
out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser.

**_Italian Insolvency Code_**

Please find below a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code after its entry
force on July 15, 2022 which supersedes the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The two primary aims of the Italian Insolvency Code are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the
goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. The aim of the “Prodi-bis”
procedure or “Marzano” procedure (which remain available to large companies also in the context of the new set
of rules, as will be further detailed below), is to maintain employment. These competing aims often have been
balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the
businesses being sold.

Under the Italian Insolvency Code, the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) must be declared by
a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a debtor upon a petition filed by the debtor itself, the public
prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2, letter (b) of the Italian Insolvency
Code, is defined as the state of the debtor, manifested by defaults and/or other external elements evidencing that
the debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not
a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a debtor is insolvent. The Italian Insolvency
Code also introduced a specific concept of crisis, which is defined under Article 2, letter (a) of the Italian
Insolvency Code as the state of the debtor such that it is likely that insolvency will follow, which is manifested
by the inadequacy of prospective cash flows to meet obligations in the following 12 months. Both insolvency and
crisis are factual situations upon the occurrence of which different instruments provided for by the Italian
Insolvency Code may be activated.

In cases where a debtor is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, a state
of crisis/financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors,
which may safeguard the existence of the debtor, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the
event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

The following debt restructuring and insolvency alternatives are available under Italian law for
companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent debtors and, in certain cases, also to debtors experiencing an
economic or financial imbalance such as to make it likely that a state of crisis and/or distress or their insolvency
will occur.

_Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for
the debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring
are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as
voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases
where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court
arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.

_Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code_

The _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa was originally introduced in the_
Italian legal framework by Law Decree 118/2021 and has been subsequently incorporated into the Italian
Insolvency Code. It is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following
circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code
requesting the competent court to confirm or modify the Protective Measures provided for pursuant to Article 18
of the Italian Insolvency Code on the same day as the publication of the request in the relevant Companies’
Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the acceptance of the Expert (as defined below), and, if necessary, to enact
the Interim Measures necessary to complete the negotiations, and (ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition asking
the court to authorize certain acts in line with the provisions set forth under Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency
Code.

The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is a proceeding aimed at facilitating
the recovery of companies which “despite being in conditions of asset or economic and financial imbalance
_such as to make it likely that financial distress or insolvency will occur, have the potential to remain in the_
_market, including through the sale of the business or a branch of it.”_

370


-----

According to Article 12 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the _composizione negoziata per la soluzione_
_della crisi d’impresa_ can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore commerciale) and
agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are undergoing a distressed situation with reference to their assets,
their business and/or their financial situation, such that it is likely that a distress/crisis or insolvency will
follow. It is, therefore, a procedure aiming at anticipating further deterioration of the debtor’s situation. Pursuant
to Article 17, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code, inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise
filing for a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa (i) shall certify that no judicial windingup proceedings or similar proceedings are pending towards itself nor requests for the admission to the procedures
provided for under Articles 40 of the Italian Insolvency Code, including pursuant to Articles 44, paragraph 1,
letter a) and 54, paragraph 3, have been previously filed and (ii) in the event that the application for a composizione
_negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is dismissed, other than the case where such dismissal is requested_
by the entrepreneur, may not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after dismissal.

Pursuant to Article 25 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della
_crisi d’impresa_ may also apply to group of companies, which may commence one proceeding all together. It
should be noted that paragraph 9 of such provision provides for the group companies—at the end of the
negotiations—to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 23, paragraph 1 of the Italian
Insolvency Code as a group, or use one of the tools referred to under Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code,
both separately or as a whole group. The _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa_ is
commenced on a voluntary basis only, filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and independent
expert to the Secretary General of the relevant Chamber of Commerce by way of a dedicated electronic platform
(the “Expert”). Pending a procedure for over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets
referred to in Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No 3 of 27 January 2012 (i.e., procedimenti di composizione della
_crisi da sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio), the petition cannot be filed. Pursuant to Article 16_
of the Italian Insolvency Code the person who acted as Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have
or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following the termination of the
negotiated proceeding.

The Expert is appointed within five days upon the filing of the request. The Expert is responsible for
facilitating and managing the negotiations between the company, its creditors and any other interested parties, in
order to identify a solution to overcome the crisis or the insolvency, including through the transfer of the business
or a branch thereof.

The Expert assesses his/her own independence, the adequacy of his/her own professional expertise and
his/ her own time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is
positive, notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the Platform. In case of negative
outcome, the Expert confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a new Expert. If the Expert
accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are concrete and real
chances of recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally, and can be assisted by its advisors.

If the Expert finds that there are concrete and real chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with
the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling
periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good
faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the
actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the
negotiations. The entrepreneur must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation and manage
his/her assets without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents,
and, in case of credit assignment and/or transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations
actively and in an informed manner, and the access to the _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi_
_d’impresa_ does not, by itself, constitute ground for withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions apply
to negotiations involving employment contracts.

If the Expert finds that there are no real chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the
entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber
of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is
considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can
also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s
appointment can continue up to further 180 days (pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 7 of the Italian Insolvency
Code) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of
the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article
19 and/ or Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

371


-----

Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 8 of the Italian Insolvency Code, at the end of his/her appointment the
Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur
and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any) which declares the
termination of their related effects.

Pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with the petition for appointment of the
Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures, which
may also be limited, upon entrepreneur request, to certain creditors’ claims or to a specific category of creditors.
The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting
creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all
enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo,
payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until
the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for the composizione negoziata, the ruling
of opening the judicial winding-up proceeding (sentenza di apertura della liquidazione giudiziale) or the
declaration of the insolvency of the entrepreneur cannot be declared insolvent by the court, provided that the court
revokes the Protective Measures.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to
perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor
anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on
the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application
of the Protective Measures. However, the creditors may suspend the fulfilment of the pending contracts from the
publication of the petition requesting Protective Measures to the obtainment of such Protective Measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), it
must simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said
measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective
Measures will be ineffective.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an
order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the
opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a
maximum of 240 days, given that the judge may discretionary order the revocation of such Protective Measures
or shorten their duration.

During the procedure the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary
management of the company, subject to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to Article 21 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity,
and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments nonconsistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the
economic and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it
appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage
the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the
perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If,
notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate
notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. At the request
of the entrepreneur, one or more creditors or the Expert, the Court that has granted the Protective Measures
and/or Interim Measures may, at any time, revoke such measures or reduce their duration when they do not meet
the aim of ensuring the positive outcome of the negotiations or they appear disproportionate in relation to the
prejudice caused to the creditors, pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code. If the
Protective Measures are revoked, the prohibition of the obtainment of preemption rights by preexisting creditors
ceases to be effective for the date on which the Protective Measure has been revoked.

Pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to
the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the
maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize:

372


-----

a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new supersenior indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code;

b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) via
shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects
provided under Article 2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, without prejudice to Article
2112 of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify
the measures it considers appropriate, taking also into account the requests of the parties
concerned, in order to protect all the interests involved. The court shall also verify the
compliance with the competitiveness principle in choosing the purchaser.

Pursuant to Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della
_crisi d’impresa can terminate as follow:_

a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which
constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 25-bis,
paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such
agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years;

b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of the
Italian Insolvency Code;

c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert,
with the effects provided under Articles 166, paragraph 3, lett. d) and 324. With such
agreement the Expert acknowledges that the reorganization plan (piano di risanamento)
seems to be consistent with the composition of the insolvency and crisis of the entrepreneur.

At the end of the negotiations, if none of the above mentioned agreement is executed, the entrepreneur
may alternatively:

a) file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors
(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Articles 57, 60 and 61 of the Italian
Insolvency Code. The percentage referred to under Article 61, paragraph 2, letter c) of the Italian
Insolvency Code is reduced to 60% if the achievement of the agreement results from the final
report of the Expert.

b) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article
56 of the Italian Insolvency Code;

c) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio
provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code;

d) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code or in
the so-called Prodi-bis procedure or the Marzano procedure;

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 24 of the Italian Insolvency Code:

(i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code
shall maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with
creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-judicial
liquidation composition with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), opening of the judicial
winding-up proceeding (apertura della liquidazione giudiziale), a sanctioned restructuring plan provided
for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code, a compulsory administrative winding-up
(liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies
(amministrazione straordinaria) or simplified pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors
agreement aimed at the liquidation of the debtor’s assets (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione
_del patrimonio) provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code;_

(ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions
and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from

373


-----

claw-back actions pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code if they are
consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery
(risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made;

(iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the
Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 165 and Article 166
of the Italian Insolvency Code if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register
pursuant to Article 21, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code or if the competent court has denied
its authorization pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iv) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the
Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of
recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to
Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain
criminal sanctions.

_Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio_

Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-judicial
liquidation composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio)._

If, in its Final Report, in the context of a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa
proceeding, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome (i.e. the entrepreneur has not
been able to reach an agreement with its creditors) but have been conducted according to fairness and good faith
and that the options provided under Article 23, paragraphs 1 and 2, letter b), of the Italian Insolvency Code are
not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file to the
competent court where the entrepreneur has its center of main interests a petition for admission to the
_concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents_
listed under Article 39 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The petition for _concordato semplificato per la_
_liquidazione del patrimonio_ is then published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing
with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the
Italian Insolvency Code are produced.

Following the filing of such application, the court (i) appoints a so-called “auxiliary” (ausiliario) to,
_inter alia, express an opinion on the entrepreneur’s proposal; (ii) orders that the proposal, together with the_
opinion of the auxiliary and the final report of the expert, be delivered by the debtor to the creditors appearing
on the list filed by the debtor itself; and (iii) sets the date of the hearing for the court approval (omologazione).
Creditors and any third party which has any interests are entitled to object to the court approval (omologazione)
within ten days before the date fixed for the hearing.

If the court, having verified the legitimacy of the objection and the procedure, as well as compliance
with priority creditor claims and the feasibility of the liquidation plan, finds that the proposal does not prejudice
the creditors with respect to the alternative of a judicial winding-up liquidation and that, in any event, it ensures
a benefit to each creditor, it approves the composition with creditors proposal by decree, by which it shall also
appoint a liquidator.

The court issues a decree of approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione
_del patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and_
regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with
preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause
a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the
entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. With the approval decree, the
court also appoints a liquidator.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having
been notified of the same.

Pursuant to Article 25-septies of the Italian Civil Code, the liquidation plan may also include an offer
by a pre-identified third party to transfer the business or one or more branches of the business or specific assets
to such third party, even before the approval: in this case, the judicial liquidator, having verified the absence of
better solutions on the market, may implement the offer.

_Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian_
_Insolvency Code_

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani attestati di
_risanamento) addressed to the creditors and prepared by debtors who are either insolvent or in a state of crisis,_
in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent
expert appointed directly by the debtor and enrolled in the Register of Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro
_dei Revisori Contabili) must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business_
data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the independent expert. The
independent expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the
requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of
misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court reorganization plans and the relevant debt restructuring arrangements are not under any
form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or
supervising authority. Also, Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and
consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided they are finalized at restructuring
the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. However, the possibility to adopt such tools
to liquidate the debtor is disputed, as it is argued they shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s
indebtedness and the rebalancing its financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-judicial
liquidation agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not
offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party
creditors. The Italian Insolvency Code provides that, should these plans fail, and the debtor be declared insolvent,
the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted on the debtor’s assets for the implementation
of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to any claw-back action (azione
_revocatoria), including the claw-back action provided for pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, as_
provided for pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (b) are exempted
from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in
the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register of the plan, the report by
the independent expert and the arrangements is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax
benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court
pre-judicial liquidation agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the reorganization plan (or the
agreements entered into to implement it) is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it cannot be
excluded that the abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of subsequent judicial
winding-up, if the competent court were to assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it was
certified by the independent expert.

Unlike Italian Bankruptcy Law, Italian Insolvency Law sets forth specific rules regarding Out-of-court
reorganization plans and the relevant restructuring arrangements entered into with creditors, which must be
followed for the plans and agreements to grant protection against claw-back actions and potential civil and
criminal responsibilities. More in detail, out-of-court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian
Insolvency Code must be supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and commercial
situation of the debtor and which also needs to indicate, among others, the causes of the crisis and the new
resources which will be made available to the debtor and the industrial plan. Moreover, they must be suitable for
the purpose of assuring the restructuring of the indebtedness of the debtor and rebalancing its financial position
and, in case of its failure and subsequent challenge (impugnazione) before an Italian court, it must not be
deemed as being unreasonable.

_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 57 of_
_the Italian Insolvency Code_

Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) provided for
pursuant to Article 57 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code may be entered into by the debtor with creditors
holding at least 60% of the outstanding indebtedness, to be sanctioned (omologato) by the competent court. An
independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data
provided by the company and declare and that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that
the indebtedness vis-à-vis non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms in a 120day term from: (i) the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts
which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of

375


-----

the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of
debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the sanctioning
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian Insolvency
Code, only a debtor who is insolvent or facing a state of crisis (as described above) can initiate this process and
request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its
publication. Creditors and other interested parties may challenge the agreement within 30 days from the
publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled with the opposition (if any), the
court will validate (omologare) the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 30 days of its
publication pursuant to Article 51 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

The Italian Insolvency Code does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of
the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the debtor or a third party
carrying out the business, or the sale of the business, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write
offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement
for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Article 58, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code sets
the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan. More precisely, in the event of substantial
amendments to the plan before the approval, the report issued by the expert and the consent to the debt
restructuring agreement expressed by creditors shall be renewed. The report shall also be renewed in the event of
substantial amendment. In the event of substantial amendments after the approval, the debtor shall make such
amendments as are appropriate to ensure the implementation of the agreements, by requesting the update of the
certified report issued by the expert having the requirements set forth in Article 57, paragraph 4 of the Italian
Insolvency Code. In this case, the renewed certified report, together with the amended restructuring plan, shall
be published in the companies’ register, giving appropriate notice to the creditors by registered letter or by
certified email (PEC). The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30
days after having been notified of the same.

_The key features of a debt restructuring agreement_

With the petition for the approval by the court of the debt restructuring agreement (or at any time pending
the procedure) the debtor may request to be granted any Measures (e.g. a stay of actions or the creation by creditors
of security interest (unless it is agreed in the debt restructuring agreement) in relation to pre-existing debts, etc.).
Such Measures can also be requested (i) pursuant to Article 54, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, to
the court by the debtor pending negotiations with creditors (i.e., prior to the filing of the petition for approval
of the agreement), subject to certain conditions, or (ii) pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code,
together with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency
Code. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for approval
of the debt restructuring agreement includes the relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of
the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the
conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). No
dispossession of debtor occurs in respect of a debt restructuring agreement, but the court may appoint a judicial
commissioner to oversee the proceedings and must do so in case petitions for the opening of judicial liquidation
are pending, when it is necessary for the protection of the parties who filed such petitions. It is a court-supervised
procedure, which can take from a few months up to more than a year (the duration of the proceedings are
generally influenced by challenges). Creditors entering into the debt restructuring agreement are not required
to receive the same treatment (i.e., they are free to reject the proposal and to protect their interests otherwise)
and no cram-down is applicable to third-party non-adhering creditors, who shall be fully re-paid within 120
days from validation (omologa) of the debt restructuring agreement (if the claims are already due and payable
at such date) or within 120 days from the respective maturity date if such creditors’ claims are not yet due as of
the validation date of such debt restructuring agreement as per respectively Article 57, paragraph 3 letters a) and
b).

The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a
hearing to be held no earlier of 15 days from the notification of the relevant filing. Pending such deadline,
creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the approval. At such hearing, the court decides
upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for the approval are met.

Pursuant to the Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code, debtors are entitled to enter into debt
restructuring agreement by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging
to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their status and economic interests) and can request the

376


-----

court to declare that agreement binding on the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category (so called
“cram down”).

More in detail, debt restructuring agreements with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione ad
_efficacia estesa) provided pursuant to Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code- which were previously only_
permitted in relation to debts owed to banks and financial intermediaries where such debts represented at least
50% of the total indebtedness - can now be applied to any category of creditors, provided that, inter alia: (i) all
the creditors belonging to the same category have been informed of the start of the negotiations and have been
able to participate in them in good faith and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s
assets, economic and financial situation as well as on the restructuring agreement and its effects; (ii) the agreement
provides for the continuation of the business activity either directly or indirectly pursuant to Article 84 of the
Italian Insolvency Code; (iii) the claims of the consenting creditors belonging to a same category represent at least
75% of all the claims belonging to the same category; (iv) the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same
category to which the effects of the agreement are extended can be satisfied under the agreement for an amount
not lower than the amount they would receive with the judicial liquidation being understood that a creditor may
hold claims in more than one category; and (v) the debtor has notified the agreement, the application for court
approval and the documents attached thereto to the creditors to be crammed down. The percentage of 75% is
lowered to 60% if the debt restructuring agreement is referred to in the Final Report issued by the Expert at the
end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa.

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 61, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, a special
provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this
situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and
financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects
of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement
is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going
concern. However, in such case the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid.

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a standstill agreement
(convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and its creditors representing 75% of the same class
would also bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the
requirements provided under Article 62, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code has been appointed and
certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily
regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii) the fact that the treatment reserved to non-adhering creditors is at least
equal to the one they could obtain in the context of a judicial winding up, and (B) certain further conditions are
met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the
negotiations, have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date
information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects).
Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having
been notified of the same.

In no case debt restructuring agreements provided for under Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code
and standstill agreements provided under Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code may impose on the nonadhering creditors, _inter alia, performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the_
maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities.

Furthermore, Article 60 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the so called facilitated debt
restructuring agreement (“accordi di ristrutturazione agevolati”). Such proceeding, is a particular kind of debt
restructuring agreement which may be entered into with creditors representing as little as 30% of the total
indebtedness (instead of the 60% generally required under Article 57, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency
Code) provided that the debtor: (i) has waived the standstill on the payment of non-consenting creditors (usually
provided for by law, for a period of 120 days from the court approval of the agreement or from the maturity date
of the relevant obligations, in “ordinary” restructuring agreements); and (ii) has not previously requested to the
court the granting of protective interim measures on the its assets.

By virtue of Article 59 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to
the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their
claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii)
debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce
effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such
shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors.

The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement
and to the court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below.

Pursuant to Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a composition with creditors on a
going concern basis:

a) the debtor may repay, in accordance with the relevant contractual terms, the installments due
under a loan agreement which is secured by way of a security interest over the assets used in
the business, provided that: (a) at the date of the filing of the application for admission to the
composition with creditors, the debtor has fulfilled its obligations or the court authorizes the
payment of the debt for principal and interest due at that date; and (b) the expert meeting the
requirements set forth in Article 52, paragraph 3, of the Italian Insolvency Code certifies (i) that
such payments are essential for the continuation of the business activity and functional to
ensuring the best satisfaction of the creditors (as already required by Article 100 of the Italian
Insolvency Code) and, (ii) that the secured claims can be fully satisfied with the proceeds of the
liquidation of the asset carried out at market value and that the repayment of the installments
due does not prejudice the rights of the other creditors;

b) the court may authorize payment of the remuneration due, for the months preceding the filing
of the application for the composition with creditors, to the workers employed in the business
whose continuation is envisaged under the plan.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 73 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in case of revocation of the approval
(omologa), the court, upon the debtor's petition, shall order the conversion to a judicial winding-up procedure. If
the revocation results from acts of fraud (atti in frode ai creditori) or non-performance of the obligations arising
under the debt restructuring agreement, the petition for conversion may also be proposed by creditors or by the
public prosecutor. In case of conversion, the court shall grant additional time to the debtor aimed at supplementing
the documentation and shall act in accordance with Article 270 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

_Court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (as defined above) and that has not been declared
insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in
order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of
insolvency and the initiation of insolvency proceedings (so called “concordato preventivo”). Such composition
proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets
(attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years,
(ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding
fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess (included debts not yet due) of €0.5 million. Only the debtor
can file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo with the court based in the location of the debtor’s
main office. The debtor must file the petition together with, among others, a restructuring plan containing an
analytic description of manner and timing of the fulfillment of the proposal and an independent expert report
assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data
provided by the company). The petition for _concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the_
company’s register by the registry of the court and communicated to the public prosecutor. From the date of such
publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, preexisting creditors cannot obtain
security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date
on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against
such pre-existing creditors. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that
the petition for the admission to the concordato proceedings includes the relevant request for Measures, from the
date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the
enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant
Measures). As already described with reference to debt restructuring agreements, at any time pending the
proceedings, the debtor may request to be granted Measures, which can also be requested pursuant to Article 44
of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided
for by the Italian Insolvency Code.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring
and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment
of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of
the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale), including through extraordinary transactions, such as

378


-----

the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds
convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver
(assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of
creditors into classes (which is mandatory in certain cases provided under the Article 85 of the Italian Insolvency
Code), provided that each class is composed of creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic
interests; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may
also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Save for the provisions
provided for under Article 109 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 86 of the Italian Insolvency Code has
provided that, in the context of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis (concordato con continuità),
the plan may provide for a standstill for the secured creditors, which may extend up to six months from the date
of sanctioning (omologa) of the composition with creditors proposal for the payment of secured creditors
(creditori privilegiati) pursuant to Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code (i.e. employees, professionals etc.).

Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 4, the Italian Insolvency Code, in order to strengthen the position of
the unsecured creditors, a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio)
(i.e., a composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such
assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that (i) with the relevant filing for such
proceeding, external resources are contributed which increase the assets available at the time of such filing by
at least 10% and (ii) the degraded secured creditors as well as unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage equal
to 20% of their total claims. In this respect, it should be noted that resources contributed for the purpose of a
composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) may be distributed
notwithstanding the provisions set forth under Articles 2740 and 2741 of the Italian Civil Code provided that such
distribution complies with the 20% requirement set forth above. Resources contributed are considered as
“external” when provided for any reason by the debtor’s shareholders without obligation of repayment or
subordination, in relation to which the plan provides them to be for the sole benefit of the creditors. This provision
does not apply to composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern
(concordato con continuità aziendale).

Under the composition with creditors, there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly retains
management powers under the supervision of a court-appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and the deputy
judge. From the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato
_preventivo, the debtor is entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its business, although extraordinary_
transactions require the prior written approval of the court. Provided that the abovementioned steps are taken,
during this time, all enforcement actions, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors,
whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. The accrual of interests is suspended for the same timeframe, except for
claims secured by pledges, liens or mortgages. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless
authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for
the _concordato preventivo_ is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing
creditors. Any act, payment or security executed or created after the filing of the _concordato preventivo_
application and in accordance with its rules and procedures is exempt from claw-back action. The debtor is also
exempt from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 322, third paragraph (“preferential bankruptcy”),
and 323 (“simple bankruptcy”) of the Italian Insolvency Code, in relation to acts and payments made in execution
of the Composition with Creditors and/or in relation to finance provided under Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency
Code upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company have
super senior priority (prededucibilità) in the event of a subsequent judicial winding-up (see Statutory priorities
below).

For details regarding super senior financing, please refer to the paragraph relating to debt restructuring
agreements.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary
and simplified petition pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code. For sake of clarity, under Italian
Insolvency Code, the simplified petition may be utilised by the debtor also to access a debt restructuring agreement
or a restructuring plan subject to approval by the court (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) or a
_concordato. The debtor company may file such petition, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the_
proposal and all relevant documentation (or the debt restructuring agreement, or the restructuring plan) within a
period assigned by the court (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition,
subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such
extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial winding-up proceeding are not pending.
If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may, among other things: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner
(commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the

379


-----

activities under Article 106 of the Italian Insolvency Code (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to
report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will
report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a _concordato_
_preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned_
period. As mentioned above, filing the simplified petition, the debtor may request the application of Measures.

Pursuant to Article 44, paragraph 1, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the decree setting the term
for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to
the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the
application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse
of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the simplified petition being declared inadmissible
and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified,
in the adjudication of the distressed company into judicial winding-up. If the activities carried out by the debtor
company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the “full” application, the court may, ex officio,
after hearing the debtor and if appointed the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional
documents. Following the filing of the simplified petition and until the decree of admission to the composition
with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the
court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims
arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of the concordato preventivo
petition (including preliminary petition) have super priority (prededucibilità) in case of a subsequent judicial
winding-up.

The concordato preventivo proposal may also provide, inter alia: (i) the continuation of the business
by the debtor as going concern; or (ii) the transfer of the business to one or more companies (concordato con
_continuità aziendale) as well as for a particular composition with creditors proceeding through which any assets_
that are no longer necessary to run the business of the company are liquidated (concordato misto). According to
Article 84, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the _concordato misto qualifies as a_ _concordato con_
_continuità aziendale, regardless the “portion” of business for which going concern is envisaged. In these cases,_
the plan and the petition for the concordato preventivo must fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected
as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and
support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation
of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition
proposal was not implemented. Existing contracts, even if entered with governmental bodies, are automatically
not to be terminated by admission to procedure.

Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the
winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also
contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Under Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a debtor who files for a concordato pursuant to Articles
44 and 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code based on business continuity may request the court to be authorized
to pay pre-filing claims relating to the purchase of goods or services if an independent expert certifies that they
are essential for business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato)
to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and schedules a specific
period of time during which creditors can express their vote. During the implementation of the proposal, the
company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is
supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the
ordinary course of business).

Article 91 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, if the composition with creditors’ plan, includes
an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party,
the court or the delegated judge shall order that for appropriate publicity to be given to the offer itself in order to
acquire competing offers (offerte concorrenti). If expressions of interest are received, the court or the delegated
judge, by decree, shall order the opening of the competitive proceeding. Furthermore pursuant to Article 91,
paragraph 4, the judicial decree referred above establishes the procedures for the submission of irrevocable offers,
providing that in all cases, among others, the following is ensured: (a) their comparability, (b) the requirements

380


-----

for the participation of the bidders, (c) the forms and timing of access to relevant information, (d) any limits on
their use, (e) the manner in which the judicial commissioner must provide them to those who request them, (f) the
manner in which the competitive procedure is to be conducted, (g) the minimum increase in the consideration to
be provided by the subsequent offers, (h) the guarantees to be given by the bidders, (i) the forms of publicity, and
(l) the date of the hearing for the evaluation of the bids if the sale takes place before the court. With the sale or
with the assignment, whichever is earlier, to a person other than the original bidder identified in the plan, the latter
and the debtor are released from their obligations towards each other and accordingly the debtor shall amend the
proposal and plan in accordance with the outcome of the competitive proceeding.

The concordato preventivo is voted on within the period of time scheduled by the court and must be
approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to
vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, or (b) the majority of the
receivables admitted to vote is reached the majority of the classes. Pursuant to Article 109, paragraph 1, of the
Italian Insolvency Code, in case one creditor holds more than the majority of receivables admitted to voting, it is
also necessary to reach majority by headcount. The _concordato preventivo_ is approved only if the required
majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting right
will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes
in the _concordato_ proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with
respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to
vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in
meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law
has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest as could be the
case of disenfranchised noteholders to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote,
albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo
unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive
full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent
expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. Among
others, (i) the companies controlling the debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control of the entity
controlling the debtor, (ii) the assignees of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the assignment has been
perfected during the year preceding the concordato and (iii) creditors in conflict of interest are excluded from
voting. The court may approve the _concordato preventivo_ (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more
classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of
the non-adhering creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions (in particular
in comparison with the judicial liquidation). If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo
is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a nonadhering class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the _concordato preventivo_ if it deems that
the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo
than would otherwise be the case (including the judicial winding-up).

The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by
the social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when their positive
vote is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 109, paragraph 1 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, also on the basis of the result of the report of the independent expert referred to in Article 88 of
the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared
to a judicial liquidation scenario.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 90 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the possibility for
creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor)
holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan (proposta concorrente)
to the debtor’s plan - within 30 days prior from the related creditors’ vote on the debtor’s plan - in a court
supervised composition with creditors proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being
met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least 30% of the
unsecured claims (crediti chirografari), considering also that such percentage is reduced to 20% in case the
debtor has filed for a composizione negoziata provided for pursuant to Article 13 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

Differently from the general rules set out above, pursuant to Article 109 paragraph 5 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, the composition with creditors on a going-concern basis (concordato con continuità), is
approved if all the creditors' classes vote in favor of such composition with creditors arrangement. In each class,
the relevant composition with creditors’ proposal is approved if the majority of the claims allowed to vote is
reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted favorably, provided that the
creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted. In case of non-approval, Article

381


-----

112, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code shall apply. In this respect, it should be noted that secured
creditors shall not vote if their claims are satisfied in cash, in full, within 180 days from the sanctioning (omologa)
of the concordato con continuità and provided that the security interests supporting the related claims remains
firm until the winding-up, functional to their satisfaction. In case of claims of employees or other claims secured
under Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code, the delay is reduced to 30 days from the approval by the court.

Pursuant to Article 112, paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, after the approval of the concordato
_preventivo_ proposal, non-adhering creditors (or creditors belonging to a non-adhering class) representing 20%
or more of the liabilities may file an opposition (opposizione), challenging the economic convenience of the
plan. In such case, the court has the authority to “cram-down” non-adhering creditors, compelling their
acceptance of the plan, if it deems that the proposed treatment of their claims is equivalent to what they would
recover in a judicial winding-up scenario. After the creditors’ approval, the court approves the composition with
creditors and appoints one or more liquidators in order to execute the approved plan if it has to be realized
by way of a transfer of assets. The court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement
the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required.

Pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the creditors do not approve the concordato
_preventivo, the delegated judge (giudice delegato) shall promptly inform the court which, having decided that the_
appropriate conditions apply, shall declare the opening of the judicial winding-up proceeding.

The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time to
time, by the debtor are not automatically affected by the _concordato preventivo_ proceeding and normally
continue pending the procedure, any agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to Article
97 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate
outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti) if the continuation of such
agreements is inconsistent with the prospects and the execution of the composition with creditors’ plan, except
for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements
(rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di
_vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di_
_immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the_
_concordato preventivo_ or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the
procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time _(a)_
between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further
extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) or in the
event where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are pending, renewable just once. When the composition
proposal together with the relevant plan have been submitted, the suspension may also be authorized by the court
for a further duration, which, however, may not exceed thirty days from the date of the decree opening the
procedure, which may not be further extended. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an
indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification
would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the concordato preventivo procedure.

Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the
composition with creditors plan or fraud, provided that the relevant requirements are met, the concordato can be
terminated or annulled, as the case may be, upon petition of one or more of the creditors and the judicial windingup may follow, at the behest of the relevant court. if the composition with creditors is implemented, terms and
conditions of payments are amended as per the _concordato_ proposal, and the debtor may return to its usual
operations (if the assets of the company are still in his possession). Concordato preventivo is compulsory for all
creditors prior to the publication of the application in the companies’ register. However, creditors retain without
prejudice their rights against co-debtors and guarantors of the debtor.

In case of non-minor breaches, the concordato may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial
commissioner (in case of petition by one or more of the creditors). The relevant lawsuit must be brought within
one year from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the concordato itself.
The concordato may also be annulled upon request of the judicial commissioner or of one or more creditors in
case a portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the liabilities have been willfully exaggerated. The
relevant lawsuit must be brought within six months from the discovery of the concealment/exaggeration and, in
any event, within two years from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the
_concordato itself._

_Available financing forms under the Italian Insolvency Code_

382


-----

The enactment of the Italian Insolvency Code did not change the main features of the previous legal
framework set out in the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The aim at preserving the value of the company as a going
concern and maximizing creditor’s repayment are the main goals both of the previous legal framework and the
Italian Insolvency Code.

However, the new provisions under the Italian Insolvency Code remove some uncertainties and clarifies
some debated issues.

In addition, the provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law focused mainly on the perspective of
creditors already having claims against the company to avoid that the expectations of recovery of such claims
were reduced due to the potential considerable increase in predeductible claims and, to this extent, granted a
preeminent role to the independent expert together with the court authorization procedures. Unlike the former
legal framework, the new provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code focus more on preserving the business value
of the distressed company as a going concern by strengthening the key role of the financing of the debtor in the
context of the relevant proceedings.

The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement
and to the court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo).

The main features of the provisions concerning different available financings under the Italian Insolvency
Code are set out below.

_Interim financing - Article 99 Paragraph 1 to 4 Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring
transactions on a going concern basis, also in cases in which business continuity is maintained exclusively in a
view of liquidation, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement
pursuant to Article 57 (or Article 60 or 61) of the Italian Insolvency Code or a petition pursuant to Article 87 of
the Italian Insolvency Code (in relation to the court-supervised composition with creditors procedure described
below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure
such indebtedness, subject to the court’s authorization with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning
claims, provided that: (i) the petition specifies (A) the purpose of the financing; (B) that the debtor is unable to
otherwise obtain the required funds and (C) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and
irreparable prejudice to the going concern or to the proceedings; and (ii) the expert appointed by the debtor,
having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the
new financing are functional to the continuity of the business activities until the sanctioning (omologa) of the
relevant insolvency proceedings or to the opening of the proceedings or to conduct them and, in any case, are
aimed at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors. The expert report is not necessary in case the
court recognizes that there is the urgent need to avoid an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern.
In the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up proceeding (liquidazione
_giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case_
the petition or the expert report contain false data or omit important information or in case the debtor performed
acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available
such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

_Bridge Financings - Article 99 Paragraph 5 Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, financings (together with the related
claims) granted, in any form, in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione)
of a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)
(finanza ponte), may be granted such priority status provided that (i) they meet the requirements of Article 99,
paragraphs 1 and 2 (described above), and (ii) it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such
priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the approval of the _concordato preventivo. The_
indebtedness under such financing option may be secured, subject to the court’s authorization, with in rem security
(garanzie reali), or by assigning claims.

_Implementation financing - Article 101 Italian Insolvency Code_

In restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, pursuant to Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency
Code, any financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised
pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors) sanctioned by the competent court and expressly provided

383


-----

for in the relevant plan, enjoy super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent judicial
liquidation, save for the below (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80%
of such financing, unless the lender has become a shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt
restructuring agreement or of the supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors, as in such case the
priority status is afforded to 100% of the financing) according with the provisions set forth in Article 221 of
Italian Insolvency Code. In the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial winding-up
proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status
(prededucibilità) in case the composition plan or the debt restructuring agreement, on the basis of an assessment
to be made at the time of the relevant filing, results to be based upon false data or omission of relevant information
or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver
proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date
of the disbursement.

_The shareholders' financing – Art. 102 Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Art. 102, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code super senior ranking status also applies
to any financings made available by shareholders in any form (including any guarantee facility or granting
counter-indemnities) up to 80% of their amount.

Paragraph 2 of Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code clarifies that, to the extent the financing is
made available by an entity becoming a shareholder in the context of and by way of implementation of a
composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement, all the claims deriving from such financings benefit
of super senior ranking status and the 80% threshold limitation set out in Paragraph 1 does not apply.

_Super senior ranking - Art. 99 Paragraph 6 and 101 Paragraph 2 Corporate Crisis and Insolvency Code_

Super senior ranking (prededucibilità) of the claims is the most relevant feature of bridge financings,
interim financings and implementation financings as described in the paragraphs above.

Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the claims deriving from such financings are
expressly qualified as super senior by law and by Article 6(2) of the Italian Insolvency Code which clarifies that
their super senior ranking natures continues in the context of any subsequent insolvency or enforcement
proceedings (including in a judicial liquidation or any so-called minor proceedings).

As already explained above, super senior ranking nature of such financings will be excluded in case of
acts of fraud (which may be relevant also in the context of debt restructuring agreements).

Such limit to super senior ranking is regulated differently for interim financings and bridge financings
on the one side and for the implementation financings on the other side.

More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant
information are relevant when found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or the
attestation of the independent expert, whilst for implementation financings such elements are relevant when on
included in plan underlying the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement.

With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, Article 99 Paragraph 6 of the Italian
Insolvency Code provides that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation, such financings (although
authorized by the court in the context of the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement) do
not benefit from super senior ranking when it is proved (jointly) that:

a) the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant information, or
when the debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization; and

b) the receiver proves that the entities who provided the financing, at the date of issuance, knew the
aforementioned circumstances.

With reference to implementation financings, the relevant provisions are set out in Article 101 Paragraph
2 of the Italian Insolvency Code providing that such financings do not benefit from the super senior ranking, in
case of the opening of a judicial liquidation (alternatively):

384


-----

a) when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the petition for the opening of the
proceeding, the plan underlying the composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement
turns out to be based on false data or on the omission of relevant information; or

b) when the debtor has carried out acts of fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that the
lenders providing the financings were aware of such circumstances at the time of the establishment
of the financings.

_Restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione)_

An important novelty concerns the crisis regulation procedures governed by Title IV of Part I of the
Italian Insolvency Code, is the new figure of the restructuring plan subject to homologation _(piano di_
_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) (the so-called “PRO”, the rules of which are set out in the new Articles_
64-bis and 64-ter of the Italian Insolvency Code).

This new tool, takes the form of a restructuring framework that may disregard the distribution rules of
regular insolvency proceedings but can be enacted provided that strict requirements are met. In this regard, it
should be noted that recourse to this instrument will be reserved for a debtor in crisis or insolvent that plans to
satisfy its creditors by dividing them into classes according to homogeneous legal positions and economic
interests. This instrument allows the plan’s proceeds to be distributed even in derogation of the principle of “par
_condicio creditorum” (i.e. the equal treatment of creditors), provided that the proposal is approved by unanimous_
consent of the classes. A judgement of admissibility is provided for by the court, which is called upon to assess
the proposal’s timeliness and to verify the correctness of the class formation criteria.

Application for the approval by the court of a restructuring plan must follow the steps of the common
framework applicable to all restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e. concordato preventivo, debt restructuring
agreement and also to judicial winding-up). The regulation of the restructuring plan subject to homologation
(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), from the date of submission of the application until its
approval, is based on the model of the negotiated crisis settlement: the entrepreneur maintains the ordinary and
extraordinary management of the company in the prevailing interest of the creditors under the supervision of the
court commissioner. The debtor is, in any case, allowed to amend the application at any time, formulating the
proposal of composition (concordato preventivo). In that case, the time limit for approval is shortened. Similarly,
the debtor that has filed an application for composition with creditors may amend the application by applying for
approval of the restructuring plan provided that the application is made before voting commences. In each class,
the proposal is approved if a majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the
claims of the voting creditors have voted in favor, provided that creditors holding at least half of the total claims
of the same class have voted. The court will approve the restructuring plan in the event of approval by all classes.
If a dissenting creditor objects to the proposal, the court will approve and homologate the restructuring plan if the
proposal satisfies the claim to a not lesser extent than the one resulting from a judicial liquidation. A creditor that
has not objected to the lack of convenience in its observations may not file an objection referred before, unless it
proves such the lack of objection was due to a cause not attributable to it. In summary the restructuring plan
subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) thus represents for the debtor an
opportunity instrument which minimizes the admissibility phase, providing greater freedom of action, but
requiring the approval of all classes of creditors in order to be effectively approved.

Against the judgment of the court ruling on the approval of the restructuring plan subject to homologation
_(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal to the competent court of_
appeal within the term of 30 days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court.

_Court-supervised composition for small debtors_

The Italian Insolvency Code provides for a simplified court-supervised composition in case the debtor
does not meet the dimensional requirements to access other restructuring tools.

Procedural steps and effects do essentially mimic those of the concordato preventivo, but it entails the
involvement of the board for crisis settlement (organismo di risoluzione della crisi), which assists the debtor in
preparing the paperwork and filing the petition, and performs the activities and duties which, in a concordato
_preventivo are prerogatives of the judicial commissioner._

_Judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale)_

The judicial winding-up (liquidazione giudiziale) is a court-supervised procedure for the liquidation of
an insolvent company’s assets and for the distribution of the related proceeds. It results in the company’s
liquidation. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also evidenced by defaults
and/or external elements, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come
due.

The judicial winding-up is declared by the competent court and is applicable only to commercial
enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets
(attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years;
(ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three
preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million.
Pursuant to Article 37 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the request to commence the judicial liquidation of the
debtor company’s assets can be filed by (i) the debtor company itself, (ii) the administrative bodies and
authorities that have control and supervisory functions over the company, (iii) by one or more of the debtor’s
creditors and (iv) in certain cases, by the public prosecutor.

Upon the commencement of judicial winding-up proceedings, amongst other things:

    - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within
a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against
the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as secured claims. Secured claims are paid
out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding
balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured
debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from
the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the judicial receiver and the creditors’
committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in
its decision;

    - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as
their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of
liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant
expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits,
any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s
other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization.
After hearing the judicial receiver (curatore) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether
to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or her decision;

    - the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments made
or received by the insolvent debtor are immediately suspended and formalities with third parties that
have been carried out after the declaration of insolvency are not effective as regards the creditors of
the debtor (Article 145 of Italian Insolvency Code);

    - the debtor is dispossessed, and the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are
transferred to the judicial receiver (curatore). The debtor may no longer validly act in court as
claimant or defendant in relation to the assets (Article 142 of the Italian Insolvency Code). The
judicial receiver is vested with such powers upon the authorization of the delegated judge. However,
all pending proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically stayed from the date the
adjudication is issued and need to be re-initiated by or against the judicial receiver;

    - the beginning of the judicial winding-up involves the cessation of all the activities of the company
with a view to a sale of all assets. However, continuation of business may be authorized by the court
if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors. If the competent
court authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa), the
management of the business is entrusted to the judicial receiver (who may in turn avail himself of
qualified third parties for this purpose);

    - certain payments made, security interests given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a certain
period before the debtor’s submission to a judicial winding-up procedure (varying from six months

386


-----

to two years) can be set aside and clawed back if certain conditions are met (provided for pursuant
to Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code);

    - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in
certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other
than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and

    - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the insolvency
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general
rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or
all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific
rules expressly provided for the Italian Insolvency Code.

In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a
written petition requiring the Court to give the judicial receiver (curatore) a deadline of no more than 60 days;
within such deadline, the receiver must decide to enter into the agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration
of the deadline without the judicial receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement
is deemed terminated. Although the general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to terminate contracts
where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules
expressly provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code.

Judicial winding-up proceedings, as per the former bankruptcy proceedings under Italian Bankruptcy
Law, are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed judicial receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and
a creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori). The judicial receiver is not a representative of the creditors,
and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds
from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can
take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate property.

Furthermore, the parties of a judicial winding-up proceeding as well as any interested party, may file
an appeal (opposizione) to the decree closing the judicial winding-up proceeding within 30 days after having been
notified of the same.

   - **Composition with creditors in judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale).**
Pursuant to Article 240 of the Italian Insolvency Code, judicial liquidation proceedings can
terminate prior to the actual judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) of the debtor, through
a proposal for a composition with creditors in judicial liquidation. By way of preliminary note,
such agreement occurring in the context of a judicial liquidation proceeding (i) replaced the
former proceeding defined as “concordato fallimentare”, a composition with creditors
agreement occurring in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding (fallimento) formerly provided
for under Article 124, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (ii) should be kept distinct
from the concordato preventivo, which is an independent insolvency proceeding. This particular
composition with creditor agreement arrangement benefits in a certain way both the debtor as
well as the creditors, in fact while the former is released of the debts falling into the relevant
plan also regaining free disposal of his assets, the latter is satisfied faster and to a greater extent
than they would have been with the full completion of the judicial liquidation process pertaining
to the debtor’s assets.

The creditor, a third party or the debtor himself formulates a proposal having as its object a
“plan” to satisfy creditors, including preferential creditors, in full or in part. In case the
_concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is proposed by the debtor, such proposal, inter alia, (i)_
shall be filed after 1 year from the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding and (ii) shall
provide for the contribution by the debtor of resources that increase the value of the debtor’s
assets by at least 10%.

Such proposal shall be submitted to the competent judge, shall then be approved by the creditors
and finally by the court. In case the court’s decree approving the concordato nella liquidazione
_giudiziale becomes final (definitivo), the court declares the judicial liquidation to be closed and_
terminated, initiating the enactment phase of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale. In the
context of a concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale, the competent court supervises both the
proposal and execution phases while the judicial receiver (curatore), once the liquidation is
closed, loses his management functions and retains only supervisory duties over the fulfillment
of the terms and the conditions of the arrangement obligations arising from or in connection with

387


-----

the aforementioned concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale.

Pursuant to Article 240, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal may provide
for:

(i) the division of creditors into classes, according to homogeneous legal position and
economic interests.

Under the relevant provision, such division is not mandatory but discretionary, provided
two criteria for the class identification: (a) legal position, i.e., the nature of the claim, e.g.,
unsecured or preferential and (b) the homogeneous economic interests. In this respect, the
Italian Insolvency Code requires for the criteria and rationale for the division into classes
to be expressly stated in order to avoid the distorted use of class formation, put in place
for the sole purpose of obtaining the approval of the abovementioned proposal;

(ii) differential treatment between creditors belonging to different classes, indicating the
reasons of such differences;

(iii) the restructuring of the financial indebtedness of the debtor as well as the satisfaction of
claims in any form possible, by way of example:

a) by assignment of assets;

b) by assumption (accollo);

c) by means of other extraordinary transactions, including the assignment to creditors
(as well as to companies in which they have an interest), of shares, quotas or bonds,
including those convertible into shares or other financial instruments and debt
securities.

It should be noted that a special feature of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is the
option to provide that secured creditors may not be satisfied in full. However, it is necessary for
the plan to provide for their satisfaction to a non-lesser extent than that the one which can be
realized, by reason of preferential placement, from the relevant proceeds in the event of a judicial
liquidation, having regard to the market value attributable to the assets or rights over which the
cause of pre-emption exists.

The _concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale_ proposal must be approved by the creditors’
committee and the creditors holding the simple majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are
formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in the majority of the classes). However, in the
event of dissent by more than one creditor’s class, a cram-down may occur (i.e. in case the court
decides to approve the concordato - despite a creditor belonging to a dissenting class contests
the appropriateness of the proposal - if it finds that the claims can be satisfied by the concordato
to a non-lesser extent than the practicable alternatives. Final court confirmation and sanctioning
(omologazione) is also required.

Finally, once approved and sanctioned (omologato) by the court the concordato nella liquidazione
_giudiziale_ is mandatory:

(i) for all existing creditors prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding; and

(ii) for creditors who have not applied for the admission to the judicial liquidation estate, to
whom the guarantees or the security interests given in the concordato nella liquidazione
_giudiziale by third parties do not extend._

With the termination of the judicial liquidation - as a consequence of the sanctioning decree
(decreto di omologa), which pursuant to Article 247 of the Italian Insolvency Code may be
challenged and appealed within 30 days from its notification - the debtor returns “in bonis” and
enjoys the renewed availability of its assets.

- **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Insolvency Code**
may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU
jurisdictions. The proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i)
for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such
as costs related to the procedure) as better identified in Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code;
(ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for
the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after

388


-----

the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia,
a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the
claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee
wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured
creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not
exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi)
and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale
of the debtor’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the
court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by
subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence
it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor
contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian judicial liquidation estate to
the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of
claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire
debtor’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

In particular, pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in addition to claims expressly
qualified as “prededucibili” under Italian law, among others, the following claims are
“prededucibili”:

(i) claims relating to expenses and fees for services rendered by the business crisis settlement
body;

(ii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing for the approval of a
restructuring plan subject to homologation, the debt restructuring agreements and for the
application for protective measures, to the extent of 75% of the assessed claim and provided
that the abovementioned plan or agreements are approved and homologated;

(iii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing of for a court supervised
composition with creditors procedure as well as the filing of the related proposal and the
plan accompanying it, within the limits of 75% of the ascertained claims and provided that
the proceedings are opened pursuant to Article 47 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iv) claims legally arisen in connection with insolvency proceedings for the management of the
debtor’s assets and the continuation of the business of the company as well as arising from
the professional services required by the related bodies.

- **Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Italian Insolvency Code is**
the equal treatment of all creditors (“par condicio creditorum”), according to which, absent
statutory priorities or security right, no creditor may be paid a higher percentage of his claim than
other creditors. A consequence of this principle is not only that the payment of debts by the judicial
receiver is strictly regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor over the
previous year (or, in certain cases, over the previous six months) are scrutinized and potentially
unwound as preferential.

Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian
law that may give rise, _inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security_
interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of insolvency. The key avoidance provisions
include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential transactions
and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are
normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in judicial winding-up compared
to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In insolvency proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Insolvency Code provides
for a claw-back period of up to two years (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year
ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration
procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain
circumstances. The Italian Insolvency Code distinguishes between acts or transactions which are
ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the
judicial receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

- **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code,**
subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective
_vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the_

389


-----

opening of the judicial winding-up procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of
such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to
Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of
law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding,
without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any
interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law,
and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due
on the day of the of the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they
were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the
winding-up proceeding or in the prior two-year period ; and (B) payments made by the debtor with
respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or
after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are
ineffective vis-à-vis creditors.

   - **Acts that may be avoided at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner. The**
following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be
clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the debtor as provided for by Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency
Code and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or
constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

(i) onerous transactions carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial
liquidation proceeding or in the previous year, where the value of the debt or the obligations
undertaken by the debtor exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or
promised to the debtor;

(ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor which were not paid in cash or
by other customary means of payment which were carried out after the filing followed by
the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year;

(iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the
judicial liquidation proceeding or in the year prior, in order to secure pre-existing debts
which were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and

(iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the
judicial liquidation proceeding or in the six months prior in order to secure pre-existing
debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted.

Furthermore, payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions
and/or granting of priority rights/security interests for debts simultaneously created (event those of third parties)
may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective, if the judicial receiver proves that the other party knew
of the debtor’s state of insolvency and if made by the debtor after the filing of the petition followed by the opening
of the judicial liquidation or during the prior six months.

The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

(i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to
market practice;

(ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce
the entity’s debt towards the bank;

(iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the
Italian Civil Code, in force as of the date of this offering memorandum, made for a fair
value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the
purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential
property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that,
as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the
investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

(iv) transactions entered into, payments made or guarantees granted with respect to the debtor’s
goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano attestato di risanamento
(see “Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to
_Articles 56 or 284 of the Italian Insolvency Code” above);_

(v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security interests granted in the

390


-----

context of a court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), of a
restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad
_omologazione) provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code or of_
sanctioned debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei
_debiti omologati) and/or transactions entered into, payments made and security interests_
legitimately granted by the debtor after the filing of the application for a _concordato_
_preventivo or of an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti (see above);_

(vi) remuneration payments to the entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried
out by them; and

(vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect
to services necessary for access to a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring framework (see
below under “pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione
_della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società)”) or to other insolvency procedures provided for_
pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to Article 170 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the limitation period for initiating clawback action proceedings is three years from the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or, if
earlier, five years from the act or transaction to be clawed back. In case judicial liquidation is
commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according
to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated
backward from the date in which such petition is filed. In addition, in certain cases, the judicial
receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor be declared ineffective within the
ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian
Civil Code. In this respect, under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand
that transactions whereby the entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be
declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the debtor was aware of such
prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated,
that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor for the purpose of prejudicing the
creditors) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person,
the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to
the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design).
The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

The Italian Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intragroup transactions. Under Article 290 of the Italian Insolvency Code the limitation period of
initiating intra-group claw-back actions (referring to acts and transactions entered into by
companies belonging to the same group that jeopardize the creditors’ interest) is extended to five
years from the filing for judicial winding-up declaration.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a
“simplified” claw-back action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in
place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors.
In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without
previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent)
transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g.,
gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called _fondo_
_patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be_
carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser. Finally, as noted above, the
Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of
private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

- **Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures.** One of the
main novelties included in the Italian Insolvency Code concerns the definition of the
organizational, administrative and accounting structures of a company which are deemed to be
adequate under Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, required by the applicable regulations for
the purpose of timely detection of the state of crisis and the undertaking of suitable initiatives by
the debtor. Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code requires the entrepreneur to adopt an
appropriate organizational structure in accordance with Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, for
the purpose of timely detection of the crisis of the company as well as the timely undertaking of
suitable initiatives to overcome the crisis and recover business continuity. However, neither the
aforementioned Article 3, in its current wording, nor Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, as

391


-----

amended by the Italian Insolvency Code, contains a precise description of the parameters,
conditions and characteristics that are deemed to be necessary/needed for the definition and
especially for the identification of “adequate structures”.

In this regard, Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code precisely enunciates, on the one hand, the
purposes to which the measures and structures must aim in order to be considered as adequate for
the timely detection of the crisis and, on the other hand, the relevant warning signs in relation to
the same. In this respect, it is stipulated that, for the purpose of the timely detection of the
company’s state of crisis, the measures and structures deemed to be adequate should make it
possible to:

(i) detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific
characteristics of the company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor;

(ii) verify the non-sustainability of debts and the absence of prospects for business continuity
for the next twelve months as well as the warning signs identified by Article 3, paragraph 4
of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iii) derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical
test for the reasonable pursuit of the debtor’s financial recovery.

For the sake of completeness and as set out above, it should also be noted that Article 3, paragraph
4 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides an exact indication of the warning signs, identified, inter
_alia, as follows:_

(i) the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 days equal to more than half of the
total monthly payroll amount;

(ii) the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an amount
greater than the amount of receivables that are not past due;

(iii) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past
due for more than 60 days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any
form for at least 60 days provided that they represent in the aggregate at least 5% of the
total exposures; and

(iv) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under Article 25_novies of the Italian Insolvency Code._

_Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese_
_in stato di insolvenza)_

The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and
commercial enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible,
companies must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200
employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least
two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and
services during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor,
a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for judicial winding-up proceedings with respect to
existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential
payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business
activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an
administrative phase.

**_Judicial Phase._** In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission
criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers
(commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or
reorganization. The judicial receiver submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from
the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit
the company to the procedure or place it into judicial winding-up.

**_Administrative Phase._** If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the
administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a
restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year
(unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic

392


-----

and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also
include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days
from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a
report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the
Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however,
should either plan fail, the company will be declared insolvent.

_Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (Ristrutturazione Industriale di Grandi Imprese in Stato_
_di Insolvenza)_

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian
Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is
complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The
Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company
must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative
phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have
at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including
those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry
following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry
assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will
manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit
a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be
completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan
is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company insolvent and open judicial winding-up
proceedings.

_Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), provided for pursuant to
Article 293 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code, is only available for public interest entities such as statecontrolled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can
be wound up pursuant to judicial liquidation proceedings, save for a different indication under Italian law. It is
irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative
winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the court but by the relevant
administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered
not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant
legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or
serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario
_liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company by the relevant governmental authority (e.g., the Bank of Italy_
or the Ministry of Economic Development, which are competent for the filing of an application for a declaration
of insolvency with the subsequent opening of the compulsory administrative winding-up proceeding). The
liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the
designated judge and the court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative
authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same
as under insolvency proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set
forth for insolvency proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a
compulsory administrative winding-up.

_Common rules for pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e_
_dell’insolvenza della società_

In order to facilitate access and filing of restructuring procedures by the Italian companies, Articles 120_bis and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code have been enacted, introducing a set of rules applicable to all pre-judicial_
liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza). Among other things,
pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code and the purposes of a successful

393


-----

restructuring, the plan may provide for “any modification of the articles of association of the debtor company,
_including capital increases and reductions, including with limitation or exclusion of the option right and other_
_modifications that directly affect the shareholders' participation rights, as well as for mergers, demergers and_
_transformations”. Shareholders, who may no longer have an interest in the company, are prevented from hindering_
the restructuring or even one of its stages. For this reason, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the
Italian Insolvency Code, the shareholders, while retaining a right to information in relation to both the initiation
and the progress of the restructuring process, may not remove the directors without just cause, as is the case for
the statutory auditors of joint stock companies, also in light of the fact that under the provisions of the Italian
Insolvency Code it is not considered as being just cause for directors’ removal, the filing for access to the prejudicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) when the related
legal conditions and requirements are met. However, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 5, shareholders
representing at least 10% of the filing company’s corporate capital may make a competing proposal.

The plan may provide for the formation of one class of shareholders or several classes if there are
shareholders to whom different rights are granted by the by-laws, including as a result of the changes provided
for in the plan. The formation of classes is, however, mandatory if the plan provides for changes that directly
affect the shareholders’ participation rights and, in any case, for large companies and companies with widespread
capital. In this context, special conditions for approval of the arrangement are set out pursuant to Article 120_quater of the Italian Insolvency Code when and if the plan provides for shareholder attributions. Specific rules_
are then provided to ensure that creditors’ interests are protected in all cases in which the restructuring tool
envisages shareholders to retain a participation in the company with a certain value.

Article 120-quinquies of the Italian Insolvency Code, regulates the execution phase of such measure. In
order to avoid any obstructive attitude of the shareholders towards the approval of the restructuring tool, this
provision expressly excludes the necessity for their approval and/or resolution on the implementation of such
restructuring tool, by generally attributing the relevant powers to the directors or more specifically to the
competent court, in relation to any amendment to the debtor’s by-laws which - being specifically provided for by
the plan - do not require any discretionary resolution. Finally, it is stipulated that changes in the corporate structure
resulting from the implementation of a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della
_crisi e dell’insolvenza) shall not be considered as and constitute cause for the termination or amendment of any_
agreement entered into by the debtor with third parties.

Articles 284 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code contain specific rules regarding (i) the access of a
group to one of the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e
_dell’insolvenza) aiming at unifying – to the extent possible – the relevant proceedings; (ii) liability lawsuits_
available to the receiver; and (iii) subordination of claims.

_Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_

In a judicial winding-up proceeding, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period of up
to two years (six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can
request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary clawback period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into
insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral
and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or
claw-back (revocatoria) provided for pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the noninsolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified
suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within the suspect period of one
year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the
judicial liquidation, at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds
by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment
(e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the
security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that
it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted
during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after
the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the
non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was
entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken

394


-----

simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening
of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation, if the
judicial receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. In case judicial liquidation
is commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170,
paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from the date in which such
petition is filed. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a
Guarantor’s Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a guarantor and/or
security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection
with security interests under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts
received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided,
holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts
under the related Security Documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited
exceptions, all transactions carried out by the debtor for no consideration are ineffective _vis-a-vis_ creditors if
entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial windingup procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject
to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the
liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the
insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a
court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and
(ii) under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of
the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after
the filing of the application followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up proceedings insolvency
declaration or in the prior two-year period; and B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany
loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or after the filing of the application followed by
the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors.

In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the
various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European
Union.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the registered office of any
member of the Group (such as the French Guarantor) or its main center of interests within the meaning of Article
R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code is deemed to be in France, it could be subject to French court-assisted
proceedings affecting creditors, i.e., mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings (which do not fall within the scope
of the Insolvency Regulation). In addition, to the extent that (i) its COMI is deemed to be in France or it has an
establishment in France or, (ii) in cases where the Insolvency Regulation does not apply, its registered office or
its main center of interests within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code, is deemed to
be in France, it could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e., either
safeguard proceedings and accelerated safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde and sauvegarde accélérée), judicial
reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization and
judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the Insolvency Regulation. Any
company of our Group having its COMI in France could be subject to French main insolvency proceedings within
the meaning of the Insolvency Regulation and any company of our Group having an establishment in France and
its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency
proceedings within the meaning of the Insolvency Regulation.

Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation also lists accelerated financial safeguard proceedings as
insolvency proceedings but accelerated financial safeguard proceedings no longer have a separate existence under
French law as they have been merged into accelerated safeguard proceedings as of October 1, 2021 (save for
proceedings commenced before this date) by Ordinance No 2021-1193 of September 15, 2021 (the “2021
**Ordinance”) and Decree No 2021-1218 of September 23, 2021 (the “2021 Decree”).**

395


-----

Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or court-administered proceedings with respect to debtors that
meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) €20 million in net
turnover and 250 employees or (y) €40 million in net turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect
to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in
cases where the Insolvency Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within
the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences preventive or insolvency proceedings with respect to the
member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts
having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to
specific control thresholds). Accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group
and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator (administrateur judiciaire) and creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes or
the Note Guarantees granted by the French Guarantor and corresponding security interests.

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to Article
1343-5 of the French Civil Code.

Pursuant to the provisions of this Article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings
involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial
position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment
dates of payment obligations that are due and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred
or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate,
as published semi-annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment
of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending
enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due
during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge.

If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the
course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “—Court-Assisted Proceedings”).

**_Insolvency Test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is
unable to pay its due debts (passif exigible) with its immediately available assets (actif disponible) taking into
account available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court
decision commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an
earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court decision. Except for fraud,
the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an
agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning
of the hardening period (see “—Hardening Period”).

**_Court-Assisted Proceedings_**

A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of court-assisted
proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main
creditors and stakeholders e.g., an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness.

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice,_
_mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see_
“—Insolvency Test”). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the order
of the President of the court appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried
out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor
itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of
the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the President of the competent court that appoints him or her, usually to

396


-----

facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a
purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement
nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and
creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have
accepted to take part in the proceedings usually also accept to abstain from such action while they are ongoing.
In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of
the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods”). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court
but is not formally approved by it.

_Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable_
difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test”) or has not been
insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the
court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis
of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the
supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a
maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the court may extend the conciliation period up to the
absolute maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved
(homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even
though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the
decision of the president of the court or the court itself.

The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its
creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its
indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors/stakeholders will be negotiated on a purely
consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor
forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are
not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take
part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency
proceedings (judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings) against the debtor for the duration of the
conciliation proceedings.

Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains
the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the
French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods”) if a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, is suing for
payment, or does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to stay
payment of its claim. In the latter case, the judge may, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, order the
postponement or the rescheduling of the creditor’s claims that have not yet fallen due. A joint-debtor and a third
party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s
obligations may benefit from grace periods so granted by the judge.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the
president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them
(in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any actions by the creditors party thereto against
the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further
recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the
request of the debtor - following a hearing held for that purpose to which the employee representatives or
representatives appointed by the social and economic committee (previously known as works council), as the case
may be, must be convened – if:

(i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the
debtor’s insolvency;

(ii) the terms of the conciliation agreement ensure the continuation of the business as a goingconcern; and

(iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors.

Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgment (constatation) as described above and,
in addition:

397


-----

(i) the decision of approval by the relevant civil or commercial court, which should only disclose
the amount of any Conciliation Lien (as defined below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure
the enforcement of the conciliation agreement, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain
confidential except vis-à-vis the social and economic committee or employee representatives that are informed of
the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s
office (greffe) of the court;

(ii) persons that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or
services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new
equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and postcommencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including with respect to certain pre-commencement or postcommencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “Conciliation Lien”), in the event of subsequent
safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

(iii) in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard or judicial reorganization
proceedings, the claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be
rescheduled or written off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before
the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted), not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in
the event that classes of affected parties are formed);

(iv) when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated
to its statutory auditors; and

(v) in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the date of occurrence of the insolvency (see “—Insolvency Test”), and therefore the starting date of
the hardening period (see “—Hardening Period”), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of
the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the
debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de
_l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:_

(i) interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded;

(ii) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the debtor retains the
right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings to impose grace periods on creditors who
were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations)
and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in
the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliator if he/she has been appointed to
monitor the implementation of the agreement and, taking into account the conditions of its performance; and

(iii) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code, a joint-debtor and a
third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s
obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted
to the debtor in the context of conciliation proceedings pursuant to article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial
Code or during the execution of the conciliation agreement pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French
Commercial Code mentioned above.

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president
of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination.
Termination will however not extend to the provisions of the conciliation agreement addressing the consequences
of such termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings
may also be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual
proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement
are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will
automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims
(decreased by potential recoveries made) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on
the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of
the debtor’s business, in particular through a “plan for the sale of the business” a.k.a. a prepack sale plan (plan de

398


-----

_cession) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial_
liquidation proceedings. Provided they comply with certain requirements, offers received in this context by the
mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may, after consultation of the public prosecutor, be considered by the court
in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an
ongoing contract by reducing the debtor’s rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation
of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end
or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the
commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers
retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement
being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any
specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of
insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before 3 months have elapsed as
from the end of the previous ones.

Conciliation proceedings during which the debtor has drawn up a draft plan supported by a large majority
of creditors that is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard is a mandatory
preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings.

Although French accelerated safeguard proceedings are the transposition into French law of preventive
restructuring proceedings in the spirit of the EU Restructuring Directive, they are defined in the French
Commercial Code by reference to standard safeguard proceedings.

As a result and for the sake of clarity, standard safeguard proceedings will be presented below before
accelerated safeguard proceedings.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see “—
_Insolvency test”). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at_
which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested even if they have a limited right to challenge the
court decision commencing the proceedings. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a courtappointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court
considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation
period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on
the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 12 months.
The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet
_de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate to its creditors (or submit to the classes of affected parties – see below)_
that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or equity holders do not have effective control over the
proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted or supervised by the court-appointed administrator.
The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her,
exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to
make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. A
supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed
at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator. Management decisions in respect
of disposals (acte de disposition) that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions
considered to be important under statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security
interests or settling disputes).

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation
_des paiements)_ before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’
representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the
safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, pursuant to Article L. 622-10 of the French Commercial Code, the court may convert
safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if
the debtor is insolvent or, (b) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the debtor would

399


-----

shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time
during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases,
the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative
or the public prosecutor or on its own initiative except in the case of (i)(b) above where:

(i) the court may not act upon its own initiative, and

(ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controller
(“Contrôleurs”) (if any), the public prosecutor and the employees’ representatives (if any).

In case of the situation described in (i)(b) above, the court would decide the conversion (i) at the request
of the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor if no draft plan was
approved by the relevant classes of affected parties or (ii) at the sole request of the debtor in all other
circumstances.

In case of conversion of the proceedings, classes of affected parties that would already be constituted
before the conversion would remain with the same allocation and computation of the votes, subject to pending
challenges. The process of constitution of classes shall continue notwithstanding this conversion.

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor
becomes immediately due and payable.

_Judicial Restructuring Lien_

Persons that, in the context of accelerated safeguard, safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings, provide new money (except through a share capital increase) (the “Judicial Restructuring Lien”):

(i) during the observation period in safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings or the
temporary continuation of business operations in judicial liquidation proceedings, in order to ensure the continuity
of the debtor’s business during this period, in which case such financing must be authorized by the supervisory
judge and are subject to publicity, or

(ii) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (including a plan ordered by the
court that substantially modifies a previous one), in which case the amount and the privilege must be specifically
mentioned in the draft plan on which the affected parties are called upon to vote as well as in the court decision
adopting the plan,

enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims with the exception
of (i) employees’ super-privileged claims, (ii) procedural costs, (iii) the Conciliation Lien, (iv) precommencement claims secured by security interests over real estate assets (only in the context of judicial
liquidation proceedings) and (v) post-commencement wages claims not advanced through the French wages
guarantee scheme (AGS) under provisions of Articles L. 3253-8 to L. 3253-13 of the French Labor Code.

The Judicial Restructuring Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided prior to
commencement of the proceedings.

In addition, such claims may not be rescheduled or written-off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan
(although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) without the consent
of the relevant creditors, not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that classes of
affected parties are formed), in the on-going or in subsequent safeguard proceedings or judicial reorganization
proceedings.

Creditors (and if applicable, equity holders) must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s
liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps etc.)
prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of
the business.

_Standard Consultation_

Standard consultation applies in respect of debtors that, on the date of the petition for commencement of
the proceedings (on a stand-alone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning

of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) have less than (x) 250 employees and €20
million in net turnover or (y) €40 million in net turnover unless, upon their request, the supervisory judge
authorizes a class-based consultation of their creditors (see below).

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the creditors
representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and
payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and
whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal
commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is
justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the creditors representative. In practice, it
is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time
period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for
agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the
plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of
the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap proposals which require the agreement of each
individual creditor in writing) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps
a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the
controllers.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de
_sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were_
submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the ones applicable to claims benefiting from the
Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural
businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates falling after the term of the
plan, in which case the maturity dates shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity
swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment
adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5%
of the amount of each debt claim and, as from the sixth year, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at
least 10% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date
following the initial maturity of the claim if such date is later than the first payment date provided for in the plan,
in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been
paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that
the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving
access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple
majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least
half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to
quorum and majority shall apply.

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such
share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be
reduced according to the provisions of the plan). If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period
during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be
disposed of without the court’s consent. The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation.
However, when the modification is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of
liabilities, the interested parties are consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court
clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following the receipt.

Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate to debt writeoffs or debt-to-equity swaps.

_Class-based Consultation_

Class-based consultation applies to companies that, on the date of the petition for commencement of the
proceedings, meet or exceed either of the following thresholds (x) 250 employees and €20 million in net turnover

401


-----

or (y) €40 million in net turnover (on a standalone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control,
within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code), or upon the debtor’s
request and with the authorization of the supervisory judge if they do not meet such thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the
assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties (parties affectées),
as defined below.

Only the affected parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan.

Pursuant to Article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code, affected parties are:

(i) creditors whose rights are directly impaired by the proposed plan;

(ii) equity holders (including shareholders and holders of securities giving future rights to the share
capital) if their equity interests, the debtor’s articles of association or by-laws, or their rights are modified by the
proposed plan.

The court-appointed administrator is responsible for drawing up the classes and informing each affected
party that it is a member of a class. The court-appointed administrator must, on the basis of objective verifiable
criteria, allocate the affected parties in classes presenting a sufficient commonality of economic interest
(communauté d’intérêt économique suffisante) in compliance with the following conditions:

(i) creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles), in respect of
their claims so secured, and other creditors shall belong to different classes;

(ii) the class formation shall comply with subordination agreements entered into before
commencement of the proceedings that shall have been brought to the attention of the court-appointed
administrator within ten days from his notification to each affected party of its membership in a class;

(iii) equity holders shall make up one or more classes; and

(iv) claims arising from employment contracts (including the French wage guarantee scheme (AGS)
claims), pension rights, and maintenance claims cannot be affected by the plan and in respect of creditors secured
by a security trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor, only the amount of their claims that are not secured by such
security trust is taken into account.

The court-appointed administrator shall notify to each affected party the criteria for class formation and
for the determination of the voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights allowing them to cast a
vote. The amount of the claims taken into consideration is the one communicated by the debtor and certified by
its auditor(s) or, failing that, endorsed by a certificate from its chartered accountant. Future interest claims
calculated by a reference to an index are calculated by reference to the value of the index at the date of the court
decision commencing the proceedings. The claims of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) shall only be
taken into account for the portion of their claim not secured by the security trust.

Any affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors representative or the court-appointed
administrator is entitled, within ten days following the notification of the criteria for the formation of the classes
and the determination of the voting rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, to dispute the same before the
supervisory judge. The supervisory judge must rule within ten days of the referral date, and failing that, any
aforementioned person may refer the dispute to the court, which must rule within ten days of such later referral
date. The supervisory judge’s decision (or the court’s decision, as the case may be) may be appealed by the parties
within five days of its notification to the parties and by the public prosecutor within five days of its communication
thereto.

The proposed plan may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debt-for-equity
swaps (subject to specific exceptions, including in respect of claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the
Judicial Restructuring Lien). The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary
according to the parties concerned (creditors, bondholders, equity holders) and are ultimately determined by the
court-appointed judicial administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree.

402


-----

The classes must approve or reject the plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be
extended or shortened by the supervisory judge, upon prior request of the debtor or the court-appointed
administrator, but may not be shorter than 15 days.

The decision shall be taken by each class by a two-thirds majority of the votes held by the members
casting a vote.

If applicable, the class or classes of equity holders vote under the rules governing votes at
shareholders/equity holders’ general meetings, except that the decision is taken at the same two-thirds majority.

Once the draft plan has been adopted by each of the classes, it will be submitted to the commercial court
which shall essentially verify that the following conditions are met:

(i) the classes have been duly formed in accordance with the rules mentioned above;

(ii) affected parties, sharing a sufficient commonality of interest within the same class, are treated
equally and in proportion to their claim or right;

(iii) the plan has been duly notified to all the affected parties;

(iv) if there are dissenting affected parties, the plan meets the “best interests of creditors” test (i.e.,
no dissenting party is worse off as a result of the plan than it would be if the order of priority of payments in a
judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de
_cession)) or in the event of a better alternative solution if the plan was not approved);_

(v) where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not
excessively impair the interests of the affected parties; and

(vi) the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected.

The court may refuse to adopt the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the debtor’s
insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The judgment adopting the plan renders the plan
enforceable against all (erga omnes) (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted against the adoption
of the plan). As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase,
the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their
admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan).

_Cross-class Cram-down_

The 2021 Ordinance has introduced a cross-class cram-down mechanism into French law: where the
safeguard plan is not approved by a two-thirds majority of each class, it may be adopted by the court at the request
of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator (with the approval of the debtor) and be imposed on the parties
that voted against the plan provided that:

(i) the plan complies with the conditions for adoption of the plan by the court mentioned
above;

(ii) the plan has been approved by:

(A) a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, provided that at
least one such class is a class of creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem
(sûretés réelles) or is senior to the unsecured creditors class (créanciers chirographaires); or,
if such condition is not met,

(B) at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than an
equity holders’ class or any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a
going concern, could reasonably be expected not to be entitled to any payment if the order of
priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal
sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession));

403


-----

(iii) the claims held by a dissenting class of affected parties are fully paid (by identical or
equivalent means) if a lower ranking class is entitled to be paid or retains an interest within the plan (i.e.,
absolute priority rule);

(iv) no class of affected parties receives or retains, under the plan, more than the total
amount of its claims or interests;

(v) where one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not
approved the plan, the plan can be imposed on such dissenting equity holders if:

(A) the debtor (on a standalone basis or together with other entities which they
hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial
Code) meets or exceeds either of the following thresholds: (x) 250 employees and €20 million
of net turnover or (y) €40 million in net turnover;

(B) it is reasonably foreseeable, after determining the value of the debtor as a
going concern, that the equity holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to
any payment or retain any interest if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation
were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de
cession));

(C) if the plan provides for a capital increase to be paid up by cash contribution
or by way of set off of claims, the shares issued are offered by preference to the shareholders,
pro rata their shareholding; and

(D) the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of the
dissenting class or classes of equity holders.

The court’s decision constitutes approval of the changes to the shareholding structure, to the rights of the
equity holders, to the articles of association or the by-laws provided for in the plan. The court may appoint a
judicial representative to perform the acts necessary for the implementation of these changes.

Upon request from the debtor, or from the court-appointed administrator with the debtor’s consent, the
court can override the absolute priority rule if it is deemed necessary to achieve the plan’s objectives and if the
plan does not excessively affect the rights or interests of affected parties. In particular, supplier claims, equity
holders and tort liability claims may benefit from such exemption.

As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a
time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor
may not be disposed of without court’s consent.

If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the classes of affected parties, the court may, at the request
of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, convert the
safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan
is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead the debtor to shortly becoming
insolvent.

At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having
voted against the draft plan and considering that:

(i) the best interest test criterion has not been met; or

(ii) in the event of a plan adopted by a cross-class cram-down and, based on the valuation
of the debtor as a going concern, either (or both) of the following conditions has not been met:

(A) in the event that the plan was approved solely by the vote of an affected class
that was not an equity holder class, such class would not have been entitled to a payment if the
order of payment in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale
or, a court-ordered sale plan);

(B) in the event that a class, or classes, of equity holders voted against the plan,
it would be reasonable to assume that such class(es) would not have received a payment or

404


-----

retained an interest in the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation
were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or of a court-ordered sale plan) may
petition the court to dispute the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the public
prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the same decision, determine the value of the debtor (it
being noted that the court is in charge of determining the said value, for the purposes of which
it is entitled to order the appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the
aforementioned conditions and on the adoption of the plan.

This decision may itself be challenged within ten days of its notification or communication to them, by
the affected party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors representative or the public prosecutor.

In the event no safeguard plan is adopted through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by
approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down), there is no statute that allows French
courts to impose a term-out (i.e., a rescheduling over a maximum period of 10 years of the indebtedness of
dissenting creditors) although the courts retain this power under statute if the plan is adopted under the standard
consultation procedure (i.e., if no classes are formed) in safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings and, in
judicial reorganization proceedings only, in case of failure of the class-based consultation (see “—Court_Administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”)._

Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social
security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are
similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in
a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages,
or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a
local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant
relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments,
penalties or fines.

Where the plan provides for debt write-offs or rescheduling affecting secured public creditors’ claims,
the administrator can decide to gather those public creditors within a class (or classes) of affected parties called
upon to vote on the proposed plan.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard_**

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) enabling it to implement a restructuring plan in an
expedited fashion through a class-based consultation.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

(i) its financial statements must have been certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire
_aux comptes) or drawn-up by a chartered accountant (expert-comptable);_

(ii) the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the
commencement of the proceedings;

(iii) as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that
it is not in a position to overcome;

(iv) the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its
business as a going concern that is likely to be supported by enough of the parties that will be impaired
to render its adoption plausible within an initial two-month period, that may be extended up to a total
maximum of four months, following commencement of the accelerated safeguard proceedings, upon
request from the debtor and the court-appointed administrator; and

(v) the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied
for commencement of conciliation proceedings.

The debtor may request the limitation of the scope of the accelerated safeguard proceedings to its
financial creditors only, if the nature of its indebtedness is such that a plan could be adopted by such creditors
alone.

405


-----

If the debtor does not meet the thresholds above that require creditor classes (see above) to be formed,
the court must order such formation in the decision commencing the proceedings.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard
proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and the provisions relating to the recovery
of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings.

The plan, in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings, is adopted following the same majority
rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and
conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the
court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the
class process and, in particular, cannot impose a term-out. The list of claims of affected parties, party to the
conciliation proceedings, established by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor or the chartered
accountant, shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard
proceedings unless the affected parties otherwise elect to make such a filing (see “—Status of Creditors during
_Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”)._

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire)
proceedings may be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of judicial liquidation
proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible.

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, within
45 days of becoming insolvent if it has not filed for conciliation proceedings in the meantime (as discussed above).
De jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file
such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court,
after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may
order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if
the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial
reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period,
upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire), a controller, the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial_
reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is
manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the person(s) appointed by
the social and economic committee (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the
preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or
judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes
immediately due and payable.

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually
appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up
to 18 months (instead of a maximum of 12 months under safeguard proceedings), and make proposals either for
the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is
similar to a draft safeguard plan and may include a partial sale of the business), the partial or total sale of the
business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making
management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management
and control of the debtor (mission d’administration).

Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard
proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities.

Differences exist under judicial reorganization proceedings in respect of class formation and the adoption
of the restructuring plan. The main differences are as follows:

406


-----

(i) if the debtor does not meet the required threshold(s) the authorization to form classes
of affected parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the court-appointed administrator
on their own, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor);

(ii) any affected party may submit a draft plan to the vote of the classes. The draft plan
shall be submitted, together with the plan proposed by the debtor, at the latest 15 days before the date of
the vote;

(iii) if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure
or share transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void;

(iv) if the plan has not been approved by all classes of affected parties, a cross-class cramdown may be requested by the court-appointed administrator with the agreement of the debtor or, unlike
safeguard proceedings, of an affected party (meaning that the cross-class cram-down mechanism can be
used without the debtor’s consent); and

(v) in the event that plan approval through the class-based consultation procedure (whether
by regular approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down) fails the approval
of the plan may occur through the standard consultation rules (see above).

In relation to equity holders, the following is also to be noted in the event of judicial reorganization
proceedings:

(i) in case a shareholders meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders equity to a level
equal to at least one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial
Code, the court-appointed administrator may request the appointment a court officer (mandataire de
_justice) to convene a shareholders meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to_
the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to
vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity
to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan;

(ii) if (a) the debtor company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the
meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (b)
the disappearance of the debtor company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional
economy and to local employment, (c) the modification of the debtor company’s share capital appears
to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued
operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or
of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and
(y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided
that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the debtor company’s share capital
required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court
may either:

(A) appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders
meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so,
up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or

(B) order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the
reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having
refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share
capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement
with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the debtor company’s shareholders meetings,
any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw
from the debtor company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the
transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing
agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary
proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new
shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the
reorganization plan.

407


-----

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly unlikely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if
no reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial
sale of the business as part of a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession).

At any time during the observation period, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the controllers (if any), the public prosecutor
or at its own initiative, order a partial cessation of activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation
of the debtor if its reorganization is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of
the proceedings is decided by the court.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator,
which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in
judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial
liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the
liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the
liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors priority order of payment). The liquidator will
take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its
management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes, both of which
are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors:

(i) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed
administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed, or remain in office if already
appointed, to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations
ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a goingconcern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession), any third party (as construed under French
insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business.

As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets
(including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save
exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is usually at a
significant discount compared to their in bonis market value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale
plan that ensures the continuation of the business as a going-concern and the preservation of jobs, over
the payment of creditors.

Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors,
including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price
operating the release of their security interests. By way of exception:

(A) a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to
creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such
creditors and included in the sale of the business plan (to the extent the latter have duly filed
their claims; see “—Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial
_Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”);_

(B) the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial
lease only if the outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the
value of the leased asset as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by
the court); and

(C) only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the
case for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over
real estate assets) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they
have such right (and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until they are repaid in full of their
claim so secured or unless an agreement is reached with the relevant parties.

Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business
of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in
different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred
assets could be significantly less than their in bonis market value; or

408


-----

(ii) separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may
decide to:

(A) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères or _adjudication amiable for real_
estate assets only);

(B) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which
spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the supervisory
judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or

(C) request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential
interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive
process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices
being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to
implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has
varied.

If the court orders a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential
to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the judicial liquidation proceedings when either:

(i) no due liabilities remain or the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors
(extinction du passif); or

(ii) continuation of the liquidation operations becomes impossible due to insufficiency of
assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

(i) when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate
compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or

(ii) in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors in full, by
appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received
from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

_The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings_

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court decision
commencing the proceedings, unless, in this decision or in a subsequent one, the court sets an earlier date, which
may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings. Also, except
in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision
that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency
date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from
the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the
court.

Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening
period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other
creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under
which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of
debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used
in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has
not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French
Civil Code, any contractual security or contractual retention right granted for debts previously incurred (unless
they replace a previous security interest of at least an equivalent nature and base and with the exception of the
assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) made in execution of a framework agreement entered
into prior to the date of insolvency), any statutory mortgage attached to judgments of condemnation constituted

409


-----

on the debtor’s assets for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures
_conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock_
options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security
for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights
already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations
of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French
Commercial Code.

Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for
consideration, administrative seizure measures, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers
_détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court_
determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew (or could not ignore) that the debtor was insolvent at the
relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of
exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French
Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the
hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the
court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable”.
There is no hardening period prior to safeguard proceedings or to accelerated safeguard proceedings (assuming
the latter proceedings are successful).

_Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation_
_Proceedings_

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration
of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued
operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against
the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract,
diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization
proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, no. 12-22.909,
which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, except in
accelerated safeguard proceedings the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing
contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the
court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations
even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its postcommencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The
commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a
debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of
a sale plan (plan de cession) as described above. In such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur
on the date of the court decision ordering the sale plan, as described above, or on the date on which the continued
operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

(i) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one
year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued
interest can no longer be compounded);

(ii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes)
debts and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets (whether
they are pledged, retained by a creditor based on a retention right or constitute collateral in a security
trust estate (patrimoine fiduciaire) required by the continued operation of the business) or to pay a carrier
requesting payment directly from the debtor);

(iii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of
the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation
period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; security interests can be
granted as regards such debts the payment of which is not prohibited, subject to prior authorization by
the supervisory judge;

410


-----

(iv) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred
for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services
rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if
not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain
limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a Conciliation Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien),
provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the
mandataire judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the
judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period;

(v) creditors (or beneficiaries of a third party security granted by the debtor) may not
initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor or a
person having granted a security over its own assets to secure the debtor’s debt, where such guarantor is
a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or judicial reorganization
proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings,
if the objective of such legal action is:

(A) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor
(however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof
of claim, as described below);

(B) to terminate a contract for nonpayment of amounts owed to the creditor; or

(C) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if
such assets secure third party debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the
applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets
or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable is located in
another Member State within the European Union at the time of the opening of the proceedings,
in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency
proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the Insolvency
Regulation (subject to secondary proceedings that may be commenced in such Member State).
Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would
only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if such proceedings were to be
recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise
in a treaty to which France is a party);

(vi) any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention
right: (by any means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration
of securities or proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is
prohibited; any contrary provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of the
debtor not yet in existence on the date of the decision commencing the proceedings, will be held
unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the increase in the
base of a contractual security interest may however validly result from an assignment of professional
receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a framework agreement entered into before commencement
of the proceedings or from other specific contrary provisions of the French Commercial Code regarding
restructuring and insolvency, the French Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code;
and

(vii) in the context of reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings only, absent consent
to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract
(contrat en cours), will be required.

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor (or a person having granted a security over its own
assets to secure the debtor’s debt) may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan or of a judicial
reorganization plan adopted by the court.

In accelerated safeguard, the above rules would only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of
the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to creditors that are not within the scope of the proceedings continue to
be payable in the ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the
commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors representative within two

411


-----

months of the publication of the court decision in the relevant official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des Annonces
_Civiles et Commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan_
France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which
the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims
have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving
distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are
preferred creditors under French law.

In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third
party must also file a proof of claim with the creditors’ representative under the same conditions.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the
creditors representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the
creditors representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of
the claim with the creditors representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a
proof of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They
may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above.

In accelerated safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having
taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or chartered accountant.
Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of
this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared
by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation
proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors
included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court orders a sale plan (plan de cession)
of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale
will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides
to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the
debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including
employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a
Conciliation Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and
public creditors (i.e., taxes and social charges).

In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose
claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority is
not relevant to all creditors, for example creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their
claim related to such asset will be treated separately.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where
safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only
be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting of such facilities
was wrongful and if the relevant creditor (i) committed a fraud, or (ii) manifestly interfered with the management
of the debtor or (iii) obtained security or guarantees that are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any
security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these
grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of the French Guarantor are subject to:

(a) certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute
prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code
or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial
Code; and

(b) French corporate benefit rules.

412


-----

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of
another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of the acquisition or the subscription of its
own shares by a third party.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the
transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee
unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient
return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a
real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit
received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantor and the amounts recoverable thereunder
will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly
or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer to the French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or
similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor
under its Notes Guarantees. Any payment made by the French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantees in respect of
the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due
by the French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue
of this limitation, the French Guarantor’s obligation under the Notes Guarantees could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or the French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its
Notes Guarantees. Additionally, to the extent that the relevant intercompany loans are subsequently repaid or
cancelled, including pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement upon an enforcement, such Notes Guarantee granted
by the French Guarantor will be reduced or fall away.

No French Guarantor will be acting jointly and severally with the Issuer and/or the other Guarantors as
regards its obligations.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on
the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security
Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted
that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any
of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société
_par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte_
_de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly_
established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by
each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the
relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of the
French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly registered
(such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security
interest if it is not publicly registered.

**_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (soulte)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is
due and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the
form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the
secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale
being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual
foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured
creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of
foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed
extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context
of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the
value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor
a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount
of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured
creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

413


-----

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to
the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance
with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale
price received in any such auction might not be sufficient to satisfy the claims of the secured creditors and might
not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or
a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined
pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

**_Security Agent_**

Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security interests and personal
guarantees for the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately from its own estate. As
a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if the
security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a
right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or willful
misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal actions to protect the secured
creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency proceeding.
The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying its quality, its duties, the duration
of its duties and its powers.

**_Parallel Debt—Trust_**

The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security
Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, there will be
provided for the creation of ”parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”)
mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes
under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”).

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal
Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt
and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant
to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor
under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly
secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the
Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the
Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed
by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing
of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French
Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not
contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis
that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt
mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition
by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure
will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is
limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests
securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case
analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the
rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt
construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as
Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders
of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests
in the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy
of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

414


-----

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important
following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the
holders of the Notes.

The concept of "trust" has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011_
n°10-25533 Belvedere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New
York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985
on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of "trust" has not been generally
recognized under French law.

**_Fraudulent conveyance_**

French law contains specific, “action paulienne” provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in
and outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their
means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to
which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides
security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security or any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged (i) in the context of the insolvency
proceedings of the relevant debtor, by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the court-appointed
safeguard or reorganization plan commissioner (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), or (ii) by any of the creditors
of the relevant debtor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside
insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against all the creditors of the relevant
debtor or the concerned creditor who lodged the claim (see below) if:

(a) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so;

(b) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor
was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and

(c) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the
transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future)
would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration
(à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary).

If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Collateral, or the
granting of a Notes Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under
applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting
of such Notes Guarantee could be (i) declared unenforceable against all the creditors of the debtor if the claim
was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the court-appointed safeguard or
reorganization plan commissioner (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) or (ii) declared unenforceable against the
creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of
the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Notes Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral
and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security
interests in the Collateral or the Notes Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes
and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be
held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the
fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor
Agreement, except for Articles L. 626-30 and L. 628-7 of the French Commercial Code pursuant to which, in the
context of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the court-appointed administrator, while constituting
the classes shall comply with the provisions of subordination agreements between creditors that were entered into
prior to the commencement of the safeguard, accelerated safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings,
provided that such subordination agreements have been brought to his attention within the required deadline.

415


-----

As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this offering
memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect
to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

One of the Guarantors is organized under the laws of Germany (the “German Guarantor”) and is likely
to have its “center of main interest” in Germany. In the event of insolvency of the Guarantor, or any of the Issuer’s
relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany subject to the information
presented under subsection “European Union”, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated
in Germany. If so, German law would then govern most, if not all, aspects of those proceedings.

In contrast, pursuant to the Insolvency Regulation, where a German company conducts business in more
than one member state of the EU and the company’s “center of main interests” at the time insolvency proceedings
are initiated is found to be in a member state other than Germany (see “—European Union”), main insolvency
proceedings would most likely be initiated in that other member state. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in
particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) or the Corporate Stabilization and
Restructuring Act (StaRUG), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other
jurisdictions and, for example, may restrict creditors’ interests, including in respect of priority of creditors and the
ability to obtain post-petition interest for unsecured claims, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments
due on the Notes. See “Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or the Collateral
_across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult.”_

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency

court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Insolvency proceedings under German law with respect to a debtor incorporated as a German limited liability
company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or any other corporation or partnership not having an individual
as a personally liable shareholder, can be initiated by either the debtor or a creditor in the event of
over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor. A debtor is considered
illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due. As a guideline, a company is considered illiquid
if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks. A debtor is
considered over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets unless a continuation of the business is
predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on a 12 month forecast horizon (positive
_Fortführungsprognose), which is temporarily shortened pursuant to the SanInsKG (as defined below) to a four_
month forecast horizon applicable during the period from November 9, 2022 to December 31, 2023. Whether the
debtor’s liabilities exceed the value of its assets must be assessed on the basis of an over-indebtedness balance
sheet to be drawn up on the basis of the liquidation values. If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit
_beschränkter Haftung—GmbH), a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation_
based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE), any other limited liability company or any company not having an
individual as personally liable shareholder finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the
management board or managing director or, under certain circumstances, the shareholder of such company is
obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay (ohne schuldhaftes Zögern) but not later than three weeks
after such illiquidity was established and/or six weeks after the establishment of over-indebtedness (pursuant to
the SanInsKG (as defined below) this period is temporarily extended to eight weeks applicable during the period
from November 9, 2022 to December 31, 2023) as the case may be. In addition, only the debtor can file for
insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if it will most likely be
unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due during the course of a forecast period of (typically) the next 24
months, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file
for insolvency proceedings.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due

performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary protective measures to secure the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) during the preliminary
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken
to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets other than immovable assets during these preliminary
proceedings and will, in almost all cases (ordinary proceedings), appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator
(vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The duty of the preliminary administrator is, in particular, to safeguard and to

416


-----

preserve the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse), to verify the existence of a reason for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsgrund) and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover
the costs of the insolvency proceedings.

Exceptionally, if a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted but is not yet illiquid and
unless – from a third party perspective - there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring, it may specify
in its insolvency petition that it is seeking to enter into one out of two possible types of preliminary debtor-inpossession protection schemes, including a scheme that is commonly referred to as protective shield proceedings
(Schutzschirmverfahren). Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger
_Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets). The court may_
also resolve other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three
months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be implemented in
debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after main insolvency proceedings have been opened.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger
_Gläubigerausschuss) will (absent certain exemptions) be set up if the debtor satisfies two of the following three_
requirements: (i) a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is
over-indebted), (ii) revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the 12 months prior to the last balance sheet date and/or
(iii) an annual average of 50 or more employees. The requirements apply to the respective entity without taking
into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate
in certain important insolvency court decisions. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following:
(i) the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator or an insolvency administrator (vorläufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter_ _und_ _Insolvenzverwalter),_ (ii) orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der
_Eigenverwaltung),_ and (iii) appointments of a preliminary trustee or a trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter or
_Sachwalter)._

The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of insolvency proceedings if certain requirements

are met, in particular if (i) the debtor is in a situation of illiquidity or impending illiquidity and/or over- indebted
and (ii) there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor
are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties,
for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening
of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse)
following which the company will, inter alia, be deemed dissolved and put into liquidation.

Upon the opening of main insolvency proceedings, the right to manage and dispose over the business

and assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who is appointed by the
insolvency court unless debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered, in which event the court
will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. The
creditors are only entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator by the court at the
occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a
simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed
individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual is eligible as an officeholder, i.e.,
sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial.

The insolvency administrator has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets,
whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency administrator (or in case of
debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur
other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the
insolvency estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any liabilities created by the debtor (or a
preliminary insolvency administrator/trustee prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (including
secured debt, subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) and other security interests)). The insolvency
administrator or trustee may, on the grounds of avoidance (Insolvenzanfechtung), also challenge transactions that
are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings.

For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of an opening of German insolvency proceedings against
the German Guarantor would include, among others, the following:

a) unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to
administer and dispose of the German Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the

417


-----

(preliminary) court-appointed insolvency administrator ((vorläufiger) _Insolvenzverwalter)_ as
sole representative of the insolvency estate;

b) unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected
by the German Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are null
and void by operation of law;

c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in
the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in
part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such
security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency
proceedings;

d) claims against the German Guarantor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the
rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) with regard to an asset, i.e., where the
relevant asset does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the
insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary
court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

Certain of these consequences may already impact the position of the holders of the notes prior to the

opening of insolvency proceedings if so ordered by the competent insolvency court following the insolvency
petition during preliminary proceedings.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert
claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are
collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can
instead only enforce them in compliance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). Any individual enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) already brought against the debtor
by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once formal insolvency proceedings have been opened (and
may be subject to such stay already prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Secured creditors are
generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency
proceedings, however, certain secured creditors have preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) regarding the
enforcement of their security interest. Depending on the legal nature of a security interest, German insolvency
law bestows entitlement to enforce such security either with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator.
The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession
which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights
(Mobiliarpfandrechte) or transfers of title by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well (ii) to collect any
claims that have been assigned by way of security (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested
in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the
value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which,
in aggregate, add up to nine percent of the gross enforcement proceeds, and less German value added tax
(Umsatzsteuer) at a rate of currently 19 percent thereon (if applicable), are paid to the creditor holding a security
interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The contributory charges will benefit
the general insolvency estate. In the case of debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the cost of
assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) cannot be deducted from the enforcement proceeds.
Different rules might apply with regard to any security interest that constitutes financial collateral.

The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate
(Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings). Typically, liabilities resulting from
acts of an insolvency administrator that have taken place after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings
constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. After the liabilities of the estate, all unpreferred and unsecured claims
(Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors unless they are subordinated as a matter of
statutory law, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis from the free (net) insolvency estate of the debtor
(Insolvenzmasse) that remains after assets have been disposed of and all prior-ranking liabilities have been settled
and paid. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan)
that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator to the creditors within formal insolvency
proceedings and which, in order to become effective, requires, among others and subject to certain exceptions,
the consent of a majority of creditor classes and, within each approving class, the majority of creditors belonging

418


-----

to such class (subject to specific majority rules and cram down rules). Under German insolvency laws, it is
possible to implement a debt-to-equity-swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force
a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if that creditor does not consent to such debt-to-equity-swap.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator,
however, may then be required to compensate the creditor for the loss in value of such movable asset.

If the German Guarantor grants security over its assets to other creditors than the holders of the Notes,
such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The proceeds resulting
from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the Notes under the Guarantees granted by the
German Guarantor after such secured creditors have been satisfied.

If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, it may also file for preliminary
debtor-in-possession proceedings. In such a case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit
enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets) and may implement other preliminary
measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for a period of up to three months if an
independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich
_aussichtslos). During such period, the debtor shall, together with its creditors and a preliminary trustee_
_(vorläufiger Sachwalter), prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be implemented in formal_
debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in
the relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in
the relevant debtor company. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such debtor, the claims
against such debtor would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen),
meaning that dividends on such claim would only be made if all non-subordinated creditors’ claims have been
fully satisfied. Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over
the assets of the debtor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing
these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed, which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed
by German law as, in most cases, the insolvency estate will not be sufficient to distribute any dividends on
subordinated insolvency claims.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite
the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency
proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant
entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings
(if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies
in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. Recently, the German
legislature adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz _zur Erleichterung der_
_Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which came into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides_
for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The act does not
provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation
of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group,
but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in order to
facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group
entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group
companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency
administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”
_(Koordinationsverfahren)_ and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator”

_(Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan)._

Powers of attorney granted by the debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon
the opening of insolvency proceedings. In addition, most executory contracts become unenforceable at such time
unless the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”

entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the
opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of
reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder
_Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not_

419


-----

to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate
to agreements that are not governed by German law.

**_Creditor’s Liability_**

Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the
grantor of the guarantee could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to
act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of
the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the
transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee is close to collapse
(Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of insolvency proceedings being opened in Germany with respect to the German Guarantor,
the Guarantee and the security interests provided by that entity could be subject to potential challenges by an
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) under the rules of avoidance (Anfechtung) as set out in the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Under these rules, an insolvency administrator (or in the event of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the
trustee (Sachwalter)), may challenge acts (Rechtshandlungen) and transactions (Rechtsgeschäfte) that are deemed
detrimental to the insolvency estate and have been effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings.
Such challengeable transactions can include payments under any guarantee or the granting of security interests
(including guarantees). In the event that a transaction is successfully challenged, the beneficiaries of such
guarantee or security interest (such as the holders of Notes) would be under an obligation to repay the amount
already received under the relevant security or guarantee, or to waive the guarantee.

In particular, an act or a transaction detrimental to the insolvency estate may be challenged according to
the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases:

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) or transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) granting a creditor, or enabling an
insolvency creditor to obtain, security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a debt can be
avoided if such act was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due and the creditor
had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been
filed and the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity or of the filing of such petition (or, in the
case of either (i) or (ii), the creditor had knowledge of circumstances imperatively suggesting such
illiquidity);

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) or transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) granting a creditor, or enabling an
insolvency creditor to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was not entitled or which
was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to
such security or satisfaction can be avoided if such act was effected in the month prior to the filing
of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time thereafter; if such act was
effected in the second and third month prior to the filing, it can be avoided if at the time of such act
(i) the debtor was illiquid or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the
creditors of the debtor (or had knowledge of circumstances imperatively suggesting such detrimental
effects);

    - any transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors
of the debtor, or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a
proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable if it was entered into, can be
avoided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the transaction the debtor
was illiquid and the other party to the transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the
transaction had knowledge of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the
transaction;

420


-----

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor, including the granting of guarantees and security
interests, during a period of ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or after such filing, if the debtor acted with the intention to prejudice its creditors, can
be avoided if the other party had knowledge of such intention at the time of such act, with such
knowledge being presumed if the other party knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and
that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. In the case that the relevant act granted a
creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the avoidability of acts is
limited to four years. In the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to
obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor was entitled in that form and that
time, knowledge of such creditor of the intention of the debtor to prejudice its insolvency creditors
shall (only) be presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was illiquid and that the relevant act
disadvantaged the other creditors. The fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor
or agreed to deferred payments shall establish the presumption that he had no knowledge of the
debtor being illiquid at this time;

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without adequate consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor
grants security for a third-party debt) might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously
(unentgeltlich); a gratuitous transaction can be avoided if it was effected in the four years prior to
the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor;

    - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which
directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract (i) was
concluded within two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or (ii) the
other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of
corporate entities, the term “related party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the
management or supervisory/advisory board, shareholders owning more than 25 percent of the
debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to
information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives
or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

    - any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction for a claim
of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically
equivalent claim can be avoided (i) in the event it provided security, if the act was effected in the
last ten years prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or
(ii) in the event it resulted in satisfaction, if the act was effected in the last year prior to the filing of
a petition for commencement of opening proceedings or thereafter; or

    - a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an
economically equivalent claim to a third party can be avoided if the transaction was effected in the
last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a
shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case
the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from

which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., an entity subject to the German insolvency laws) was
subject to illiquidity, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed, or that the act was
detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. Knowledge of pending
restructuring proceedings (see￿Preventive Restructuring Framework) per se does not suffice for a creditor to be
deemed to have such “knowledge.” A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice
the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the
debtor’s creditors. With respect to a “related party”, there is a general statutory presumption that such party had
“knowledge.”

If the Guarantee given by the German Guarantor were avoided or held unenforceable for any reason, a
holder of the Notes would cease to have any claim or benefit in respect thereof. Any amounts received from a
transaction that has been avoided would have to be repaid to the insolvent estate and a holder of the Notes would
have a claim solely under the Notes, if any.

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash

transaction” and may as such be exempted—under certain circumstances—under the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg) from avoidance rights.

The Act on the Temporary Adaptation of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate

Crisis Consequences (Sanierungs- und insolvenzrechtliches Krisenfolgenabmilderungsgesetz (“SanInsKG”),
that has incorporated the former Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit
Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19_Insolvenzaussetzungsgesetz)), however, provides for privileged treatment of new financing and shareholder loans_
under German insolvency law claw-back provisions during a certain time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On
that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans
by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing was granted
between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the
filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing
providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral to secure the repayment of shareholder loans
or receivables resulting from legal transactions which are economically equivalent to a loan.

Any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan approved by the relevant court (see—
“Pre-Insolvency Restructuring Plan”) are not subject to avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring
(nachhaltige Sanierung) of the debtor is achieved, unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or
incomplete information presented by the debtor and the addressee of the avoidance action had knowledge thereof.
This privilege does not apply to shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral provided
therefor.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained

an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy
of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to avoid certain transactions, such as the payment of debt
and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The prerequisites
for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) differ to a certain extent from the rules
described above under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) and the avoidance periods are calculated
from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted a new directive, which aims
to ensure that minimum restructuring measures are available in the Member States to enable debtors in financial
distress to solve their problems at an early stage and to avoid formal insolvency proceedings (Directive of the
European Parliament and the Council EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of
debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring,
insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the “Preventive Restructuring
**Directive”)).**

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further
Development of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws (Gesetz zur Fortentwicklung des Sanierungs_und Insolvenzrechts), which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law is the introduction_
of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (Unternehmensstabilisierungs- und_restrukturierungsgesetz) (“Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act”), which establishes a_
comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Company
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the
respective debtor to affected creditors and/or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des
_Restrukturierungsvorhabens). Restructuring Proceedings are applicable in cases in which a debtor faces imminent_
illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), i.e., that there is the imminent risk for the debtor of being unable to
pay any of its debt as and when it falls due during the course of (regularly) the next 24 months.

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon
the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is likely that
the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over the next 24 months. The
debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act.
Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are
met (see above under “—Insolvency”).

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not
necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company
Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s
liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In

422


-----

addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under
the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be
kept to a minimum and the tools can — under certain circumstances — even be used without the need for any
public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilization
and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an
important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by entities that are
connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilization and
Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which
implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (see above under “—Insolvency”).

The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring
of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest
rates and/or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release
of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent and sister
companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved
by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes.
The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the
voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the
security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However,
if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if
creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court
confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown).

The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the
debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools
include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such
stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially
be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order
up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under
the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act by the Issuer, a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor
having its center of main interest in Germany would be the following:

    - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only
limited review and/or supervision by a court;

    - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period
of up to eight months due to a stabilization order;

    - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised
by the restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or
interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of
the ranking of the security right);

    - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring
Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

    - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of
the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class
cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes.

Restructuring plans which are made public and confirmed by a German restructuring court pursuant to
the rules set out in the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act (applying as of July 17, 2022) will be
recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation (EU)
2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings) upon such
proceeding being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. In any other case, the
recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international
private law.

423


-----

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against
the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied,
ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors, in the following order and, with claims of equal ranking,
in proportion to their relative amounts: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency
creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors
due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines,
as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay
money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a
shareholder loan replacing equity capital or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic
terms to such a loan.

The SanInsKG, however, suspends the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from
economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for up until September 30, 2023 for newly granted
shareholder loans that were granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and where the debtor fulfilled the
requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time.

**_Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantee and the Security Interests_**

The German Guarantor is incorporated in Germany in the form of a German limited liability company

(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung or “GmbH”). Consequently, the granting of collateral such as Guarantees
of the Notes by the German Guarantors is subject to certain limitations under the German Limited Liability
Company Act (the Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”), including rules
on capital maintenance. These provisions would also apply to any future German Guarantor in the form of a
GmbH or a partnership with a limited liability company as general partner (Komplementär) (“GmbH & Co. KG”).

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets less
liabilities and liability reserves)—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets—is or would
fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its stated share capital
(Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees or security interests granted by a GmbH or a GmbH
& Co. KG in order to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements
under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and to provide
security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating
Sections 30 and 31 and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market practice for
credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in
relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to
such “limitation language”, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or security interests contractually agree to enforce
the guarantees and security interests against the German subsidiary only if and to the extent that such enforcement
does not result in the subsidiary’s—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—net assets falling
below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital and thereby violating Sections 30 and 31.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the Indenture and security documents, to the extent
provided by a Guarantor incorporated in Germany in a corporate form as referred to above, contain or will contain
a contractual limitation language. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee granted by such
Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. German capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. We cannot
assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of the Guarantors
constituted in the form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to
make payment on the Notes or of the Guarantors to make payments on the related Notes Guarantee.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a
situation where a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment
obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee granted by a German
Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced,
potentially even to zero.

_According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement_
may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial
situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital

424


-----

interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with
respect to the granting of guarantees by any of the Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction
effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the guarantee could become personally liable
under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could
be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of
the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention
could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor
of the guarantee and/or collateral was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with
respect thereto.

**_Accessory Security Interests/Parallel Debt_**

Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature
and are therefore dependent on the secured claims and require the security holder and the creditor of the secured
claim to be identical. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically
lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently, but
would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned and (iii) may
only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest.

The accessory security interests will also be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is
however not a creditor under the Notes. The holders on the other hand are creditors under the Notes. In order to
allow the holders to benefit from the pledges, such pledges will also secure a so called “parallel debt” obligation
created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the holders’ claims
under the Notes directly. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations
of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantee (the “Principal Obligations”), and any
payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment
in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent
will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount
of the Notes, the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts or that it will eliminate
or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to
enforce the collateral may be restricted.

Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of
the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully
claim that there is no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the holders with respect to the secured claims.
However, the relevant grantor of security would still be able to do so (to the extent the relevant assets and claims
are still existent and part of the (gross) insolvency estate).

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the
asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting
periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the
collateral gives the security agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security
from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of
security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds
from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the
court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

**The Netherlands**

**_Dutch Insolvency Law_**

Where debtors have their center of main interests or an “establishment” in the Netherlands they may
become subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency laws. This is particularly relevant
to a Guarantor which is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (a “Dutch Guarantor”) and has its
statutory seat (statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands, and which is therefore presumed (subject to proof to the
contrary and exceptions under the Insolvency Regulation) to have its center of main interests in the Netherlands.
See further “European Union” above. In the event it was determined by the court that a Dutch Guarantor has its
centre of main interests outside of the EU, the Dutch Guarantor may still be subjected to insolvency proceedings
in the Netherlands due to the fact that the Insolvency Regulation would not apply. In that event, the Dutch courts

425


-----

can claim jurisdiction based on the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) because the Dutch Guarantor has
its statutory seat in the Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in
the Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not incorporated under Dutch
law.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are three primary
insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to
facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The
second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the
assets of a debtor to its creditors. The third, the Dutch Scheme, which allows a debtor to offer a composition
outside of formal insolvency proceedings such as suspension of payments or bankruptcy. All insolvency regimes
are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a suspension of payments often results
in bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below.

_Suspension of Payments_

An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it
will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a court
will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A
meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord)
is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition
will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium.

If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional
moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one
quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of
the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non preferential creditors
withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the
debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor
will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The fact that the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors
does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example,
by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition).

The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non preferential creditors. Unlike
Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are
generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under Dutch law
secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against
assets of the company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of
payments. A recovery under Dutch law could therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going
concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party the court can order a “cooling down
period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for
another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred.
Also in a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition
will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the
number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that
are acknowledged and admitted in the moratorium, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court.
Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the noteholders to effect a
restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments proceeding.
Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in
a composition.

_Bankruptcy_

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy
can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the
aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable.
The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself.

During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds
distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general
principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all

426


-----

creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in
proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and
social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors.
Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.

The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in
accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their terms on
the date of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor incorporated under Dutch law will be accelerated and become due and
payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver (curator) to be
verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether
and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the purpose of the distribution of the
proceeds. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy
proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the
bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may
be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering),
the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of
other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to
separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the
principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such renvooi
proceedings could also cause payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed
claims. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition (akkoord) may
be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a
simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in
amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently ratified
(gehomologeerd) by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the
concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential
creditors are distributed among the unsecured non preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis.
Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual
effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a
Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the supervisory judge
(rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended
once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless
such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy
receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing
which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in
the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned
to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the
bankruptcy. An exception applies in the case of set off relating to a payment to the pledgor, not made during its
bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee, although a
set off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in
obtaining the claim used for set off. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a
debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the
obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations,
enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect)
can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its
trustee in bankruptcy. See below “—Fraudulent Transfer.”

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of
judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured
creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously
with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the
liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees
granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle,
litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

_Pre-insolvency plan_

As regards the pre-insolvency plan regime, debtors have the possibility to offer a composition outside of
formal insolvency proceedings under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet

427


-----

_homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans”). The pre-_
insolvency plan regime has been incorporated in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act pursuant to this Act on Court
Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans. Unlike a moratorium and in bankruptcy, a composition under
the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as
shareholders. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides, inter alia, for cross
class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned proceedings,
the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of ipso facto, and supporting court measures. Such
composition may result in claims against the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantor as compromised if the relevant
majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favor of such a composition. A composition plan
under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can extend to claims against entities
that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the Act on
Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can affect the rights of noteholders.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans voting on a composition plan
is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third of the claims of
that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the shares of that class
that have voted on the plan. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides for the
possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross class cramdown). Under the Act
on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least
one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of
a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter
_alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting_
class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can
be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a nonconsenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual
ranking and priority to the detriment of that class.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay on
enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. During such period, inter
_alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action_
to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect
nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

If a Dutch private limited liability company or public limited liability company grants a guarantee or
security interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s corporate interest, the guarantee or
security interest may be nullified by the relevant Dutch company, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in bankruptcy
(faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van
_betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and enforceable against it. In determining_
whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would
not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the company but all
relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause
derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was
granted and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such
transaction. In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the
transactions for the company that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may
challenge the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be
successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company
as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In
addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity
of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It
remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may
be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of
the relevant company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of
the company between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above also
applies with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the
document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress
(bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment pursuant to a

428


-----

guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation
occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure
(niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding
factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening).

Dutch law provides a special set of proceedings in relation to the settlement of disputes within a company.
These special proceedings are known as inquiry proceedings (enquêteprocedures). Inquiry proceedings are used
to address conflicts such as a director’s misconduct or internal conflicts between shareholders. Inquiry
proceedings are held before the Enterprise Court at The Amsterdam Court of Appeal (Ondernemingskamer van
_het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam). The Enterprise Court has extensive powers in resolving disputes and restoring_
balance within a company by way of injunctions or provisional injunctions, which can include suspension or
avoidance of a guarantee in whole or in part.

**_Enforcement of Security Interests_**

In the event of the occurrence of certain events, the Security Agent may enforce the security interests
created pursuant to the relevant security documents governed by Dutch law. A secured creditor may, in principle,
enforce its security as if there are no insolvency proceedings. This is subject to limited exceptions, including that
(i) the court may impose a moratorium which may not exceed four months, during which pledgees may not
exercise their rights, (ii) the liquidator in bankruptcy may fix a period within which the pledgee must exercise
their rights. If the pledgee does not enforce its security rights during this period, the trustee in bankruptcy will
become exclusively entitled to enforcement. However, even in such a situation, the pledgee will retain its priority
in respect of the proceeds but will need to contribute pro rata to the general bankruptcy costs. The same applies
in situations where there is a suspension of payment, and (iii) a court may suspend, for a period not exceeding
eight months, enforcement of security rights against a pledgor in relation to which statutory proceedings for the
restructuring of debts (akkoordprocedure) have been started. In general, under Dutch insolvency law mortgages
and pledges rank above other rights of priority (other than senior ranking security and other liens), including the
general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, Dutch law provides for
exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a nonpossessory pledge on inventory (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken).
Schemes often used to interfere with these tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the debtor’s premises
(bodemverhuurconstructie), have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this
scheme, now must inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of
four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been informed.

Under Dutch law the following rules generally apply to the enforcement of a pledge. A pledge must be
enforced in one of the following four ways, being (i) a public sale ('auction'), (ii) a private sale by the pledgee to
a third party (a) either with the consent of the pledgor and any other interested party (such as the holder of a junior
ranking pledge, or conservatory or executory attachment), or (b) with the approval of the competent court, (iii)
accrual of the pledged asset to the pledgee ('appropriation') with the approval of the competent court for a price
determined by that court, or (iv) in the event of rights of pledge on receivables, by collecting the receivables and
having recourse against the amounts so collected. A public auction has to be effected in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure
(Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch private company with limited
liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in
accordance with Dutch law and the relevant pledged company’s articles of association as they read at the time of
foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge on claims can, in principle, only be enforced (through collection of the
claims) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor. The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right)
the relevant security provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets.
In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant security provider may agree to an alternative
enforcement procedure once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the
competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor
of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel
Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of
Additional Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, and a pledge under any Dutch share pledge will be
granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in

429


-----

Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch
share pledge posed by Dutch law.

To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch share pledge is successfully challenged,
holders of Additional Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a
Dutch share pledge. In addition, the holders of Additional Notes bear the risks associated with the possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a person, including a guarantee or security
interest granted by a legal entity, may under certain circumstances, be nullified by any of its creditors, if (i) the
legal act or the guarantee or security interest was granted without prior existing legal obligation to do so
(onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned was/were prejudiced as a consequence of the legal act or the guarantee
or the granting of the security interest and (iii) at the time the legal act or the guarantee or security interest was
granted both the legal entity and, unless the legal act or the guarantee or security interest was granted for no
consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors
(existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a
transaction or a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver (curator) on behalf of
and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the transaction or
the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors
of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration.
The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when
invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge
the transaction or the guarantee or security interest if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal
obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) such transaction was conducted at a time that the
counterparty of knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a
result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty with a view to give preference to the counterparty
over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions by a Dutch legal entity may
be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. If a Dutch court found that the granting
of a guarantee or security interest or any other transaction entered into by the Issuer or a Guarantor at any time in
connection with the Notes involved a fraudulent transfer as set out above, then the granting of a guarantee or
security interest or any other transaction entered into by the Issuer or a Guarantor could be nullified. In the case
of successful challenge, holders of the Notes would not enjoy the benefit of such guarantee or security interest.

It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares
can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor. If a security right is created on collateral
to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will not be subject to such a
security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title
thereto.

It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if created,
in respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a Dutch private limited
liability company which should be registered in its shareholders’ register. However, this does not constitute
conclusive evidence of the absence of any pre-existing security.

**Spain**

**_Limitations on validity and enforcement of guarantees and securities granted by any Spanish subsidiary_**

_Limitation on claims_

Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (5 years being the general term established for
obligations in personam under article 1,964 of Royal Decree of 24 July 1889 approving the Spanish civil code
(Real Decreto de 24 de julio de 1889 por el que se publica el Código Civil), (as amended and restated from time
to time, the “Spanish Civil Code”), or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

_Court enforceability_

The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any
combination thereof) mean that all the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents
are of a type enforced by Spanish Courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced

430


-----

in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement before the Courts will in any event
be subject to:

    - the nature of the remedies available in the Courts;

    - Spanish public policy rules (orden público);

    - article 1,851 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that an extension granted to a debtor by a creditor
without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guarantee (in the sense that it is limited to the
original term, although case law has established exceptions where the extension benefits both the
debtor and the guarantor);

    - the guarantor may not be required to pay any amount in excess of the amount owed by the principal
debtor or under conditions that are less favorable than those applying to the principal debtor; and

    - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation), set-off (unless validly waived), fraud
(fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure,
unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counter-claim.

**_Financial assistance limitations_**

The obligations under any guarantee or security granted by a Spanish guarantor (the “Spanish
**Guarantor”) in the form of a public limited company (sociedad anónima)** shall (i) not extend to any obligation
incurred by any company of the Group for the purposes of (a) acquiring shares representing the share capital of
such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of the parent company of such Spanish Guarantor
(or, in case of a private limited liability company (sociedad de responsabilidad limitada), also shares representing
the share capital of any entity of its Group); or (b) refinancing a previous debt incurred by any company of the
Group for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing
the share capital of the parent company of such Spanish Guarantor (or, in case of a private limited liability
company (sociedad de responsabilidad limitada), also shares representing the share capital of any entity of its
Group), and shall (ii) be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by a Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the
same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of article 150 (for Spanish public limited
companies (sociedades anónimas)) or article 143 (for the Spanish private limited liability companies (sociedades
_de responsabilidad limitada)) of Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010, of July 2, approving the Spanish Companies_
Act (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de
_Sociedades de Capital), (as amended and restated from time to time, the “Spanish Companies Law”), and, in no_
case, can any of the Guarantees or security interests given by a Spanish Guarantor secure or guarantee repayment
of the abovementioned funds.

For the purposes of the paragraph above, a reference to a “parent company” of a Spanish Guarantor shall
mean the company which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the voting rights of such Spanish Guarantor
or that may have a dominant influence on such Spanish Guarantor. It shall be presumed that one company has a
dominant influence on another company when any of the scenarios set out in section 1 of article 42 of Royal
Decree of 22 August 1885 approving the Spanish Commercial Code (Real Decreto de 22 de agosto de 1885 por
_el que se publica el Código de Comercio) are met._

**_Limitations to notes’ guarantees or security interest_**

Under the Spanish Companies Law, Spanish companies (both public limited companies (sociedades
_anónimas) and private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada)) may issue and_
guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities that recognize or create debt,
with certain restrictions applicable to private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad
_limitada). In particular, pursuant to article 401 of the Spanish Companies Law, an Spanish Guarantor incorporated_
as a private limited liability company (sociedad de responsabilidad limitada) can issue or guarantee notes or any
other debt securities subject to the following limitations (a) the issuance can only be up to an aggregate maximum
amount of twice its own equity (recursos propios), unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge over
securities, a guarantee granted by a public body or a joint and several guarantee given by a credit institution and
(b) the company is prohibited from granting a guarantee (or providing security for) notes convertible into quota
shares (participaciones sociales).

431


-----

It is not clear among scholars whether the abovementioned limitation referred to in (a) above, as imposed
by article 401 of the Spanish Companies Law, shall also be applicable to in rem security or guarantees provided
by private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada) in respect to notes’ issuances. To
the extent that any court may rule that the limitation set forth in this section shall also apply to the guarantee or
provision for security of notes by Spanish companies incorporated under the form of limited liability companies
(sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), the guarantee or any security interest provided by any Spanish
Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Spain as a limited liability company shall be limited accordingly. The
aforementioned limitations shall apply _mutatis mutandi in the scenarios stated above to any other Security_
Document granted by a Spanish Guarantor.

**_Corporate benefit_**

All acts and transactions performed and carried out by a Spanish company must be in pursuit of and
aligned with its corporate benefit and interest and, in particular, directors have a duty to act in the best interest of
the company, although there is no express mandatory law provision that requires an express and direct corporate
benefit. The absence of such corporate benefit and interest may constitute grounds to challenge such acts and
transactions. In addition, directors’ liability may be triggered. When assessing whether or not directors have acted
in the best interest of the company, only the interest of such company is taken into account. Accordingly,
transactions undertaken for the benefit of the Group may not always be considered consistent with the best interest
of the company.

In the context of upstream and cross-stream guarantees, the Spanish Supreme Court (Tribunal Supremo)
has ruled that the subsidiary granting the guarantee or security interest to secure the debt of its parent company or
other company of its Group should receive some kind of consideration or benefit, either directly or indirectly, to
compensate the financial burden assumed in the interest of the Group. This compensation (i) must be verifiable,
even if it is not received simultaneously to the granting of the guarantee or security; (ii) must be adequate and
proportional to the burden assumed by the relevant company in the interest of its Group; and (iii) must have an
economic value. Furthermore, the action undertaken in the interest of the Group shall be justified and shall not
put the solvency of the subsidiary at risk.

**_Capitalization_**

Under Spanish law there are some provisions on capitalization which have to be taken into account when
guarantees are enforced. For example, as imposed by section 1 of article 363 of the Spanish Companies Law,
when the enforcement of the guarantee causes the amount of the relevant Spanish subsidiary net equity
(patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up
(disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the balance
between its net equity and its share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency. Pursuant
to the special regulations approved in the context of COVID-19, among others the Royal Decree-Law 27/2021,
of November 23, extending certain measures to support economic recovery (Real Decreto-ley 27/2021, de 23 de
_noviembre, por el que se prorrogan determinadas medidas económicas para apoyar la recuperación) there is an_
interim regime whereby any losses incurred during financial years 2020 and 2021 will not be taken into account
to determine if a Spanish company is in a capital impairment situation. If the losses incurred in 2022 result in a
capital impairment situation of the company, the directors shall call the general shareholders’ meeting within two
months following closing of such financial year. In addition, and while this remains a matter debated between
Spanish scholars, it is possible that certain defenses available to the Spanish Guarantor relating to corporate
benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, capital preservation or thin capitalization may
limit the amount guaranteed under the Guarantee by reference to the net assets and share capital of the Spanish
Guarantor and the amount secured under the relevant security agreement by reference to the value of the collateral.

**_Trust under Spanish law_**

Spanish law does not recognize the concept of security trustees and, therefore, trust structures may not
be recognized by Spanish Courts. In this case, there is a risk that a Spanish Court would consider a security given
for the benefit of a security trustee as a number of concurrent, independent securities, each of them securing the
rights of each of the individual beneficiaries of the trust. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the
Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish
Court would recognize the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee’s actions in an enforcement situation.

Under Spanish law there is some uncertainty (a) if the beneficial owners of the Notes that are not
identified as registered holders in the security agreement will be deemed to have a valid and perfected security

432


-----

interest under such security and (b) with respect to the validity of any security interest created in favor of the
Security Agent under the Notes on behalf of the holders of the Notes. Therefore, there is a risk that the Security
Agent would only be able to enforce against the debt it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to
creditors for whom it is acting as security agent. This limitation may be overcome if the Noteholders grant formal
powers of attorney (duly notarized and, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention
of October 5, 1961) in favor of the Security Agent in order for the latter to represent them in the enforcement
proceedings.

In the absence of the abovementioned power of attorney, the Security Agent may not be able to enforce
the relevant Spanish security interest on behalf of all of the secured creditors (including the holders of the Notes).
Further, those beneficial holders of the security who has not accepted the security or duly empowered (by means
of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) the Security Agent to do so may be treated, from a Spanish law
perspective including without limitation in an insolvency scenario, as unsecured creditors.

Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through
the Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has not
been tested before the Spanish Courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not expressly
contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and several creditor does not hold a portion of
the secured obligation itself. As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to represent the applicable Trustee and
the holders of the Notes may be challenged.

Further, it is worth noting that there is a risk that the relevant court or notary public before whom any
Spanish security interest may eventually be enforced might request both the notarization of the documents from
which the relevant obligations arise, and the notarization of each and every one of the transfer certificates
regarding each and every transfer of the Notes. Without notarization of the security documents, the secured parties
will not have access to the executive summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of
the security documents in Spain, having the secured parties to follow necessarily the ordinary judicial proceedings
(juicio ordinario).

**_Parallel debt_**

The concept of “parallel debt” may be questioned under Spanish law and we are not aware of any
precedent where it has been recognized by a Spanish Court. Therefore, we cannot assure you that by creating any
such structure it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by such applicable law. If any
challenge to the validity, perfection or enforceability of the security interests created by the relevant Security
Documents were successful, the holders of the Notes may be unable to enforce such security interests.

Also, under Spanish law, in the event that the relevant obligor enters into insolvency proceedings, the
securities or the parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator,
the obligor itself or by other creditors of such obligor under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Spanish
insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the relevant
obligor.

**_First demand guarantee_**

The figure of a first demand guarantee has been admitted in several judgments by the Spanish Supreme
Court (Tribunal Supremo) as an autonomous guarantee, detached from the underlying agreement whose
obligations are being guaranteed, acknowledging therefore the validity of the provision pursuant to which the
guarantor has renounced to call on exceptions different to those arising from the guarantee. Notwithstanding this,
case law has also admitted the possibility that the guarantor objects to the beneficiary of the guarantee the
exception of fraud (fraude de ley), bad faith (mala fe) or abuse of right (abuso de derecho) in the events where
the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a fraudulent manner or with bad faith. Besides, case law has also admitted
that the guarantor can stay the enforcement by showing that there has been no event of default (the guarantor
bearing the burden of proof).

**_Insolvency proceedings_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Spain and of the limitations
applicable to the guarantees provided by the Spanish Guarantor.

433


-----

_Spanish Insolvency Law_

Law 16/2022, of September 5, amending Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020 of May 5 (Ley 16/2002, de 5
_de septiembre, de reforma del texto refundido de la Ley Concursal) (as amended from time to time, the “Spanish_
**Insolvency Law”) was enacted to restate and improve the previous legal framework governing insolvency in**
Spain, with the aim of implementing the restructuring framework required by Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the
European Parliament and of the Council, of 20 June 2019, on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge
of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring,
insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and
insolvency), as well as otherwise significantly amending the previous insolvency law. The amendments to the
Spanish Insolvency Law came into force, subject to certain exceptions, on 26 September 2022.

The Spanish Insolvency Law regulates insolvency court-supervised proceedings, as opposed to out-ofcourt liquidation (which, pursuant to Spanish Companies Law, is only available when the debtor has sufficient
assets to meet its liabilities or in specific situations regulated under the Spanish Insolvency Law). The Spanish
full-blown insolvency proceeding (insolvencia), which is referred to as “concurso de acreedores”, applies to all
persons or entities (save for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the Spanish Insolvency Law). These
proceedings may lead either to reorganization through the implementation of an agreement between the creditors
and the debtor (convenio) (the “Composition Agreement”) or to the liquidation of the debtor’s assets
(liquidación).

_Insolvency Filing_

A debtor (in the case of a company, its directors) is required to file the insolvency petition upon inability
to regularly pay its liabilities as they become due (insolvencia actual). As a general rule, a debtor has to file for
voluntary insolvency within two months from the date on which it knew, or should have known, that it was in an
insolvency situation. The debtor is also entitled (but not required) to apply for such insolvency proceedings when
it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they become due (insolvencia inminente). According to the
amendments to the Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is in an imminent insolvency scenario when it foresees its
inability to regularly pay liabilities as they will become due in the next three months.

Creditors do also have standing to petition mandatory insolvency (concurso necesario) when the debtor
is unable to regularly pay its debts as they come due (i.e., only in an actual insolvency scenario).

Insolvency is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. If the debtor requests the
insolvency, it must prove its current or imminent insolvency. The debtor must file a petition for insolvency within
two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of actual insolvency (inability to
regularly pay the debts as they come due). It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless
otherwise proven, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency
occur. Where the debtor fails to file a petition for insolvency within the time period established by law (two
months), (i) the directors may be removed from office and substituted by an insolvency authority once the
insolvency is declared and the insolvency process is initiated; (ii) the debtor may be unable to exercise certain
courses of action; and (iii) the directors may be held liable for the impaired claims accrued as from the consent of
insolvency (responsabilidad concursal), should the debtor be liquidated and insolvency be classified as “guilty”
(concurso culpable).

Insolvency is considered mandatory (concurso necesario) if filed by a third party and upheld by the
Court. Under section 4 of article 2 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration of
insolvency if it can prove that the debtor has failed to attach or seize any assets, or sufficient assets, to pay the
amount owed. A creditor may also apply for a debtor’s insolvency if it can prove to the Court (i) a generalized
default on payments by the debtor, (ii) a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s
assets, (iii) a misplacement, “fire sale”, hasty, loss-making or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets or (iv) a
generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory
period (i.e., three months).

The general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two months does not apply if, by means of the
communication that is foreseen under article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the so-called 5 _bis_
communication by reference to a previous regulation –Law 22/2003–), the debtor who is in actual, imminent or
likely insolvency, and has not been declared in insolvency, notifies the Court that it has started negotiations with
its creditors to seek support for a “restructuring plan” (the “Plan”), in which case it will have an additional grace
period of three months and one more to file for insolvency. Such grace period of three months could be extended

434


-----

if, not later than at the end of the initial three-month grace period, either the debtor, or creditors holding more than
50% of the debts that the Plan may affect at that time (net of any credits that would qualify as subordinated
(acreedor subordinado) claims in an insolvency situation), may request the Court for a three-month extension,
provided the restructuring expert, if one is appointed, issues a favorable report in support of the request.

The new law introduces the concept of “likelihood of insolvency” (probabilidad de insolvencia), which
is when it is objectively foreseeable that the debtor will be unable to regularly fulfil its obligations that fall due in
the next two years unless it enters into a Plan with its creditors. In addition to being able to start negotiating with
its creditors with a view to entering into a Plan at any time during this period when insolvency is likely, the debtor
will also be able to file for pre-insolvency in court, in which case it will inform the applicable Court that it is
trying to negotiate a Plan with its creditors.

_Pre-Insolvency filing_

Spanish law contains a restructuring moratorium proceeding, which is an insolvency proceeding under
both Spanish and European regulations. It protects the debtor, for a four-months period (or up to seven months, if
extended), from petitions for mandatory insolvency proceedings.

As mentioned above, the general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two-months period does
not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable Court that it has initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain
support for a Plan, as set out in articles 614 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law. Effectively, by means of the
communication that is foreseen under article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the so-called 5 _bis_
communication by reference to a previous regulation –Law 22/2003–), on the top of those two months, the debtor
gains an additional three-months period (or up to six months, if extended) as from the date when the debtor gives
such notice, to achieve a Plan with its creditors and one further month to file for insolvency, if the above mentioned
period of three months (or of six months if extended) has elapsed without an agreement being reached and the
situation of insolvency persists.

Additionally, during the three-month protection period provided by the pre-insolvency filing (or six
months in case it has been extended under the new insolvency regime), enforcement actions are stayed, subject to
the following:

- As a general rule, neither judicial nor extrajudicial enforcement proceedings may be initiated to seize or
attach assets or rights that the debtor requires (the so-called “necessary assets”) to continue its
professional or business activities. Previously initiated enforcement proceedings will be stayed. It is not
always easy to determine when an asset is necessary to operate the business and the courts decide on a
case-by-case basis. They normally take a flexible approach and consider elements such as cash or credit
rights as assets that are necessary to continue to run the business. However, creditors may challenge the
court clerk’s asset qualification, which the Court will hear.

- At the debtor’s request, the Court may extend these stays in relation to one or several creditors or class
of creditors in respect of other assets or rights, even if they are not deemed “necessary assets”, if doing
so could help bring the negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion, provided the restructuring expert, if one
has been appointed, has given its consent. The Court decision on this suspension may be challenged by
a remedy (recurso de reposición), exclusively.

- Subject to the above, enforcing security in rem over “necessary assets” may be initiated but will be
automatically stayed. However, neither financial collateral governed by Royal Decree-Law 5/2005,
March 11, on urgent reforms for the encouragement of productivity and the improvement of government
procurement (Real Decreto-Ley 5/2005, de 11 de marzo, de reformas urgentes para el impulso de la
_productividad y para la mejora de la contratación pública) (the “RDL 5/2005”), nor in rem security_
interests over assets located in another Member State (other than Denmark) should be affected by this
suspension.

In relation to the above provisions, Spanish Courts may apply them, under certain circumstances, in
relation to assets held by non-Spanish affiliates of the entity that files for pre-insolvency, with effects outside of
Spain.

In any case, the above regime does not apply to public credit rights (créditos de derecho público). In
such case, enforcement can be suspended in very limited circumstances and, in any case, up to a maximum period
of three months.

435


-----

Also, while the effects of pre-insolvency are in force, according to the amended Spanish Insolvency Law,
directors’ legal duty to wind up the company in the event of a capital impairment situation (i.e., its net equity is
below a half of its share capital) is suspended.

In case of essential contracts for the viability of the business, the relevant counterparties will not be
entitled to suspend, amend or early terminate such contract for contractual breaches occurred prior to the
communication that is foreseen under article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the so-called 5 _bis_
communication by reference to a previous regulation –Law 22/2003–) while the effects of such communication
are in force (even if the relevant contracts allowed it).

Filing for pre-insolvency has also the following effects:

- _Over credit rights. Pre-insolvency does not cause itself the early maturity of claims. Contractual_
provisions amending or declaring the early maturity of claims in case of pre-insolvency shall become
ineffective.

- _Over contracts. Any contractual provisions declaring the early termination, suspension or amendment of_
a contract with outstanding reciprocal obligations in case of pre-insolvency or analogous proceedings
shall be rendered ineffective. This will not be applicable for contractual netting agreements (acuerdos de
_compensación contractual) subject to RDL 5/2005._

**_Restructuring Plan_**

Under the amended Spanish Insolvency Law, the effects of a Plan can be imposed on all types of creditors
and claims (subject to specific and limited exceptions) such as financial claims, non-financial claims (including
trading and operating debt and public claims subject to strict requirements), one or multiple classes of creditors
and, where applicable, even debtor’s shareholders. In particular, claims held by public creditors (e.g., tax
authorities, and the Social Security) cannot be subject to a haircut, debt-for-equity swap, change of debtor or
change of governing law. According to this special regime, as a general rule, their maturity can be extended up to
12 months since the issuance of the homologation ruling and up to 6 months since the issuance of the
homologation ruling if a deferral or division in instalments (aplazamiento o fraccionamiento de pago) of such
debt has been agreed with the public administration.

The Plan must include a minimum content set out in article 633 of the Spanish Insolvency Law and will
need to be formalized in a public document (formalizado en instrumento público).

In addition, as opposed to the previous Spanish insolvency law, which only allowed a closed-ended list
of measures to be imposed on dissenting creditors, a Plan under the Spanish Insolvency Law may contain almost
any restructuring alternative, provided it is sufficient and proportionate to ensure the viability of the business and
its continuation as a going concern. The debtor and its creditors may agree on any type of measure deemed
necessary to effectively restructure the debtor’s business, including changes in the composition, conditions or
structure –not only of the debtor’s liabilities, but also of its assets or any part of its capital structure. This could
include sales of assets, parts of the business or even the entire business as a going concern, as well as any other
necessary operational changes, or a combination of the same. The Plan must nevertheless set out the reasons why
it has a “reasonable prospect of preventing the insolvency” of the debtor and ensuring the viability of its business
in the short and medium term, including the necessary pre-conditions for its success.

In addition, the mere judicial approval of a Plan does not affect bilateral contracts with outstanding
reciprocal obligations at that time, they remain in force. Moreover, contracts that are deemed necessary to ensure
the continuity of the debtor’s business cannot be terminated, suspended or amended due to a change in control of
the debtor as a result of a debt-for-equity swap contemplated by the Plan. However, the Spanish Insolvency Law
specifies certain exceptions to the principle of continuation of bilateral contracts that aim to ensure a Plan’s
success, in particular, in relation to: (i) executory contracts (i.e., contracts with outstanding bilateral obligations);
(ii) contracts with senior executives; (iii) financial collateral arrangements and/or netting arrangements; and (iv)
trade supply agreements.

On a separate note, class formation has been introduced by the amended Spanish Insolvency Law.
Creditors affected by the Plan will be grouped into classes. The class formation criteria must be based on a
common interest shared by each group of creditors.

As a general rule, it is presumed that creditors with the same ranking in an insolvency process share a
common interest, but they can also be separated into different classes if there are reasons justifying such split

436


-----

(e.g., financial and non-financial nature, conflicts of interests among creditors of different classes or measures to
be imposed by the Plan). In any case, secured claims must constitute a single class, unless the different nature of
the collateral justifies the creation of separate classes. Claims governed by public law will also constitute a
separate class among the classes with the same ranking.

**_Request of joint insolvency_**

The insolvency of a company forming part of a Group of companies, including the parent company, does
not automatically lead to the insolvency of the remaining companies of the Group, however, creditors may apply
for a joint insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors (declaración conjunta de concursos) if either
(a) there is a confusion of assets among them, or (b) they form part of the same Group of companies. Therefore,
the request for the joint insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the
relevant companies and each of the affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may
also be requested by the companies themselves provided that they form part of the same Group.

Any of the debtors, or the insolvency administrator, as the case may be, may apply for the procedural
consolidation of insolvency proceedings already declared under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the
debtors form part of the same Group of companies). In addition, creditors may apply for the procedural
consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of two or more of its debtors already declared (acumulación de
_concursos) if either (a) there is a confusion of assets among them, or (b) they form part of the same Group of_
companies, provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency
administrator.

Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated are processed in coordination, without
consolidation of the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a general rule, a “group insolvency” does
not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such Group. This means that the creditors of one
company of the Group will not have recourse against other companies of the same Group (except where cross
guarantees exist, in which case such a claim might be subordinated). The current system is basically a procedural
one, aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost efficient as possible. However, exceptionally,
and for the purpose of the drafting of the insolvency report, by the insolvency administrator only, assets and
liabilities amongst the companies declared insolvent may be consolidated where there is a confusion of states and
assets and liabilities belonging to each of the companies cannot be identified, in order to avert unjustified cost and
delay.

_Enforcement and termination in a pre-insolvency scenario_

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees might not necessarily be enforced in accordance
with their respective terms in every circumstance, such enforcement being subject to, inter alia, the nature of the
remedies available in the Spanish Courts, the acceptance by such Court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the Courts,
the power of such Courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law (Ley 1/2000, de
_7 de enero de Enjuiciamiento Civil) (the “Spanish Civil Procedure Law”) regarding remedies and enforcement_
measures available under Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Law and other principles of law
of general application. In this regard:

          - Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity nor the concept
of punitive damages. In principle, the legal remedy which will be awarded under
Spanish law is compensation for damages (indemnización de daños). Article 1,152 of
the Spanish Civil Code establishes that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the
parties will substitute damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest
(abono de intereses) in an event of breach, unless otherwise agreed. Spanish Courts
may modify the penalty agreed on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or
irregularly performed its obligations, unless the penalty (liquidated damages) was
aimed at such partial performance (and in any event if it is deemed to be
disproportionate according to the good faith principle). There is doubt as to the
enforceability in Spain of punitive damages.

          - Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be
enforceable in Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of
Spain.

437


-----

          - Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be
left at the discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish Courts may
refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary
authority to one of the contracting parties.

          - Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court (Tribunal Supremo), precludes
an agreement being terminated on the basis of a breach of obligations, undertakings or
covenants which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings
foreseen under the relevant agreement (such as payment obligations under financing
agreements), and allows Spanish Courts not to enforce any such termination.

          - Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision
whenever said acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be
deemed to have been executed in circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the
provisions whose application was intended to be avoided shall apply.

          - Spanish Courts may award damages if the specific performance of an obligation is
deemed impracticable.

          - Spanish Courts may modify the obligations deriving from contracts in the terms
considered necessary in order to restore the balance between the obligations, if
unexpected and exceptional circumstances arise that were unforeseeable when the
contracts were executed, which would have been expressly or implicitly assumed.

**_Effects of Insolvency Declaration_**

_Effects for the Debtor_

As a general rule, the debtor in a voluntary case retains its management power, but is subject to the
intervention (intervención) of the insolvency trustee (administrador concursal), who is appointed by the Court.
In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management will be replaced (sustitución) by
the insolvency trustee. However, the Court has the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific
circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the insolvency trustee’s request, the Court has the power to swap the
intervention regime (regimen de intervención) for a suspension regime (regimen de suspensión) or vice versa.
Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required supervision of the insolvency authorities may be
declared null and void.

The time between the petition and the insolvency declaration by the Court will depend upon a number
of factors, including whether the filing has been made by the debtor or the creditor (and in turn whether the debtor
has challenged the petition made by the creditor), whether all appropriate documentation has been submitted on
a timely basis or it is incomplete, and the workload of the Court.

_Effects on Contracts_

Insolvency declaration does not affect contracts with reciprocal obligations pending performance by both
parties by insolvency declaration (executory contracts), which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations
of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate. Early-termination, suspension or amending
clauses triggered by the declaration of insolvency or the liquidation become void and unenforceable, unless there
exists a legal provision permitting either termination of the contract in the event of insolvency (e.g., RDL 5/2005),
or unilateral termination (e.g., swap agreements or agency agreements).

The debtor or the insolvency trustee, with the Court’s approval, may request the termination of executory
contracts in the interest of the insolvency estate (interés del concurso), including in the absence of contractual
grounds for termination. A hearing with the parties will be held at which they will have the opportunity to reach
an agreement on the termination and its effects. If an agreement is not reached, formal court proceedings will be
held that will result in a decision issued by the Court. The indemnity granted to the contractual counterparty as a
result of a contract being terminated early will be an insolvency claim (crédito concursal), and no longer a claim
against the estate (crédito contra la masa).

As a general rule, it is not possible to terminate an executory contract for breaches that occurred before
the declaration of the insolvency proceedings. However, if a material breach of the executory contract occurred

438


-----

after the declaration of insolvency, the non-defaulting party may request the termination of the contract by filing
a termination claim with the Court.

As an exception to the above, termination due to pre-existing breaches may be admitted if the executory
contract is a continuing-performance contract (tracto sucesivo). A continuing performance agreement does not
require a one-off performance, but rather successive or continuous performance over an agreed period (for
instance, leases or supply agreements). Some case law and legal scholars take nonetheless the position that
termination of the contract should not be possible if one party already complied with its contractual obligations
prior to the declaration of insolvency.

When the default took place before the declaration of insolvency (when allowed), the claims of the nondefaulting party (including indemnity claims) will be an insolvency claim (crédito concursal). On the contrary,
claims arising from defaults which took place after the declaration of insolvency will be claims against the estate
(crédito contra la masa). Termination of the contract will also extinguish the outstanding contractual obligations.

The Court may disregard the breach – regardless of whether it occurred before or after the declaration of
insolvency –, and order specific performance of the contract for the remaining contractual term, if the continuation
of the agreement is deemed to be beneficial for the outcome of the insolvency proceedings. The Court order may
be appealed. If the default took place after the declaration of insolvency, the amounts owed to non-defaulting
parties arising from the agreement must be paid from the debtor’s insolvency estate within three months after the
Court order. If such payment is breach, the continuation of the contract will lose its effect.

To ensure that the debtor’s insolvency estate has sufficient financial resources to continue the business,
the Spanish Insolvency Law allows the insolvency administrator, either unilaterally or at the debtor’s request, to
reinstate (rehabilitación) credit and other facility agreements to which the debtor was a party and which were
accelerated by the creditor as a result of a payment default (principal or interest) in the three months preceding
the declaration of insolvency. The exercise of this power by the insolvency administrator is subject to three
conditions:

- the insolvency administrator must provide notice of the reinstatement to the creditor before expiry of the
term to lodge claims (that is, as a general rule, one month as from publication of the declaration of
insolvency);

- the insolvency administrator must satisfy or deposit any amounts unpaid at the time of reinstatement and
“assume” future payments against the insolvency estate; and

- the creditor must not have started any actions to claim payment before the insolvency proceedings
commenced.

A similar reinstatement rule exists in relation to deferred-payment purchase agreements that are
terminated early within the three months preceding the declaration of insolvency.

Additionally, insolvency declaration suspends interest accrual, except for claims secured with an in rem
right, in which case ordinary interest accrues up to the value of the security, and except for any wage credits in
favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding State Budget Law (Ley de
_Presupuestos del Estado)._

In any event, set-off is prohibited once the debtor has been declared insolvent unless (i) the requirements
for the set-off were satisfied prior to the declaration of insolvency, even if such compensation is alleged
afterwards, or the creditor communicated the existence of the claim to the insolvency administrator; (ii) the claim
of the insolvent debtor is governed by a foreign law that permits set-off; or (iii) the claims and debts arise from
the same legal relation.

As a general rule, insolvency declaration stays, up to a year, enforcement proceedings tied to collateral
necessary to pursue the ordinary course (excluding financial collateral, as defined in RDL 5/2005, which can be
enforced at any time, and where the collateral is located outside of Spain).

The enforcement of any security over certain assets that are necessary to the continuation of the
commercial or professional activity of the insolvent company (in rem securities) is prohibited until the earlier of
(i) an arrangement of a composition agreement being reached, provided that the Composition Agreement does not
affect such right; (ii) one year having elapsed as of the declaration of the insolvency without the opening of the
liquidation phase; or (iii) the judge conducting the insolvency proceedings declaring that the asset is not necessary

439


-----

for the continuation of the debtor’s activities in accordance with the Spanish Insolvency Law. Commencement of
the liquidation phase causes the loss of the right to commence a separate enforcement process in relation to those
secured lenders who did not commence enforcement either before the declaration of insolvency or after a year
since the declaration of insolvency.

Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is
the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that
asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of
the relevant security interest, that has been granted over such shares/quota shares, does not bring about an early
termination or amendment of the contractual relations permitting the economic exploitation of the relevant asset.

_Ranking of Credits_

The judge’s insolvency order contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to them
within one-month period following the last official publication in the Official State Gazette (Boletín Oficial del
_Estado) of the Court order declaring the insolvency (proof of claims), by providing original documentation that_
justifies their claims. Based on such documentation provided by the creditors and held by the debtor, the
insolvency trustee draws up a list of acknowledged claims and classifies them according to the categories
established under law, which are as follows: (i) claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa),
(ii) claims benefiting from special privileges, (iii) claims benefiting from general privileges, (iv) ordinary claims,
and (v) subordinated claims.

###### (a) Claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa) from article 242 of the Spanish Insolvency
Law sets out the so-called “estate claims” which are pre-deductible claims from the estate (excluding
those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security), are generally payable when due according
to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before other claims). Debt against the insolvency estate
includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employees payroll; (ii) costs and expenses of the
insolvency proceedings; (iii) certain amounts deriving from executory contracts and obligations to return
and indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor, those amounts that
derive from the exercise of a claw-back action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by
the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it, if tied to bilateral
contracts (except in cases of bad faith); (iv) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or
from tort liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion;
(v) certain debts in the ordinary course of business incurred by the debtor following the declaration of
insolvency; (vi) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a Composition
Agreement prior to the opening of the liquidation phase; and (vii) 50% of the new funds lent under a
court-sanctioned Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 635 et seq.
of the Spanish Insolvency Law, as long as the claims affected by the approved Plan amount to 51% of
the total liabilities at least (or to more than 60% of the total liabilities, if the new financing is granted by
persons being in a special relationship with the debtor, after deducting the claims of those persons).

###### (b) Claims benefiting from special privileges (créditos con privilegio especial), representing security on
certain assets (essentially in rem security). Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing
security over certain assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided
that such security is listed in the creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the
reasonable value of the secured asset determined in accordance with the rules provided for in the Spanish
Insolvency Law minus senior claims). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be
classified according to the nature of the claim. Claims secured with pledges over future credit rights are
only considered specially privileged if (i) the future credit rights arise from agreements or relationships
established or executed prior to the declaration of insolvency; and (ii) (a) in the case of possessory
pledges, the pledge was granted in a public document before the opening of the insolvency proceedings
or, (b) in the case of non-possessory pledges (prenda sin desplazamiento), the pledge was registered with
the applicable public registry before the opening of the insolvency proceedings.

These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate proceedings, though subject to
certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year from the declaration of the
insolvency and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Law. However, within
such waiting period or while any enforcement proceedings remain suspended under the Spanish
Insolvency Law, the insolvency trustee has the option to pay the relevant claims against the insolvency
estate under specific payment rules. Privileged creditors are not subject to Composition Agreement,

440


-----

unless they give their express support by voting in favor of the Composition Agreement or, in case they
do not give such express support, if creditors holding security which represent at least 60% (or 75%
depending on the conditions of the Composition Agreement) of the total value of secured claims of the
same class vote in favor of such Composition Agreement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to
collect payment against the secured assets on which they are secured.

###### (c) Claims benefiting from general privileges (créditos con privilegio general) include, among others,
certain labor debts and certain debts with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations
corresponding to tax debts and social security obligations and debts held by the creditor applying for the
corresponding insolvency proceedings, to the extent such application has been approved, are recognized
as privileged for up to 50% of the amount of such debts (excluding the claims classified as subordinated).
New funds under a court-sanctioned Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in
articles 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law in the amount not admitted as a debt against the
insolvency estate (crédito contra la masa) will also be credits with general privileges, as long as the
claims affected by the approved Plan amount to 51% of the total liabilities at least (or to more than 60%
of the total liabilities, if the new financing is granted by persons being in a special relationship with the
debtor, after deducting the claims of those persons). The holders of general privileges are not to be
affected by the Composition Agreement except if they give their express support by voting in favor of
the Composition Agreement or, in the case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding
claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the
conditions of the Composition Agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting from general privileges
of the same class vote in favor of such Composition Agreement. If they do not agree to the arrangement
and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment (in the order established by law).

###### (d) Ordinary claims (créditos ordinarios), consisting of non-subordinated and non-privileged claims, will be
paid on a pro-rated basis from the proceeds of the assets not subject to secured claims, former prededuction of estate claims and generally privileged claims.

###### (e) Subordinated claims (créditos subordinados) are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts
subordinated by virtue of law include, among others, some credits held by parties in special relationships
with the debtor (personas especialmente relacionadas). In the case of individuals, this includes their
relatives, legal entities controlled by the debtor or its relatives, the factual or legal administrators of such
legal entities, any other legal entity forming part of the same Group of companies and the legal entities
in respect of which the people described in this paragraph are their factual or legal administrators. In the
case of a legal entity debtor, the following shall be deemed as “specially related parties”: (i) shareholders
with unlimited liability (in case such shareholders are natural persons it would include any specially
related party to these shareholders, as described herein), (ii) limited liability shareholders holding, when
the claim arises, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if
the company has securities listed on an official exchange market)—when the shareholder is an individual,
those who would be specially related to the individual are also specially related to the debtor,
(iii) directors (either de jure or de facto), liquidators and general directors holding general powers of
attorney from the insolvent company (including those people that have held those positions during the
two years prior to the insolvency declaration), and (iv) companies pertaining to the same Group as the
debtor and (v) common shareholders to the insolvent debtor and to other company of the same group,
provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above.
Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights or
were appointed as directors pursuant to a Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth
in articles 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law or to a Composition Agreement shall not be
considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a
result of the financing granted under such Plan or Composition Agreement. Furthermore, in the absence
of evidence to the contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned
in this paragraph are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the
acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open.

Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors: they are not entitled to accede to the Composition
Agreement and in the event of liquidation, they collect payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish
Insolvency Law (once ordinary creditors have been paid in full).

441


-----

**_Hardening Periods_**

There is no automatic “claw-back” by virtue of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that
automatically become void as a result of initiation of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency trustee may only
challenge those transactions that could be deemed as being “detrimental” to the insolvent debtor’s estate, provided
that they have taken place within two years prior to the insolvency filing, even in the absence of fraudulent intent.

The same rescission grounds apply in relation to any detrimental action carried out or agreement entered
into by the debtor within two years preceding the pre-insolvency filing, as well as those carried out since that date
up to the declaration of insolvency, even if there has been no fraudulent intent, as long as: (i) the Plan has not
been passed or, when passed, has not been approved by the Court; and (ii) the insolvency is declared within a year
from the end of the pre-insolvency period.

“Detriment” does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on
the debtor’s interests or on the equality of treatment among creditors. The analysis of whether an action, agreement
or transaction is detrimental to the insolvency estate must be made on a case-by-case basis. The Spanish
Insolvency Law does not define “detrimental” but it establishes a series of presumptions that give some indication
as to how a court would rule in specific cases. Pursuant to the law, (a) detriment exists (as a non-rebuttable
presumption, without admission of proof to the contrary) in the case of (i) disposals without consideration, except
for ordinary largesse (liberalidades de uso) and (ii) early payment of unsecured obligations maturing after the
insolvency declaration (except secured claims); and (b) detriment is deemed to exist (as a rebuttable presumption)
in the case of (i) transactions entered into with parties that have a special relationship with the debtor, (ii) the
creation of in rem rights in order to secure pre-existing obligations or those incurred to replace existing obligations,
and (iii) the cancellation of obligations secured by an in rem security falling due after the declaration of
insolvency. In the remaining cases, detriment would have to be evidenced by the party seeking rescission.

Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other
group companies’ debt may be subject to claw-back, on the basis that such guarantees or security interests may
be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the Spanish Guarantor is not able to show that there was
a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the Spanish Guarantor to grant such guarantee or security (beyond
an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same Group of companies or the so-called
“group interest”). Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee or security by the Spanish Guarantor is
detrimental to the guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case-by-case basis (the
beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Recent Spanish rulings which do not constitute
settled case law indicate, and certain scholars, understand that risk associated with a guarantee or the value of a
security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee or secure indebtedness held by other companies
within its corporate group must be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Spanish
company’s perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Spanish case law recognizes the validity of upstream guarantees.

If a claw-back action is successful, restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction, together
with the proceeds and interest, will be ordered by the judge. If the assets cannot be restored to the debtor, the
counterparty to the insolvent debtor must pay an amount in cash equal to the value of the assets at the time of their
disposal, plus interest. If the judge rules that the transaction has been conducted in bad faith, the liable party will
be obligated to indemnify the debtor for loss and damages suffered as its claim will be classified as subordinated.
If the judge does not conclude that the transaction was conducted in bad faith, the counterparty to the debtor will
settle its credit simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and rights to the insolvency estate as per bilateral
contracts.

The exercise of claw-back actions does not prevent other actions against the debtor in accordance with
law, which may be brought before the insolvency judge.

Under no circumstances can the following be rescinded: (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the
debtor’s ordinary course of the business, provided that they are carried out under market conditions, (ii) actions
contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or liquidation of values and
derivative instruments, (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of public law creditors or credits in favor of the labor
authorities, and (iv) transactions subject to foreign law in case the beneficiary of the transaction can prove that
such transaction cannot be rescinded under the law to which it is subject to. The amended Spanish Insolvency
Law has also included among the transactions that cannot be subject to claw-back any transactions acknowledging
and paying public law credits to mitigate the debtor’s liability pursuant to the applicable criminal laws.

442


-----

Neither Plans nor any transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any guarantees instituted in the
performance of such Plans will be subject to claw-back actions, provided that they comply with the requirements
set out below in section “Protection of Certain Plans Against Claw-back”.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_**

Under Spanish law, in addition to the insolvency claw-back action, the insolvency trustee and any
creditor may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria pauliana) against its debtor and
the third party which is a party to such contract or agreement, provided that the same is performed or entered into
fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed in any other way. Although case law is
not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor
to bring such action:

- the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after
such debt was created;

- the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party;

- such act was fraudulent;

- there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered;
and

- debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s
estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements
under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed (as opposed to claw-back actions where the subjective
component or fraud does not have to be proven). Pursuant to article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code (i) agreements
by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out
by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a
writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in
(i) above is a juris et de jure presumption (cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in
(ii) above, which is a juris tantum presumption (a rebuttable presumption).

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return the consideration
received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would
need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by
the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for
such damages.

**_Protection of Certain Plans Against Claw-back_**

Certain Plans may be protected from claw-back risk provided that they comply with certain requirements.

In order to seek protection against claw-back, Plans can be judicially sanctioned (homologado) by the
Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil) that will be competent to conduct a potential insolvency proceeding,
upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such Plan.

If the Plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the debtor’s total liabilities, the following will not
be subject to claw-back unless it is proven that they were made with an intent to defraud creditors:

###### (a) actions and transactions that were “reasonable” and “immediately necessary” for the successful
negotiation of the Plan, if expressly identified as such in the Plan.

Any payment of (i) fees or costs in relation to negotiating, signing or confirming the Plan; (ii)
fees for legal and professional advice with close relationship with the restructuring;
(iii) employee salaries for completed work; and (iv) other amounts in the ordinary course of the
debtor’s business activity, will be deemed to be protected actions and transactions;

###### (b) interim and new money:

443


-----

1. Interim money: new financing granted to the debtor that is reasonable and immediately
needed to (i) ensure that the debtor’s activity continues totally or partially while the
Plan is being negotiated (and until a Court approves it); or (ii) maintain or increase the
value of the debtor’s business or business units.

2. New money: new financing granted to the debtor that is provided for in the Plan and is
necessary for its implementation.

Interim and new money may benefit from two effects:

###### 1. Protection against claw-back under the same terms as any other actions or transactions
resulting from the Plan. As a special rule, in order to protect interim or new money lent
by a “specially related party” to the debtor from claw-back, the claims affected by the
Plan (after deducting any claims held by specially related parties) must represent more
than 60% of the debtor’s liabilities. Otherwise, they will be subject to the ordinary
claw-back regime.

###### 2. Preferential treatment for repayment of interim or new money: in the event of the
debtor’s insolvency, 50% of the interim or new money provided in the framework of a
court-approved Plan will be treated as a claim against the estate (crédito contra la
_masa). The remaining 50% will be treated as a generally privileged claim (crédito con_
_privilegio general)._

This preferential treatment will only apply if the claims affected by the Plan exceed
the minimum thresholds described above with respect to the debtor’s total liabilities
(i.e., 51% in general, and 60% (after deducting any claims held by specially related
parties) if interim or new money is granted by a “specially related party” to the debtor).

###### (c) actions and transactions that are reasonable and immediately necessary to implement the Plan.

If the Plan affects claims that represent less than 51% of the debtor’s total liabilities, the actions and
transactions described above may still be subject to claw-back, but none of the rebuttable presumptions of
detriment explained in section “Hardening Periods” will apply. Therefore (as long as none of the non-rebuttable
presumptions apply), the insolvency administrator or the creditor requesting the claw-back will need to evidence
the detriment.

Court approval of a Plan may be sought merely to ring-fence it from potential claw-back if the debtor
becomes insolvent (i.e., without seeking to cram down dissenting creditors). The Court will verify that the relevant
majorities required for court approval are met prior to approving the Plan.

Judicially sanctioned Plans will not be subject to the insolvency claw-back action, but they may be
challenged pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law.

As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an
interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the Plan if it is favorably voted upon by at least
75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan
agreement. In any case, if the relevant threshold is satisfied, the plan will be deemed approved by the total amount
of the creditors subject to the syndicated instrument. If the threshold is not satisfied, votes of consenting creditors
will be taken into account on an individual basis, unless the syndicated claims constitute a single class of creditors
(in which case it will be deemed that that class has not approved the Plan). In addition, dissenting creditors under
a syndicated instrument can challenge the restructuring plan before the Courts.

A Plan can be approved either by all classes of creditors (if certain majorities are reached within each
class (consensual plans) or not by all classes of creditors (non-consensual plans or cross-class cram-down). For
the latter to happen, the Plan must meet one of the following two requirements: (a) it must be supported by a
simple majority of the classes, provided at least one of those classes is composed of claims that would benefit
from a general or special privilege (i.e., secured claims) if the debtor were declared insolvent; or, failing that, (b)
it must be supported by at least one of the classes that is “in the money” (i.e., any class that could, upon a valuation
of the debtor as a going concern by the restructuring expert, be reasonably presumed to receive any payment
according to the ranking of liquidation priorities applicable under the Spanish Insolvency Law). The Plan can only
be imposed on the shareholders if the company is in a situation of imminent or current insolvency.

444


-----

Following the above, a dissenting creditor belonging to a dissenting class subject to a haircut will be
allowed to challenge the Plan based on, among others, a more junior class (or the equity holders) receiving any
payment from –or maintaining any interest in– the debtor under the Plan (i.e., the absolute-priority rule). The
Spanish Insolvency Law, however, contains certain exceptions to the absolute-priority rule (it can be derogated
in order to ensure the viability of the company and that the affected creditors’ claims would not be unjustifiably
prejudiced).

The effects of a cross-class cram-down are subject to some practical limitations. If the Plan affects a class
of claims secured by rights in rem, and that class has rejected the Plan by a majority of dissenting votes over
favorable votes, any secured dissenting creditor of that class will have the right to:

###### (a) enforce the underlying security interest (which will accelerate the underlying secured claim)
within a month of the Court ruling approving the Plan being published in the Public Insolvency
Register (Registro Público Concusal). If the proceeds obtained from the enforcement are

(i) lower than the security value of the collateral set out in the Plan, the creditor will keep
those proceeds in full (security value = 90% of “reasonable value” – legally preferred
claims). Any deficit will remain unsatisfied; or

(ii) higher than the security value collateral set out in the Plan, but lower than the original
claim, the creditor will keep those proceeds in full. Any excess will be deducted from the
amounts that the creditor’s unsecured part of the claim would be entitled to receive
pursuant to the Plan; or

###### (b) only if expressly provided in the Plan, wait to receive a cash payment for the amount of the
secured claim that is covered by the security value of the collateral within no more than 120
days. If payment is not received in a timely manner, the affected creditor will be entitled to
enforce the security interest.

**_Liquidation_**

Failure to obtain the approval of a creditors’ arrangement plan (or upon debtor’s petition at any time)
leads to liquidation. The debtor must file for liquidation after a creditors arrangement proposal has been approved
when it becomes aware of its renovated insolvency situation or its inability to comply with the Plan. Liquidation
triggers company dissolution and the insolvency administrator stepping into the directors’ shoes. Liquidation is
moreover an acceleration and cash conversion event.

Spanish Insolvency Law contains certain general rules of liquidation to be followed by the insolvency
trustee, which can be modified or replaced by the judge on a case-by-case basis, subject to a hearing of or report
from the trustee (to be issued within 10 calendar days) (special rules).The insolvency administrator is required to
report quarterly on the liquidation and has one year to complete it. If the liquidation is not completed within one
year, the Court may appoint a different insolvency administrator.

_Termination of the insolvency proceedings_

Section 5º of article 465 of the Spanish Insolvency Law also foresees the termination of the insolvency
proceeding at any stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid, or that all creditors have been entirely
satisfied by other means.

Finally, it must be noted that section 7º of article 465 and article 473 of the Spanish Insolvency Law
foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at any time when assets are not enough to pay post
insolvency debt, so long as no future claw-back actions are envisaged, nor actions claiming liability to third
parties, nor the assessment of the proceeding as guilty.

**_Applicable Jurisdiction_**

Pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of May 20,
on insolvency proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”), the Court that has jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company is the Court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company
concerned has its “centre of main interest” as the term is used in section 1 of article 3 of the Insolvency Regulation.
Where a company conducts business in more than one Member State of the European Union, the jurisdiction of
the relevant Courts may be limited if the company’s centre of main interest is found to be in a Member State other

445


-----

than its place of incorporation. The centre of main interest is presumed to be at the registered domicile of the
company, but this presumption can be rebutted by a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the
centre of main interest, which should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of
its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The point at which this issue will be
determined is at the time when the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened (for these purposes, under Spanish
law, if the place of incorporation of the debtor has changed during the six months prior to the insolvency
declaration, such change shall not be taken into account). The determination of where the issuer or any of the
guarantors has its “centre of main interests” would be a question of fact on which the courts of the different
European Union Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. It should also be noted that a
limited number of final decisions have been taken in cases that have been brought before the European Court of
Justice in relation to questions of interpretation or the effects of the Insolvency Regulation throughout the
European Union. Furthermore, “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to
time.

In the event Spanish Courts have jurisdiction, article 261 of the current Spanish Insolvency Law may
apply, in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by a Spanish Guarantor may be
classified as “contingent” claims and no amount may be recognized until and when a default occurs and the
guarantee is validly enforced. Nor will they have voting rights. Special rules can apply if the guarantee is not a
first demand guarantee but an ordinary guarantee (fianza) and, therefore, the benefits of preference (excusión),
order (orden) and division (división) apply.

**_Set-off_**

Spanish Insolvency Law generally prohibits set-off of the credits and debts of the insolvent company
once it has been declared insolvent, but such set-off whose requirements in order to operate were met before the
declaration of insolvency can still apply. However, set-off may be exercised by a determined creditor vis-à-vis
the insolvent company if the governing law of the reciprocal credit right of the insolvent company permits it under
insolvency scenarios.

**_Spanish security interests_**

Spanish law is based, inter alia, on the principle of specialty (principio de especialidad), by virtue of
which a security interest can secure only one main obligation and its ancillary obligations, such as interest, costs,
etc. As a general principle, where two different main obligations are to be secured, two different security interests
must be created. Spanish Civil Code does not expressly regulate the possibility of creating second or subsequent
ranking pledges with delivery of possession. However, Law 41/2007, of December 7, which modifies Law 2/1981,
of March 25, on Regulation of the Mortgage Market and other regulations of the mortgage and financial system,
regulation of reverse mortgages and insurance of dependence and by which a certain tax rule is established (Ley
_41/2007, de 7 de diciembre, por la que se modifica la Ley 2/1981, de 25 de marzo, de Regulación del Mercado_
_Hipotecario y otras normas del sistema hipotecario y financiero, de regulación de las hipotecas inversas y el_
_seguro de dependencia y por la que se establece determinada norma tributaria) recognises, with respect to the_
creation of pledges without delivery of possession and with the creation of chattel mortgages, the possibility of
creating pledges without delivery of possession and chattel mortgages with a concurrent and/or second or
subsequent rank with regards to an already existing first ranking pledge without delivery of possession or to a first
ranking chattel mortgage. As a consequence of the above, there are also grounds to sustain the validity of second
ranking pledges, even though a different view from the competent Courts cannot be disregarded.

Separately, Spanish Civil Code does not expressly regulate the possibility of creating a single global
pledge to secure several obligations. However, this is contemplated in RDL 5/2005 and in some resolutions from
the Directorate-General of Registers and Notaries (Dirección General de los Registros y del _Notariado), which_
allows the creation of single financial security to secure several obligations and global real estate mortgages,
regulated by article 153 bis of Spanish mortgage law dated 8 February 1946 (Decreto de 8 de febrero de 1946,
_por el que se aprueba la nueva redacción oficial de la Ley Hipotecaria), which also allows to secure several_
obligations in a single mortgage. As a consequence of the above, there are also grounds to sustain the validity of
global pledges, even though a different view from the competent Courts cannot be disregarded.

Given the above any security governed by Spanish common law (Derecho Común) may be created to
secure various obligations (either one security per obligation or as a global security) but to the extent it is not
expressly foreseen neither tested by the Spanish Courts, a Court ruling may come to the conclusion any such
security to be void and null.

446


-----

Likewise Spanish law is based, inter alia, on the principle of ancillary nature (principio de accesoriedad),
by virtue of which a security interest, in general terms, under Spanish law, any pledge must secure another
obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant security agreement. Therefore,
the guarantee or security interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying
obligation entails nullity of the guarantee or security interest and termination of the underlying obligation entails
termination of the guarantee or security interest.

In the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid
guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish Courts may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s
obligations under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not enforceable. In addition, a guarantee or
security interest may not be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as
applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by
any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations.

According to Spanish law, the law governing in rem legal aspects of a pledge is the law applicable in the
place of location of the pledged asset (lex rei sitae). When the pledged asset is a credit right—such as receivables
or intercompany loans—the determination of the lex rei sitae is unclear given its lack of physical existence. In
these cases, several theories have been construed amongst Spanish scholars so as to determine the lex rei sitae
(such as domicile of debtor of the credit rights being pledged, domicile of pledgor, law governing the credit right
being pledged, etc.). If a Judge considered that any of the pledges created over credit rights under the Spanish
security documents is governed by the Law 5/2006, of May 10, of the Fifth Book on the Catalonian Civil Code,
on in rem rights (Ley 5/2006, de 10 de mayo, del libro quinto del Código Civil de Cataluña, relativo a los derechos
_reales), then this regulation would govern those pledges instead of the Spanish civil common law, which could_
determine the challenge of the validity of such pledges.

A Spanish Court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default
were of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish Courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration,
a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot
be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code.

**England and Wales**

One of the Guarantors is a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (an “English
**company”). As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to an English company should be commenced**
in England based on English insolvency laws; although insolvency proceedings in respect of English companies
could also be based in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances.

**_Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts_**

While the UK was a member state of the EU, insolvency processes opened in the UK were subject to
both EU and applicable UK domestic legislation. Following the UK’s departure from the EU on 31 January 2020
and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on 31 December 2020, in accordance
with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement)
Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the UK at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain
exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant amendments. The Insolvency
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) effected key amendments to both EU
insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the UK, including the EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on
Insolvency Proceedings (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), and domestic insolvency laws, including the
Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024)
(the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border
**Insolvency Regulations”).**

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the
Transition Period, in which case the unmodified Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency
legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to an English company would likely
proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant
proceedings. However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”) in a
member state of the EU, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject
to certain exceptions, in addition be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU
member state. In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign insolvency
processes may be recognized by the English court in respect of the insolvency proceedings of any English

447


-----

company that has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory
economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Although the scope of
the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales,
English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has
its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment”
in the UK. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has
carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory
economic activity with human means and assets. While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over
certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings may
depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions
(see “—Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings”).

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible
to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes are
guaranteed by the Guarantees and secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and
other limitations could limit the enforceability of the payment obligations of the Issuer in respect of the principal,
interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer and of a Guarantee against an English Obligor and of the security
interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such
limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights
for payment of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer and/or under the Guarantee and/or
under the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors
may receive in an insolvency of an English Obligor.

**_Fixed versus floating charges_**

The Notes and the Guarantees will benefit from fixed and floating charge security over certain Collateral
owned by certain of the English Obligors.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security.

Until floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to
floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed
of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge.

On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating
charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating
charge has not crystallised at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation
of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the
remuneration of insolvency office-holders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging
company while in administration) properly incurred in an insolvency process are generally payable out of the
assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge)
and insolvency office-holders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use
such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the
extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses
in full; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without
the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in
respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) where the floating charge
is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or
financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under
the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral
**Regulations”), assets subject to floating charge security are subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors**
and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors (see “—Priority on insolvency”); and (e) there
are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to floating charge security (see “—Voidable floating
_charge”)._

There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that fixed security interests expressed to be created
by a security document governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given
to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as

448


-----

fixed security interests rather than recharacterised as floating security interests will depend, among other things,
on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s ability to deal with
the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in
practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed
charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security
interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Administration_**

The Insolvency Act empowers English courts to make an administration order in respect of any company
incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or an EEA State, any company (irrespective of its country of
incorporation) with its COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other than Denmark) and upon request from
courts in other parts of the UK or certain other countries and territories. Without limitation and subject to specific
conditions, such an order may be applied for by the company itself, a majority of its directors, one or more of its
creditors (including contingent or prospective creditors) or certain other designated persons. In each case and
subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant
company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely
to achieve the purpose of administration.

Under section 123 of the Insolvency Act, the circumstances in which a company is deemed “unable to
pay its debts” include, among others, the following: (a) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum
exceeding £750 then due has served a statutory demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so
due and the company has failed for three weeks to pay, secure or compound the sum to the reasonable satisfaction
of the creditor; (b) failure to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order); (c) if it is proved to
the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (d) if it is proved to the
satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into
account its contingent and prospective liabilities. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that
must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable,
achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation
or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not
unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential
creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on
_insolvency”)._

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a
qualifying floating charge (see “—Qualifying floating charge” below), and different procedures apply according
to the identity of the person making the appointment.

During the administration, in general, no resolution may be passed, and no order may be made, for the
winding up of the debtor and no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the
debtor, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with permission of the court or the consent of
the administrator.

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are
appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in
administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization
of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential
creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “—Prescribed Part”). An administrator may also, with
prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is
likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal
towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder.

Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s
property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the administration
moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

It is likely, to the extent that it is not a financial collateral arrangement, that the security granted by an
English company may not be enforced while it is in administration.

449


-----

**_Qualifying floating charge_**

If a company grants security constituting a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of
English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator out of court (see “—Administration”)
or (in limited circumstances) an administrative receiver (see “—Administrative Receivership”). The holder of a
qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to appoint
an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable,
administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors
over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the
company going into administration.

A floating charge constitutes a qualifying floating charge if it is created by an instrument which (a) states
that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator
of the company, or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning
given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such
floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security granted to that party, relates to the
whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company, and at least one such security interest
is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted
relates to “the whole or substantially the whole” of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance
as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

**_Administrative receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in very
limited circumstances. The ability to appoint an administrative receiver only applies to holders of a qualifying
floating charge where either the security document granting such charge pre-dates 15 September 2003 or where
it falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002). The most
relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to
“capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes
creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the English company under the arrangement and the arrangement
involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and is generally a
rated, listed or traded debt instrument).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court
(and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure)
and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the
security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an
undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge (see “—Transactions at an undervalue”, “—Preference”
and “—Voidable floating charge,” respectively). If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will
vacate office.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating
charges – see “—Administrative receivership”) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed
charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances)
pursuant to statute under the Law of Property Act 1925, although it is standard market practice to augment the
powers of any receiver appointed through the relevant security document.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the
charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for
an appointment to take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such and a
fixed charge receivership can be run in parallel to a liquidation or an administration. However, an administrator
may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge
created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial
Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration”).

The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning
(s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor, although certain limited duties are also owed to the
chargor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a
company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a

450


-----

collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the
best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory
indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have
the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be
deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential
creditors (see “—Prescribed Part”).

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities
between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). An English Obligor may be able to propose a
scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign Obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under
the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also propose a scheme. In
practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be
satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are
English law governed or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to
be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so
previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied
in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that
such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If
a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s)
of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds
contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all
affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted
against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court
will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether
to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to
sanction the scheme. In exercising its discretion to sanction a scheme of a foreign Obligor, the court will need to
be satisfied that the scheme of arrangement would have substantial effect in the jurisdictions in which the company
has its main assets or operations, in the jurisdictions of any other obligors of the debt and under the governing law
the affected debt documents (if not English law). This is typically achieved by providing expert evidence that the
scheme of arrangement (or its effect) is likely to be recognized in such jurisdictions. Once sanctioned, the scheme
of arrangement binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the scheme of arrangement, which
shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the scheme of
arrangement to the Registrar of Companies.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not
automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Restructuring plan_**

Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006, namely
Part 26A thereof, which allows the English courts to effect a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a
company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors), but with the added possibility of a ‘cross-class cramdown’. While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a
company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to
encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going
concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any
class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial
difficulties.

A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any
liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will
vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of

451


-----

classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and
any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and
voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed compromise. There is no
requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting,
and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of the plan, provided that the
court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the restructuring
plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ and (b) the restructuring
plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic
interest in the company in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes of this
assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the
restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for
the possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or
more classes of affected creditors do not vote in favour of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of
one class of stakeholders to bind other classes.

Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory
conditions have been met and may also consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court
has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan
binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan.

In the case of a non-UK company that is not required to register particulars with the Registrar of
Companies (namely those without a UK physical presence, like an establishment, branch or place of business,
where it carries on business), a restructuring plan will become effective when a copy of the order has been
published in the Gazette.

For all other companies, including an English company, a restructuring plan will become effective upon
delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies.

As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not
automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Liquidation/winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see
“—Priority on insolvency”). There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court;
and (b) voluntary liquidation, either in the form of (I) members’ voluntary liquidation or (ii) creditors’ voluntary
liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members.

A members’ voluntary liquidation is a solvent liquidation that is initiated by the shareholders. It
commences when the shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no
involvement by the court.

Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the directors must swear a
statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after making full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have
formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts in full (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act –
see “—Administration”), including interest and the costs of the members’ voluntary liquidation process, within a
stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation.

A creditors’ voluntary liquidation is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company
into liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to an members’ voluntary liquidation, however, the
directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (meaning the
company can be solvent or insolvent). The directors must seek a decision of the creditors to nominate a liquidator.
If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will
prevail, unless the court determines otherwise.

Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign
companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction

452


-----

(see “—Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts”), members’ voluntary liquidation
proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant
company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void.
However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise
arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent
a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an
order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the
presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings
against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the
company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no
freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no
equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary windingup – it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the
continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security.

Regardless of how (s)he is appointed, a liquidator has a general duty to act in good faith and to exercise
their powers with reasonable skill and care for their proper purpose, and to act impartially to avoid conflicts of
interest. A liquidator’s powers include to: (i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the
company’s property; (iii) bring or defend any legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous
property or contracts; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring actions to set aside
certain transactions (see “—Avoidance of transactions”).

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and/or guarantees, or the entry by an English company into a transaction can be challenged. In most cases,
this will only arise if the English company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period
after the relevant act. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an
English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by
such company, or certain transactions entered into by the company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event
that the onset of an English company’s insolvency is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the
grant of a security interest or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would
uphold the transaction as valid.

_Onset of insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and
invalid floating charges (all discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued or (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court or (c)
otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to
court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where
liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration.

_Connected persons_

If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of
transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges is a party who is (i) a director of the
company, (ii) a shadow director, (iii) an associate of such director or shadow director, or (iv) an associate of the
relevant company.

453


-----

A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (iv) the husband,
wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual, or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the
individual’s husband, wife or civil partner.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company.

A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a
person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have
control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist
of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a
member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is able to be taken as having
control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of
them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions or he is entitled to exercise, or control
the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another
company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are
to be taken as having control of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest
or guarantee granted by the English Obligor include, without limitation, the following.

_Transaction at an undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set
aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if such liquidator or administrator
believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A
transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the
transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123
of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if onset of the company’s insolvency occurs within a
period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. In any
proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts
unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as set out above), in which case there is a presumption
of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the English company in such proceedings.

A transaction is “at an undervalue” if the transaction is a gift or a transaction on terms that provide for
the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or
money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by
the company.

A court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and
for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the
transaction would benefit it.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such
order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the
transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An
order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any
person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order
will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith
and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received
a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the
company, except where the person was a party to the transaction.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set
aside payments, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believed that
the creation of such payment, security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference.

A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the
transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts at the relevant time or becomes unable to pay its debts (as
defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the company’s

454


-----

insolvency occurs within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a
connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a
connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the English company grants
the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a
creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position
(in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would
otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. However, for the court to determine a
preference, it must be shown that the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential
position in relation to that person when taking their decision.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable
to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the
beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by
reason only of being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a
better position in which case the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no in fact
such desire, on the part of the company, to prefer them.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit
to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may
include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a
preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person
to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired
from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an
interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to
pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a
preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company.

_Transaction defrauding creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue (i.e. that
the transaction is a gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a
transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value
(in money or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company) and the court is satisfied that it was
made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a
claim against the company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that
person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors.
This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction including the UK
Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the
leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and use of the provision is therefore not
limited to liquidators or administrators.

There is no statutory time limit within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does
not need to be insolvent at the time of or as a result of the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make
such order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered
into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under
the Notes or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or
impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not they are the person with whom the transaction was entered
into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other
than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not
require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the
relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was
a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate credit transaction_

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A
transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of
it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain
contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of

455


-----

fair dealing. It is presumed, unless otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with
respect to which an administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside an extortionate credit transaction
in extortionate. The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by a
company up to three years before the day on which a company entered administration or liquidation. That order
may set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations
of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the
transaction, The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums
already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the
transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests
in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g. assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided
credit under it).

_Voidable floating charges_

Under English insolvency law, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year prior
to the onset of the company’s insolvency (or two years in case of a floating charge in favour of a connected person)
at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts (or became unable to do so as a result of) granting the
floating charge, will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of (i) the money paid to, or (ii) the goods or
services supplied to, or (iii) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the English company at the same time as
or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for a
company to be insolvent at the time of granting the floating charge or to become insolvent as a consequence of
doing so does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person.

However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the
Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that
a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is
automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration, whether the relevant company is
solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.

**_Limitation on enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or security by any of the English companies in respect of the obligations of
another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be
allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do
not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found
to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if
they are dealing with an English company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties
in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question by virtue
of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must
act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English company
for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient
commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be
vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

One of the primary functions of administration and liquidation under English law is to realize the assets
of the insolvent company and to distribute realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the
Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the
realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the
exception of the “Prescribed Part” (see “—Prescribed part”), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of
creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have
agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed
in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Insolvency set-off applies automatically as a matter of statute and cannot be contracted out of. It arises
where, prior to specified points in the company’s liquidation or administration, there have been “mutual dealings”
between the company and a creditor. The application of insolvency set-off requires that account be taken of the
sums due to the company from the creditor and vice versa in the course of those mutual dealings to be set off, so
that only the balance may be claimed by the liquidator or administrator or proved for by the creditor. In the case
of liquidation, insolvency set-off applies from the date the liquidation commences. In the case of administration,

456


-----

insolvency set-off applies if, and from the point that, the administrator gives notice that they propose to make a
distribution to creditors. The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

_First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured_
assets covers that indebtedness).

_Second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the_
order of priority in which expenses are paid).

_Third ranking claims: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

        - Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent
company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and
salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum
of £800 per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated,
whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date. As between one another,
preferential debts rank equally.

        - Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential
debts and include claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax,
employee NI contributions, student loan repayments and Construction Industry Scheme deductions
(but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on
behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank
equally.

_Fourth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security._
This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but
which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset
realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must be set aside for
distribution to unsecured creditors (see “—Prescribed part”).

_Fifth ranking claims:_

        - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (which, for these purposes, would include
a creditor’s unsecured claim to any shortfall in its secured claim) (not repaid in full from the
realization of assets subject to its security), in each case including accrued and unpaid interest
on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay
a shortfall, the officeholder can only use realization from unsecured assets, as secured creditors
are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part in respect of a shortfall unless the
Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to
surrender its security.

        - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual
rate and the rate determined in accordance with Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum))
in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of
an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the
case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantees, such interest due
to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be
discharged out of such security recoveries; and

        - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the
categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories
above are fully repaid.

_Sixth ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining_
funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

457


-----

**_Prescribed part_**

An insolvency officeholder of a company (e.g. an administrator, receiver (including administrative
receiver) or liquidator) will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of
floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this
applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of the company’s net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the
company’s net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s
net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before 6 April
2020, in which the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured
creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. As noted
above, the Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors.

The requirement of the insolvency office-holder to set aside a Prescribed Part will not apply to any charge
created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**_Foreign currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claims for their
debts, any debt of a company payable in a currency other than pound sterling must be converted into pound sterling
at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing at
the relevant date. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to
be unreasonable, it may apply to the court.

**_Recharacterisation of fixed charges_**

As referred to above (see “—Fixed versus floating charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being
recharacterised as a floating charge. If purported fixed security that is subsequently recharacterised has been
granted within the suspect period referred to above (see “—Voidable floating charges”), this could render the
charge invalid except to the value of the Consideration.

**_Security over shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English Obligor or over shares of an English Obligor are, under
English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a charging company creates
an encumbrance over the property in favour of the chargee but the charging company retains legal title to the
shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be
at the discretion of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares
may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances)
the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under
English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities

**_Security over bank accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by an English
Obligor, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may have reserved
their right at any time to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling
or other arrangements with that English Obligor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is
merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to
the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under
the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed charge (as it
would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English Obligor)
and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant
Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such
circumstances.

**_Limitations on enforcement_**

458


-----

_Constitutional documents, corporate benefit and financial assistance_

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by any of the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of
another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. Among other requirements, such a transaction
must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these
documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security
can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for
third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not
without difficulties in its interpretation.

Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its
entry into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a
way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit
of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial
benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to
being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain
circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the
statutory provisions do not prescribe when this shift arises, the English courts have held that it takes place when
the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely”
in this context meaning “probable.”

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to
the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

_Security registration_

Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document
pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security
governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be
delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant
security interest (the “Registration Period”). While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as
such on English companies to register security, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator,
administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the Registration Period.
When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become
immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to
rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the Registration Period has expired.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration
with the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales
similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable
asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

_Moratoriums_

As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the
automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are
unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security
or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “—
_Administration”), moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “—Liquidation/winding-_
_up”), and a standalone moratorium for companies in financial distress._

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 includes a new standalone moratorium for
companies in financial distress into a new Part A1 of Insolvency Act. The directors of a company with a sufficient
connection to England and Wales to be eligible for compulsory liquidation (as described above) may apply for
the moratorium without first invoking a formal insolvency proceeding if they are of the view that the company is
or is likely to become unable to pay its debts, subject to certain exceptions and other eligibility criteria. A
moratorium will initially last for 20 business days (extendable without court or creditor consent by a further 20
business days and by up to a year in total with creditor consent), giving a debtor breathing space from creditor
action to enable it to pursue restructuring options.

During the moratorium the company is protected from the following forms of creditor action: (a) the
enforcement of security (except where security constitutes a “security financial collateral arrangement”); (b) the

459


-----

crystallisation of any floating charges or imposition of any restrictions on the disposal of an asset subject to a
floating charge; and (c) the commencement of insolvency processes (e.g. administration or liquidation) in respect
of the company. As well as the protections from creditor action outlined above, the company is relieved from
paying any debts that have fallen due prior to the commencement of the moratorium or that fall due during the
moratorium but were incurred prior to the moratorium, subject to a number of exclusions. One such notable
exclusion from the payment holiday applies to contractual debts or liabilities relating to financial services
contracts, which generally includes loan facilities and capital markets transactions.

While secured creditors are prevented from enforcing their security (unless it qualifies as a “security
financial collateral arrangement”), they are entitled to call a default, accelerate their debt or demand repayment of
amounts owed and terminate contracts during the moratorium. If payments cannot be made as and when they fall
due, in respect of such debts to which the payment holiday does not apply, an independent monitor (appointed by
the court to oversee the moratorium) will be required to bring the moratorium to an end, likely triggering the entry
into a formal insolvency process (e.g. liquidation or administration).

_Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_

Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto
clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing
insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts
which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic
termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an
insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into
a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary
arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be
unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant office-holder consents to the
termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract
would cause the supplier hardship.

The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in
the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees,
contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of,
arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act)[.]

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed
by applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and
judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable
in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency
(the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great
Britain, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law, among other
things, facilitates the recognition in an implementing jurisdiction of insolvency proceedings instituted in another
jurisdiction as either foreign main proceedings (if the insolvency proceedings are in the place of the COMI of the
relevant debtor) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the insolvency proceedings are not in the place of the debtor’s
COMI but the debtor has an establishment there) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The
nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the
domestic law of the jurisdiction in question.

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement and
restructuring plans will be a question for the domestic law of any recognising state and private international law
and treaties - for example, Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17
June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”) (for recognition within the EU only) or
any treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of
civil judgments (such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague
**Convention”)).**

460


-----

It will depend on whether the recognising state treats restructuring plans in the same way as schemes of
arrangement for the purposes of recognition or whether it treats them more akin to insolvency proceedings (which
might, for example, mean they fall within exceptions to any particular treaties or within the scope of domestic law
for the recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings).

_Recognition in the EU_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no
longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation
terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic
recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters,
cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of
uncertainty and increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic
for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders
to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and
recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the
need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in
cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than
COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. To the
extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law (e.g., schemes of arrangement or
restructuring plans), Rome I may offer a basis for recognition in EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU
member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member
state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized
and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.

**Australia**

One of the Guarantors, Lima Australia, is incorporated under the laws of Australia. In Australia, there
are general limitations on the validity and the enforceability of the Guarantee to be taken into consideration.
Further, in the event of an insolvency of the Lima Australia, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Australia
and Australian insolvency law would govern those proceedings.

**_Insolvency processes_**

There are four principal corporate insolvency processes in Australia: administration (sometimes referred
to as voluntary administration); deed of company arrangement (which is one possible outcome of voluntary
administration); liquidation (also referred to as winding up); and receivership. There is also a fifth less common
regime pursuant to a scheme of arrangement. Each of these are statutory processes under the Australian
Corporations Act. A brief description of each of these processes is set out below.

_Administration_

According to s 435A of the Australian Corporations Act, the object of administration is to provide for
the business, property and affairs of a company that is, or is likely to become, insolvent at some future time to be
administered in a way that maximizes the chances of the company, or as much as possible of its business,
continuing in existence, or if it is not possible for the company or its business to continue in existence, is to result
in a better return for the company’s creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding up of
the company. During the administration period there is a general moratorium on the enforcement of creditors’
claims (subject to certain exceptions) and also a stay on legal proceedings which will prevent, amongst other
things, security being enforced (subject to certain exceptions). The administration period therefore enables the
administrator to continue to trade the company’s business, and for any proposal to rehabilitate the company or
otherwise maximize returns to creditors (other than via an immediate winding up) to be put before creditors, and,
if approved, implemented via a deed of company arrangement.

The most common method for appointment of an administrator is for the company’s board to resolve
that in the opinion of the directors voting for the resolution, the company is insolvent, or is likely to become

461


-----

insolvent at some future time and that an administrator should be appointed. A creditor with a charge over the
whole, or substantially the whole, of the company’s property can also appoint an administrator, as can a liquidator
or provisional liquidator (if the company is already in liquidation or provisional liquidation).

The Australian Corporations Act provides that the aim of the voluntary administration regime is to
maximize the chances of the company surviving, or if not possible, to maximize the return available to creditors.
In this sense, and particularly the first limb of the aim, it is not dissimilar to the focus on corporate rehabilitation
as part of the U.S. Chapter 11 process, but there are some key differences, including that:

    - the company’s directors are relieved of their powers during the administration period (subject to the
administrator’s written approval to them exercising a function or power as a director) and the
administration is conducted by an independent insolvency practitioner who must be a registered
liquidator;

    - a voluntary administration can take place entirely without court involvement (although it is common
for court applications to be made in relation to the conduct of the administration and the liability of
the administrator);

    - contractual counterparties are generally at liberty to terminate their contracts with the company if
they have a contractual right to do so arising from the appointment of the administrator (though see
comments below regarding the statutory stay on enforcing ‘ipso facto’ rights in this regard); and

    - a secured creditor with a security interest over the whole or substantially the whole of the property
of the company which, where relevant, has been perfected under the Personal Property Securities
_Act 2009_ (Cth), is entitled to enforce that security interest within 13 business days after the
appointment of the administrator is notified to them (or such longer time as the court may order or
the administrator may agree in writing).

Administration is generally intended to last for a short period of time; however, in practice, the period is
typically extended by court order. For complex matters (including those with cross border elements), extensions
of up to, and at times more that, 12 months are not uncommon. During the administration period, the administrator
controls the company and acts as its agent, while the powers of the directors and officers of the company are
suspended. The administrator has very broad powers including the power to trade on the company and sell its
assets. Importantly, an administrator is a fiduciary and officer of the company, and as such is subject to the duties
applicable to company officers. The administrator is personally liable for debts of the company incurred during
the administration period for services rendered, goods bought, property leased or occupied and funds borrowed.
The administrator has a statutory right to be indemnified out of the company’s property for these and other
liabilities (s 443D of the Australian Corporations Act), which indemnity is secured by a statutory lien on the
company’s property (s 443F(1) of the Australian Corporations Act) and takes priority over all other unsecured
debts (s443E(1)(a) of the Australian Corporations Act) This regime is intended to encourage suppliers, employees
and customers to continue to trade with the company during the administration period.

To permit the administrator the opportunity to do this, during the administration period there is a
moratorium on the enforcement of creditors’ claims and actions against the company and its property (subject to
certain exceptions) and also a stay on legal proceedings which will prevent, amongst other things, security being
enforced (subject to certain exceptions) in each case without the consent of the administrator or order of the court.
In addition, guarantees granted by the directors of the company (or their spouses and relatives) cannot be enforced
during the administration period except with leave of the Court.

There are two meetings of creditors required to be held during an administration. The most important of
these is the second creditors’ meeting, which must be convened within 20 business days of the administrator’s
appointment or such longer period as the court orders (on application by the company). Prior to the second
creditors’ meeting, the administrator must provide creditors with a report about the company’s business, property,
affairs and financial circumstances, sets out the details of any proposed deed of company arrangement, and
provides the administrator’s opinion as to whether it is in the interests of the creditors to either: (a) execute the
proposed deed of company arrangement; (b) end the administration and return the company to the control of its
directors; or (c) wind up the company.

The administration period and associated statutory moratoriums end when the creditors resolve in favour
of one of these options at the second creditors’ meeting or in the case (a), once the deed of company arrangement
is executed by the company and the deed administrator (which execution must occur within 15 business days after

462


-----

the end of the second creditors’ meeting or such further period as the court allows on an application made during
those 15 days).

_Deed of Company Arrangement_

A deed of company arrangement (“DOCA”) is a statutory contract between the company and its creditors
(and sometimes others) that governs the relations between those parties after the end of an administration. The
Australian Corporations Act is relatively flexible on the contents of the DOCA, however there are certain
minimum requirements, including the nature and duration of any moratorium period, property available to pay
creditors, the order of payments to creditors, the release of the debts of the company and termination provisions.
Once the DOCA is executed, the administration ends and the statutory moratorium restrictions come to an end
and are replaced by the provisions of the DOCA, which may include similar moratorium protections.

A DOCA is administered by a deed administrator (usually the same insolvency practitioner who acted
as voluntary administrator) who is generally tasked by the deed with realizing assets, closing down the business,
restructuring the company or pursuing litigation with a view to the payment of dividends to creditors.

A resolution at the second creditors’ meeting to execute a DOCA must be passed by a simple majority
vote (in number, unless a poll is conducted in which case it is by number and value of debts and claims). A DOCA
once executed will bind all unsecured creditors whose debts are provable, the company itself, directors and
members. Secured creditors who did not vote in favour of the DOCA will not generally be bound by the deed
(including any moratorium provisions contained in it).

A DOCA can (if so expressed) have the effect of extinguishing the debt of a secured creditor that did not
vote in favour of the resolution to execute the DOCA pursuant to s 444D(1) of the Australian Corporations Act.
However, this extinguishment is subject to the preservation of the secured creditor’s ability (by virtue of s 444D(2)
of the Act) to realize or deal with its security interest in respect of the secured property and to the extent that its
debt was provable and secured assets were available at the date that debt would otherwise be released under the
DOCA, without requiring that that debt be preserved into the future or for other purposes.

A DOCA can be terminated in accordance with its terms, by an order of an Australian court, or in certain
circumstances by resolution of the company’s creditors.

_Liquidation_

A liquidation (also known as a winding up) is the process by which the liquidator takes control of the
company from its directors, and undertakes the tasks of realizing all of the company’s assets, the calling up of
partly paid shares and the distribution of the proceeds among the company’s creditors and (if there is a surplus
after paying creditors) a distribution of the surplus to members. The distribution of proceeds will be subject to
statutory priority rules. Following a liquidation, the company will be deregistered and will cease to exist as a
corporate identity.

For an insolvent company, a liquidation can take the form of either a court ordered or “compulsory”
liquidation, or a creditors’ “voluntary” liquidation (including following a voluntary administration or a DOCA).
Creditors of the company and certain other eligible applicants can apply to the court to have a company wound
up on a range of bases, including insolvency. The members of a company may also elect to wind up a company
solvently.

A liquidator has extensive powers, including the power to compel the production of books of the
company, and to investigate the company’s affairs by way of public examinations of officers or persons otherwise
involved in the affairs of the company. Importantly, liquidators can also recover property by avoiding certain
pre-liquidation transactions. Generally, liquidators will not trade on a company that is being wound up, as the
winding up procedure is terminal.

During a liquidation, the powers of directors are suspended, a transfer of shares in a company is void
(unless done with the liquidator or court’s consent) and there is a stay of any proceedings against the company
and a prohibition on enforcement (by unsecured creditors) except with the leave of the court. Liquidation of itself
will not alter the obligations of counterparties under contracts, unless the liquidator performs, repudiates or
disclaims the contract.

In a winding up, all unsecured creditors with debts or claims (including contingent, future and
unliquidated claims) against the company are entitled to participate for dividends from the available assets in

463


-----

respect of their debt or claim. Claims are submitted to and adjudicated by the liquidator in a quasi judicial capacity
pursuant to the proof of debt procedures in the Australian Corporations Act and regulations. Specific debts and
claims will take priority over the claims of unsecured creditors, including the expenses incurred by an
administrator/liquidator, the costs of obtaining any order for liquidation, and employee entitlements. All other
unsecured debts rank equally according to the pari passu principle. If the property of the company is insufficient
to meet the outstanding debts and claims in full, they must be paid proportionately.

On liquidation, unsecured creditors have no rights to specific items of the company’s assets; as noted
however they have a right to lodge a proof of debt and an entitlement to their pro rata entitlement to a fund of
assets protected and properly administered.

Secured creditors are not impacted by the liquidation to the extent they are entitled to enforce their
security interest during the liquidation (subject to the rights of any prior security holders and any applicable
intercreditor arrangements), assuming it is not void as against the liquidator. Secured creditors who are otherwise
able under their respective security agreements have the right to appoint a receiver and manager and enforce
against the property secured in their favour during the liquidation.

_Receivership_

A receiver is typically appointed by a secured creditor pursuant to a security agreement providing for
that secured creditor’s security interest, after the company has defaulted under the security agreement and in
accordance with its terms. The receiver may also act as a manager of the company, and as such may sideline the
other officers of the company (including the directors or an administrator or liquidator). Receivership is a regime
implemented for the benefit of the secured creditor that appoints the receiver. This is in contrast to the
administration, DOCA and liquidation regimes, which are primarily aimed at securing the best outcome for all of
the company’s creditors as a whole. The receiver has no direct role in relation to the unsecured creditors of the
company, and it is possible to have a receivership in place concurrently with an administration or liquidation.
There is no moratorium or stay on the enforcement of claims against a company in receivership, as there is in
administration and liquidation. Where a company grants security over an asset, the proceeds of enforcement must
generally be remitted to the secured party (subject to priority creditors and any applicable intercreditor
arrangements).

One exception to this is that where assets are subject to a security interest over circulating assets, the
receiver must pay or provide for priority payments from their proceeds before accounting to the secured party.
Priority payments are those listed in s 433(3) of the Australian Corporations Act and include liabilities in respect
of certain insurance policies, auditors’ fees and employees’ wages and superannuation and certain other employee
entitlements, and the amount owing to the administrator on account of his or her fees, costs and expenses. In a
liquidation scenario, unpaid employee entitlements can be met by the Australian Commonwealth Government in
certain circumstances, which is then subrogated to those employees' rights in the liquidation.

_Creditors’ Scheme of Arrangement_

A scheme of arrangement is an arrangement or compromise which binds the company and its creditors
or members.

In brief, there are two different types of schemes: members’ schemes and creditors’ schemes. Before
either type of scheme can be implemented it must be approved by the Court, the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission and the members or creditors of the company respectively. Creditors’ schemes of
arrangement are becoming more widely used in an insolvency context.

A creditors’ scheme needs to be approved by voting creditors constituting 75% in value and 50% in
number and each separate class of creditors (if any) needs to approve the resolution.

A creditors’ scheme will often involve a proposal to defer, compromise or extinguish the company’s
debts. A typical scenario would involve a moratorium in respect of claims against the company and a compromise
of debts owed by it (and/or a modification of the rights of creditors or a class of them in relation to the company).
Once the requisite approvals have been obtained, the scheme will be binding on all creditors (including dissenting
creditors). Unlike a DOCA, schemes of arrangement can bind secured creditors, owners and lessors in respect of
their property and can release third party claims provided there is sufficient nexus between the release and the
debtor’s obligations.

464


-----

Schemes are, however, extremely flexible and can be utilized to implement any arrangement relating to
the rights and obligations of the company and its creditors, save that a scheme which is contrary to law, or not in
the public interest, is unlikely to be approved by the Court (even if it has the support of creditors).

**_Voidable transactions_**

Liquidators have the power to investigate the affairs of the company and to take appropriate legal action
against directors or third parties to recover certain assets or undo certain transactions for the purpose of increasing
the estate available for distribution to unsecured creditors. The Guarantee granted by Lima Australia might be
subject to review under Australian laws relating to voidable transactions (s 588FE of the Australian Corporations
Act). Also, any loans to Lima Australia may be subject to review under Australian laws relating to voidable
transactions as an unfair loan (s 588FD of the Australian Corporations Act). The voidable transaction powers are
only available to a liquidator of Lima Australia. If the entry into the Guarantee constitutes a voidable transaction
under Part 5.7B of the Australian Corporations Act, noteholders could be required to disgorge payments made by
Lima Australia in an insolvency proceeding.

If, on the application of a company’s liquidator, a court is satisfied that a transaction of the company is
a voidable transaction, it may make a variety of orders which are set out in section 588FF of the Australian
Corporations Act. These orders include an order releasing or discharging, wholly or partly, a debt incurred, or a
security or guarantee given, by the company under or in connection with the transaction, or an order requiring a
party to repay to the company some or all of the money it received under the transaction.

_Unfair Preferences_

An unfair preference is a transaction between a company and a creditor which results in the creditor
receiving from the company, in respect of an unsecured debt, more than it would receive if the transaction were
set aside and the creditor were to prove for the debt in a winding up of the company (s 588FA(1) of the Australian
Corporations Act).

An unfair preference is an insolvent transaction if the company either: (i) is insolvent when the
transaction is entered into or when an act is done (or an omission is made) for the purpose of giving effect to the
transaction; or (ii) becomes insolvent because of, or because of matters including, entering into the transaction or
because of a person doing an act (or making an omission) for the purpose of giving effect to the transaction (s
588FC of the Australian Corporations Act).

An unfair preference that is an insolvent transaction is voidable if it was entered into (or an act was done
for the purpose of giving effect to it): (i) during the six months ending on the relation-back day (as explained
below); (ii) after the relation-back day but on or before the day when the winding up began (s 588FE(2) of the
Corporations Act); or (iii) if a related entity of the company was a party to the transaction, during the four years
ending on the relation-back day (s 588FE(4) of the Australian Corporations Act). Section 91 of the Australian
Corporations Act defines “relation-back day” and describes 15 circumstances in each of which the “relation-back
day” is separately identified. The relation-back day differs depending on variables such as whether:

    - the liquidation is court-ordered or voluntary;

    - the company was under administration or subject to a deed of company arrangement when the
winding up order was made or the resolution to wind up was passed;

    - the deed of company arrangement specifies circumstances in which the deed is to terminate and
those circumstances have occurred;

    - the application to wind up or notice of the resolution to wind up occurred before or after the
beginning of the administration;

    - in the case of a voluntary winding up, an application for a court ordered winding up has been made
and if so, whether the application was made before or after the administration commenced; and

    - the company’s creditors have passed a resolution terminating a deed of company arrangement.

    - In respect of each particular circumstance, section 91 (when read in conjunction with ss 513A, 513B
and 513C) of the Australian Corporations Act specifies a relation-back day which is one of the
following:

465


-----

    - the date on which an application for winding up is filed with the Court;

    - the date on which the administration began;

    - the date on which the Court orders the winding up; or

    - the date on which the special resolution to wind up the company was passed.

_Uncommercial Transactions_

A transaction is an uncommercial transaction under s 588FB(1) of the Australian Corporations Act if it
may be expected that a reasonable person in the company’s circumstances would not have entered into the
transaction, having regard to: (i) the benefits (if any) to the company of entering into the transaction; (ii) the
detriment to the company of entering into the transaction; (iii) the respective benefits to other parties to the
transaction of entering into it; and (iv) any other relevant matter. “Transaction” is broadly defined and generally
includes the provision of a guarantee. A guarantee would not constitute an uncommercial transaction if the benefit
to the company providing the guarantee in the context of the transaction outweighs the detriment that could be
incurred by the company in providing the guarantee.

An uncommercial transaction that is an insolvent transaction (as that term is explained above) is voidable
if it was entered into (or an act was done for the purpose of giving effect to it) during: (i) the two years ending on
the relation-back day (s 588FE(3) of the Australian Corporations Act); or (ii) if a related entity of the company
was a party to the transaction, the four years ending on the relation-back day (s 588FE(4) of the Australian
Corporations Act). The “relation-back day” has the same meaning as described above under the unfair preferences
section.

_Unfair Loan_

A loan may be challenged on the basis it is an unfair loan under s 588FD of the Australian Corporations
Act if interest or other charges in relation to the loan are considered to be extortionate when the loan was made,
or has since become extortionate because of a variation. In determining whether interest or charges were or became
extortionate, regard is given to a number of factors (with reference to the applicable time) including the risk to
which the lender was exposed, the value of the security in respect of the loan, the term of the loan, the repayment
schedule, the amount of the loan and any other relevant matter.

_Circulating security interests_

Further, upon liquidation, a circulating security interest, being a security interest that attaches to
circulating assets (as to which, see above), that was granted within six months of the commencement of the
liquidation, is void against the liquidator, except so far as the security secures, among other things, (A) advances
of new money to the grantor company, (B) a liability under a guarantee or other obligation undertaken at or after
the time of the grant of security on behalf of or for the benefit of the grantor company, or (C) an amount payable
for new property or services provided to the company. This arises under s 588FJ of the Australian Corporations
Act. Section 588FJ does not apply where the grantor company was solvent immediately after the grant of the
security.

Where a liquidator successfully challenges a transaction such as a guarantee and avoids that transaction,
then this can prevent the enforcement of the security interest and any money paid or received under that transaction
can become the subject of a court order for repayment.

_Unreasonable director-related transactions_

Transactions between a company on the one hand, and a director or his or her close associate on the
other, are treated as voidable on a winding up of the company if they occur in circumstances where a reasonable
person in the company's circumstances would not have entered into the transaction: s 588FDA. This section
applies in respect of: payments made by the company; a conveyance, transfer or other disposition by the company
of its property; the issue of securities by the company; or its incurring an obligation to make such a payment,
disposition or issue: s 588FDA(1)(a) of the Australian Corporations Act. Whether a reasonable person in the
company's circumstances would not have entered into the transaction is determined having regard to: any benefits
to the company of entering into it; the detriment to the company of entering into it; the respective benefits to other
parties to the transaction of entering into it; and any other relevant matter: s 588FDA(1)(c). The test whether such
a transaction is unreasonable is objective in character and the matters specified in s 588FDA(1)(c) must be taken

466


-----

into account in determining that matter, and a transaction may be unreasonable although its proponent is both sole
director and shareholder of a company.

_Creditor-defeating dispositions_

A transaction which is a “creditor defeating disposition” within the scope of s 588FDB of the Australian
Corporations Act may be voidable on a winding up of a company. A disposition of property of a company is a
creditor defeating disposition within s 588FDB(1) if (1) the consideration payable to the company for the
disposition was less than the lesser of (i) the market value of the property or (ii) the best price that was reasonably
obtainable for the property, having regard to the circumstances existing at that time the relevant agreement (as
defined in s 9) for the disposition was made or, if there was no such agreement, at the time of the disposition; and
(2) the disposition has the effect of preventing the property from becoming available for the benefit of the
company’s creditors in the winding up of the company; or hindering, or significantly delaying, the process of
making the property available for the benefit of the company’s creditors in the winding up of the company. Section
588FDB(2) extends the concept of a creditor defeating disposition to the position where a company does
something that results in another person becoming the owner of property that did not previously exist; and, under
s 588FDB(3), if (1) a company makes a disposition of property to another person and the other person gives some
or all of the consideration for the disposition to a person other than the company (“third party), then the company
is taken to have made a disposition of the property constituting so much of the consideration as was given to the
third party. Broadly, a creditor-defeating disposition is voidable under s 588FE(6B) if made by a company at the
time when it is insolvent or, because of the disposition, the company immediately becomes insolvent or (in certain
circumstances) enters external administration within the 12 months after the transaction.

**_Automatic stay on Ipso Facto clauses_**

The Australian Corporations Act contains two kinds of stay provisions:

(a) an automatic stay on the enforcement of certain ipso facto rights; and

(b) stay orders in respect of a potentially broader range of rights (e.g. termination for
convenience rights), where a court is convinced such rights are or might be exercised or there is a threat
that they might be exercised solely because the company has entered a prescribed insolvency process
(see below).

_Automatic Stay for Ipso Facto rights_

The Australian Corporations provides for an automatic stay (“Automatic Stay”) on the enforcement of
contractual rights that are triggered merely because:

(a) the company has publicly announced that it will apply for, has in fact applied for or
become subject to, a creditor’s scheme of arrangement for the purpose of avoiding being wound up in
liquidation;

(b) a receiver or other managing controller has been appointed to the whole or
substantially the whole of the company’s property;

(c) an administrator has been appointed to the company;

(d) the company has come or is under restructuring pursuant to Part 5.3B of the Australian
Corporations Act; or

(e) the company’s financial position or any other reason prescribed in the regulations,
where one of the abovementioned circumstances has occurred.

The Automatic Stay operates during the following stay periods:

(a) in the case of a scheme designed to avoid the company being wound up in insolvency,
during a period that starts when the company publicly announces that it will or otherwise does in fact,
apply to hold a scheme meeting under s 411 of the Australian Corporations Act, and ends:

(i) if the company fails to make the announced application – at the end of 3
months after the announcement, or such longer period as is ordered by a court;

467


-----

(ii) when the application is withdrawn or rejected by the court; or

(iii) when the scheme ends, unless this occurs because the company is to be wound
up, in which case when the company’s affairs have been fully wound up.

(b) in the case of a receivership or managing controllership, during a period that starts
when the receiver or managing controller is appointed and ends when the receiver’s or managing
controller’s control ends or such later time as is ordered by the court;

(c) in the case of an administration, during a period that starts when the company comes
under administration and ends the latest of:

(i) when the administration ends;

(ii) if an application is made before the administration ends to extend the period
of the stay – when the court so orders; or

(iii) if the administration ends because of a resolution or order for the company to
be wound up – when the company’s affairs have been fully wound up.

(d) in the case of a company under restructuring under Part 5.3B of the Australian
Corporations Act, during the period when the restructuring of the company begins and ending at the later
of:

(i) when the restructuring ends;

(ii) if an application is made before the restructuring ends to extend the period of
the stay – when the court so orders;

(iii) if the restructuring ends because of a resolution or order for the company to
be wound up – when the company’s affairs have been fully wound up.

In addition, and notwithstanding the abovementioned stay periods, the Australian Corporations Act also
makes provision for rights to remain unenforceable indefinitely against the company (i.e. beyond the expiry of
the relevant stay period), where the reason for seeking to enforce the right is:

(a) the company’s financial position before the end of the stay period;

(b) the fact that the company experienced before the end of the stay period any of the
abovementioned circumstances which could or did trigger the Automatic Stay in the first place; or

(c) a prescribed reason relating to the circumstances in existence during the stay period.

These particular provisions (namely ss 415D(4), 434J(4), 451E(4) and 454N(4) of the Australian of
Corporations Act) are very significant, as they effectively make the Automatic Stay permanent.

That being said, companies should be aware that:

(a) The Automatic Stay does not apply to rights arising under all contracts. The stay will
not apply to:

(i) rights arising under contracts entered into after the court approves the scheme,
the receiver or managing controller is appointed or the company comes under administration or
restructuring (as relevant);

(ii) other types of contracts or contractual rights prescribed in the regulations or
by ministerial declaration; or

(iii) rights where the scheme administrator, receiver or managing controller,
administrator or restructuring practitioner (as relevant) has consented in writing to the
enforcement of the right.

468


-----

(b) Courts will have the power to lift the Automatic Stay in respect of certain ipso facto
rights if satisfied that doing so is in the interests of justice or (in the case of a scheme only) the relevant
scheme is not for the purpose of the company avoiding being wound up; and

(c) Contractual counterparties cannot be required to provide the company with additional
credit or money during a period where one or more of the counterparty’s own rights cannot be enforced
against the company by reason of the Automatic Stay. As noted above and notwithstanding the comment
above regarding the Automatic Stay “effectively” being made permanent, this concomitant stay on the
company’s ability to demand additional credit does not extend beyond the expiry of the relevant and
abovementioned stay periods.

_Stay Orders in respect of potentially broader range of contractual rights_

The Australian Corporations Act also provides that courts will be able to make orders that for a period
of time specified in the order, one or more rights under a contract may only be enforced with the leave of the
Court or on terms imposed by the court (“Stay Orders”), if the court is satisfied that the relevant right:

(a) is being exercised;

(b) might be exercised; or

(c) there is a threat that it might be exercised, merely because the company has
experienced any of the circumstances which could or did trigger an Automatic Stay. It is also possible
for a court to make interim orders before deciding an application for a Stay Order.

While it is clear that Stay Orders may not be granted in respect of rights specifically carved out from the
operation of the Automatic Stay (see discussion above), as there are no other limitations on the types of contractual
rights which may be the subject of Stay Orders, these Stay Orders will be able to be made in respect of a potentially
broader range of contractual rights than the Automatic Stay. In this regard, 415F(1),434L(4), 451G(1) and
454Q(1) of the Australian Corporations Act notes that a Stay Order could be sought for example, in respect of a
right to terminate for convenience.

The Ipso Facto provisions commenced on 1 July 2018.

The Automatic Stay does not interfere with the right of a substantially secured creditor to appoint a
receiver during its 13 business day decision period following the appointment of administrators (discussed above).

**New Zealand**

One of the Guarantors, Lima New Zealand, is incorporated under the laws of New Zealand. In New
Zealand, there are general limitations on the validity and the enforceability of the Guarantee to be taken into
consideration.

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees of any Guarantor incorporated in New Zealand must
be in the best interests of the New Zealand company (or its holding company if its constitution so provides).

The question of best interests must be determined on a case by case basis.

If directors cause the company to give guarantees which are not in the best interests of the company or
its holding company (where permitted under its constitution), they can be sued for breach of duties and serious
breaches are an offence, but generally the guarantees and supporting security cannot be set aside unless on the
application of a prejudiced shareholder the court considers in the circumstances that it is just and equitable to do
so.

Directors also owe other duties to companies of which they are the directors. These include the duty to
exercise their power as a director for a proper purpose, the requirement to not agree to the company incurring an
obligation unless the director believes at that time on reasonable grounds that the company will be able to perform
the obligation when required to do so, the requirement not to agree to, cause or allow the business of the company
to be carried on in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company’s creditors, and the
requirement to exercise care, diligence and skill that a reasonable director would exercise in the same
circumstances.

469


-----

In the event of an insolvency of the Lima New Zealand, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in New
Zealand and New Zealand insolvency law would govern those proceedings.

**_Liquidation_**

As a New Zealand incorporated company, a liquidator may be appointed under New Zealand law to Lima
New Zealand. On a liquidation of a New Zealand company, certain categories of preferential debts and the claims
of secured creditors would be paid in priority to the claims of unsecured creditors and certain secured creditors.
Such preferential debts would comprise of, among other things, costs associated with liquidation, employee claims
(up to a statutory cap), payments related to Kiwisaver (the New Zealand employee saver scheme), certain claims
of the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department, claims of lien holders in relation to debts for the provisions of
services to the company before the liquidation, claims of certain buyers of goods under the Fair Trading Act 1986,
and the costs incurred in organizing and conducting a meeting of creditors for the purpose of voting on a proposed
compromise.

Accordingly, if Lima New Zealand becomes subject to an insolvency proceeding and the relevant
company has obligations to creditors that are preferred under New Zealand law, the noteholders may suffer losses
as a result of not having preferred status during such insolvency proceedings. In particular, where the assets of the
company are insufficient to meet the claims of the preferential creditors, the New Zealand Companies Act 1993
(“New Zealand Companies Act”) provides that the claims of certain preferential creditors are to be paid out of
any accounts receivable or inventory of the company in priority to a secured creditor with a security interest in
those same accounts receivable or inventory, unless the security meets certain safe harbor criteria.

Preferred creditors will have priority over a secured creditor to the extent that the secured creditor’s
security interest:

      - is over all or any part of the company’s accounts receivable and inventory or all or any part of
either of them;

      - is not a purchase money security interest that has been perfected at the time specified in the
New Zealand Personal Property Securities Act 1999 (“New Zealand PPSA”); and

      - is not a security interest that has been perfected under the New Zealand PPSA at the
commencement of the liquidation and that arises from the transfer of an account receivable for
which new value is provided by the transferee for the acquisition of that account receivable
(whether or not the transfer of the account receivable secures payment or performance of an
obligation).

_Section 293—voidable charges_

Under New Zealand insolvency law a liquidator of Lima New Zealand could apply to the Court to have
certain transactions entered into by any of the companies before the commencement of liquidation set aside.
Section 293 of the New Zealand Companies Act provides that a charge given by a company is voidable by a
liquidator if:

      - the charge was given:

i. any time up to six months before the commencement of liquidation of that company
(the “Specified Period”); and

ii. immediately after the charge was given, the company was unable to pay its due debts;
or

      - the charge was given to a related party:

i. any time up to two years before the commencement of liquidation of that company
(the “Related Party Specified Period”); and

ii. immediately after the charge was given, the company was unable to pay its due debts.

470


-----

However, a charge meeting these requirements will not be voidable to the extent that it secures money
actually advanced or paid, or the actual price or value of property sold or supplied to the company, or any other
valuable consideration given by the charge holder (acting in good faith) at or after the time the charge was granted
(section 293(1A)(a)).

_Section 292—insolvent transactions_

Under sections 292(1) and 292(1A) of the New Zealand Companies Act, a transaction by a company is
voidable by the liquidator if it is an “insolvent transaction” entered into in the Specified Period or entered into
with a related party of the company within the Related Party Specified Period. The definition of “transaction” for
this purpose includes the creation of a charge over the company’s property, and that term will include the grant
of a guarantee (as may be granted by Lima New Zealand).

Section 292(2) provides that an insolvent transaction is a transaction by a company that:

      - is entered into at a time when the company is unable to pay its due debts; and

      - enables another person to receive more towards satisfaction of a debt owed by the company
than the person would receive, or would be likely to receive, in the company’s liquidation.

_Sections 296 and 296A—voidable dispositions_

A disposition of a company’s property is voidable if it is made during the period beginning on the date
on which an application is made to appoint a liquidator and ending at the time the liquidator is appointed (or the
court otherwise disposes of the application).

A court is not able to order the recovery of property of a company (or its equivalent value) by a liquidator,
if the person from whom recovery is sought proves that when it received the property, it:

      - acted in good faith;

      - a reasonable person in its position would not have suspected, and it did not have reasonable
grounds to suspect, that the company was, or would become, insolvent; and

      - it gave value for the property or altered its position in the reasonably held belief that the transfer
of property to it was valid and would not be set aside.

_Section 297—transactions at an undervalue_

Section 297(2) of the New Zealand Companies Act provides that in the liquidation of a company, the
liquidator may recover from any other party to a transaction any amount by which the value of the consideration
or benefit provided by the company exceeded the value of the consideration or benefit received by the company
where:

      - the transaction was entered into by the company any time up to two years before the
commencement of liquidation of that company; and

      - either:

(i) the company was unable to pay its due debts when it entered into the transaction; or

(ii) the company became unable to pay its due debts as a result of entering into the
transaction.

For the purposes of section 297, “transaction” has the same meaning as in section 292, and accordingly
the definition would capture both the guarantee and the grant of security which Lima New Zealand may grant.

471


-----

_Sections 292 and 293—ability to pay due debts_

The voidability of a charge under each of sections 292 and 293 depends in part on the failure of the
company to satisfy a cashflow solvency test (whether the company in question is unable to pay its due debts).
Balance sheet solvency is not relevant.

Under both sections 292 and 293 of the Act, a company is presumed to be unable to pay its due debts if
the relevant transaction was effected within six months of liquidation. In such circumstances, the burden of proof
is on the relevant creditor to prove otherwise.

_Section 348 of the Property Law Act 2007_

A transaction that was made with intent to prejudice a creditor, or by way of gift, or without receiving
reasonable equivalent value in exchange may be subject to a vesting order or a compensatory order under section
348 of the Property Law Act 2007.

**_Voluntary Administration_**

Voluntary administration is a procedure available under the New Zealand Companies Act, to facilitate
the survival of New Zealand companies in financial difficulties. The New Zealand Companies Act provides that
the company, a liquidator, an interim liquidator (if applicable), a secured creditor holding a charge over the whole
or substantially the whole of the company’s property, or the Court may appoint an administrator.

The object of the voluntary administration regime is to provide for the business, property and affairs of
insolvent companies, or companies that may become insolvent, to be administered in a way that maximizes the
chances of the company continuing in business (or, if that is not possible, to get a better return for the company’s
creditors and shareholders than would result from immediate liquidation). The regime is intended to be employed
before liquidation becomes unavoidable.

A moratorium is imposed on creditors from the commencement of the voluntary administration. This
gives the administrator a period (during which creditors cannot commence or continue proceedings against the
company, or enforce security against its assets) to investigate the affairs of the company and put a plan in place.
However, secured creditors with a security interest in substantially the whole of a company’s property can avoid
this moratorium if they enforce their security (including by the appointment of receivers if the terms of their
security permits it) within the first ten working days of a company being placed into administration.

If, for any reason, an administrator was appointed to Lima New Zealand while any amounts due by the
Issuer under the Notes were unpaid, the primary risk to the noteholders is that they would only be able to exercise
enforcement rights against Lima New Zealand (whether by appointing a receiver to the entity or otherwise) during
the moratorium if the exercise of those enforcement rights was commenced within ten working days of the
company being placed into administration.

The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event of Lima New Zealand becoming insolvent, a guarantee or
any payment under it will not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would uphold such
guarantee.

**_Receivership_**

A receiver is typically appointed by a secured creditor pursuant to a security agreement containing that
secured creditor’s security interest, after the company has defaulted under the security agreement. Receivership
is a regime implemented for the benefit of the secured creditor that appoints the receiver. The receiver owes its
primary duty to the secured creditor that appoints it. This is in contrast to both the administration and liquidation
regimes, which are aimed at securing the best outcome for all of the company’s creditors as a whole and its
members. The receiver has no direct role in relation to the unsecured creditors of the company, and it is possible
to have a receivership in place concurrently with an administration or liquidation. There is no moratorium or stay
on the enforcement of claims against a company in receivership, as there is in administration and liquidation.

472


-----

**_Withholding taxes_**

The enforcement of any guarantee provided by Lima New Zealand may have New Zealand withholding
tax implications.

Any payment Lima New Zealand makes under the guarantee to non-New Zealand tax resident recipients
(without New Zealand fixed establishments) to replace interest that would otherwise have been paid by the Issuer,
will be subject to non-resident withholding tax (“NRWT”). Lima New Zealand will be required to deduct the
NRWT from the gross amount of the payment made.

The NRWT deduction rate is 15% of the payment made. However, a 10% deduction rate is normally
available where the interest recipient is tax resident in a country with which New Zealand has concluded a double
tax agreement. In addition, the NRWT deduction rate would be reduced to 0% if Lima New Zealand elected to
pay approved issuer levy.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date,
with a common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under
the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the “Global
**Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and registered**
in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (“144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interest” and, together with the 144A
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear
and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be
shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear
and/or Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will be issued only in
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with
the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interest in the Global Notes will not have the Notes
registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be
considered the registered owners or “holder” of the Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the nominee of the common depository for Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable will be considered the holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As
such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they
own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer, the Registrar, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, and their respective agents, nor the
Trustee under the Indenture nor any of the Issuer’s respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for
any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes (as defined below):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture; or

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to
be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names of
holders and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as

474


-----

applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes
will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or
applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a
partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the
transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor
or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed; provided that a
Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an Authenticating
Agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and
our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive
Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us,
the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any
loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge
for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the
indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase
such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and
their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner
thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will
be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is
a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of
the Book- Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such
Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will
be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of
such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit
their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions); provided,
_however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less €100,000 principal amount at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in_
part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent
will, in turn, make such payments to the common depository for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute
such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

475


-----

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent
will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for example, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective
nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any Paying Agent or any of their respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

    - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered
in “street name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations
of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer
Agent, Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from
any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to
foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes (the “Euroclear/Clearstream Holders”) through Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of the notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves
the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such
Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with Euroclear
and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical
delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes
in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of
the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

After the expiration of the 40-day distribution period (as defined in Regulation S), beneficial interests in
a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest
in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same currency without compliance with these certification
requirements.

476


-----

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt
by the Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act
(if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any
Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a
Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global
Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable
to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book- Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book- Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Notice to
_Investors.”_

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or any of their respective agents are responsible for those operations or
procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, they also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the Euroclear and Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes
only through Euroclear and Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF
Market and listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global
Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with
their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent,
the Registrar or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or

477


-----

their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing
their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business.

478


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_Potential investors and sellers of the Notes should be aware that they may be required to pay stamp taxes_
_or other documentary taxes or fiscal duties or charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country_
_where the Notes are transferred or other jurisdictions. In addition, payments of interest on the Notes, or income_
_derived from the Notes, may be subject to taxation, including withholding taxes, in the jurisdiction of the Issuer,_
_in the jurisdiction of the holder of Notes, or in other jurisdictions in which the holder of Notes is required to pay_
_taxes. Any such tax consequences may have an impact on the net income received from the Notes._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences,_
_under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation,_
_the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale or redemption of, the Notes or any interest_
_therein. Finally, potential investors should be aware that tax regulations and their application by the relevant_
_taxation authorities change from time to time, with or without retroactive effect. Accordingly, it is not possible to_
_predict the precise tax treatment that will apply at any given time._

**Certain Italian tax considerations**

The statements herein regarding Italian taxation are based on the laws and published practice of the
Italian tax authorities in effect in Italy as of the date of this offering memorandum and are subject to any changes
in law occurring after such date, which changes could be made on a retroactive basis. The following is a summary
only of the material Italian tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Notes for Italian
resident and non-Italian resident beneficial owners, although it is not intended to be, nor should it be constructed
to be, legal or tax advice. The following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the
tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes and does not
purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers
in securities or commodities) may be subject to special rules. Neither the Issuer nor any other entity belonging to
the Group will update this summary to reflect changes in law or in the interpretation thereof and, if any such
change occurs, the information in this summary could be superseded.

**_Tax treatment of interest_**

Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (“Decree No. 239”) sets forth the applicable regime
regarding the tax treatment of interest, premium and other income (including the difference between the
redemption amount and the issue price, hereinafter collectively referred to as “Interest”) deriving from Notes
falling within the category of bonds (obbligazioni) and similar securities (pursuant to Article 44 of Presidential
Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as amended and supplemented (“Decree No. 917”)), issued, inter alia,
by:

(a) companies resident of Italy for tax purposes whose shares are listed on a regulated
market or on a multilateral trading platform of EU Member States or States party to the EEA Agreement
allowing a satisfactory exchange of information with the Italian tax authorities as included in (i) the
decree of the ministry of Economy and Finance of September 4, 1996 as subsequently amended and
supplemented or (ii) once effective, any other decree that will be issued in the future under Article 11
paragraph 4 letter c) of Decree No. 239 (any of such decrees, the “White List”); or

(b) companies resident of Italy for tax purposes whose shares are not listed, issuing notes
traded (negoziati) upon their issuance on the aforementioned regulated markets or platforms; or

(c) if not traded on the aforementioned markets or multilateral trading platforms, when
such notes are held by “qualified investors” pursuant to article 100 of the Italian Financial Act.

For these purposes, securities similar to bonds (“titoli similari alle obbligazioni”) are securities that
incorporate an unconditional obligation for the Issuer to actually pay, at maturity (or at any earlier redemption),
an amount not lower than their nominal/face value/principal and that do not provide any right of direct or indirect
participation in, or control on, the management of the Issuer or of the business in connection with which they are
issued.

**_Italian-resident Noteholders_**

_Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

Where an Italian-resident beneficial owner of the Notes (a “Noteholder”) is:

    - an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected;

    - a non-commercial partnership (società semplice) or a professional association;

    - a non-commercial private or public institution (other than Italian undertakings for collective
investment); or

    - an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation,

then interest derived from the Notes, and accrued during the relevant holding period, is subject to a tax
withheld at source (imposta sostitutiva), levied at a rate of 26%, unless the relevant Noteholder holds the Notes
in a discretionary investment portfolio managed by an authorized intermediary and has validly opted for the
application of the risparmio gestito regime under Article 7 of Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997
(“Decree No. 461”) (see also “—Tax treatment of capital gains—Discretionary investment portfolio regime
_(Risparmio gestito regime)” below)._

Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest,
premium and other income relating to the Notes (being financial instruments issued by an Italian resident
corporation) may be exempt from any income taxation (including the 26% imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholder
is an Italian resident individual not engaged in entrepreneurial activity and the Notes are included in a long-term
savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth under Italian tax law.

_Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

In the event that the Italian-resident Noteholders mentioned above are engaged in an entrepreneurial
activity to which the Notes are connected, the imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax. Interest will be
included in the relevant beneficial owner’s Italian income tax return and will be subject to Italian ordinary income
taxation and the imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a deduction from Italian income tax due.

Where a Noteholder is an Italian-resident company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent
establishment in Italy of a non-resident company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes are
deposited with an authorized intermediary, Interest from the Notes will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva.
Interest must, however, be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and is therefore subject to
general Italian corporate income taxation and, in certain circumstances, depending on the status of the Noteholder
and also to the Italian regional tax on productive activities (“IRAP”).

Pursuant to paragraph 6-bis of Article 1 of Law Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011, converted into
Law No. 214 of December 22, 2011, the base upon which the “Aiuto alla Crescita Economica” benefit set forth
in Article 1 of Law Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011 (the “ACE Benefit”) is computed is reduced by an
amount equal to the positive difference (if any) between (i) the aggregate book value of securities (titoli e valori
_mobiliari), including the Notes, other than shares reported in the taxpayer’s financial statements for the relevant_
fiscal year and (ii) the aggregate book value of securities (titoli e valori mobiliari) other than shares reported in
the taxpayer’s financial statements of the fiscal year that was current on December 31, 2010. Only Italian resident
persons carrying on an entrepreneurial activity (and in particular Italian resident corporations) and Italian
permanent establishments of non-resident persons can enjoy the ACE Benefit. The new restrictive rule enacted
by Finance Act 2017 applies only to taxpayers other than banks and insurance companies.

_Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs_

Payments of Interest deriving from the Notes made to Italian resident real estate investment funds and
real estate closed-ended investment companies (società di investimento a capitale fisso, or “SICAFs”), provided
that the Notes, together with the coupons relating thereto, are timely deposited directly or indirectly with an Italian
authorized financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of non-resident intermediary) are subject
neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at the level of the real estate investment fund or the real
estate SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income
realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares.

480


-----

Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment funds or real estate
SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders or shareholders irrespective of any actual
distribution on a tax transparency basis.

_Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs_

If an Italian resident Noteholder is a non-real estate open-ended or a closed-ended collective investment
fund (“Fund”) or an open-ended investment company (società di investimento a capitale variabile, or “SICAVs”)
or a non-real estate SICAF established in Italy and either (i) the Fund, the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF
or (ii) their manager is subject to the supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes are deposited with an
authorized intermediary, interest accrued during the holding period on the Notes will not be subject to imposta
_sostitutiva, but must be included in the management results of the Fund, the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF._
The Fund, the non-real estate SICAF or the SICAV are subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other
income tax at their level, but a withholding tax of 26% will be levied, in certain circumstances, by the Fund, the
non-real estate SICAF or the SICAV on proceeds distributed in favor of their unitholders or shareholders.

_Pension funds_

If an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of
Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) and the Notes are deposited with an authorized
intermediary, Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to imposta
_sostitutiva, but must be included in the results of the pension fund accrued at the end of the tax period (which will_
be subject to a 20% substitute tax).

Subject to certain conditions and requirements (including minimum holding period requirement) and
several limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment), interest relating to the Notes
may be excluded from the taxable base of the substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings
account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth under Italian tax
law.

_Application of the imposta sostitutiva_

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the imposta sostitutiva is applied by banks, brokerage companies (società
_di intermediazione mobiliare, or “SIM”), fiduciary companies,_ _società di gestione del risparmio_ (“SGR”),
stockbrokers and other entities identified by decrees of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (each, an
“Intermediary”).

An Intermediary must:

(a) be resident in Italy or be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-resident financial
intermediary; and

(b) participate, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For
the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or
other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant
Notes or in a change in the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited.

If the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by
the relevant Italian financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial
intermediary) paying the Interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are Italian
resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of non-resident corporations to which the Notes are
effectively connected are entitled to deduct imposta sostitutiva suffered from income taxes due.

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

If the Noteholder is a non-resident for tax purposes, an exemption from the imposta sostitutiva applies,
provided that the non-resident Noteholder is:

(1) a beneficial owner of the payment of Interest and resident, for tax purposes, in a state or territory
included in the White List; or

481


-----

(2) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have
entered into force in Italy; or

(3) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a state or
territory included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own state of
establishment; or

(4) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign state.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-resident Noteholders must promptly deposit the Notes together
with the coupons relating to such Notes directly or indirectly with:

(a) an Italian or non-resident bank or financial institution (there is no requirement for the
bank or financial institution to be EU resident) (the “First Level Bank”), acting as intermediary in the
deposit of the Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Noteholder with a Second Level Bank (as defined
below); or

(b) an Italian resident bank or SIM, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-resident
bank or SIM, acting as depositary or sub-depositary of the Notes appointed to maintain direct
relationships, via telematic link, with the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (the “Second Level Bank”). Organizations and companies that are not resident of Italy, acting
through a system of centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Department
of Revenue of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (which include Euroclear and Clearstream)
are treated as Second Level Banks, provided that they appoint an Italian representative (an Italian resident
bank or SIM, or the permanent establishment in Italy of a non-resident bank or SIM, or a central
depositary of financial instruments pursuant to Article 80 of Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24,
1998) for the purposes of the application of Decree No. 239. If a non-resident Noteholder deposits the
Notes directly with a Second Level Bank, the latter shall be treated both as a First Level Bank and a
Second Level Bank. The exemption from the _imposta sostitutiva_ for non-resident Noteholders is
conditional upon:

(i) the deposit of the Notes, either directly or indirectly, with an institution which
qualifies as a Second Level Bank; and

(ii) the submission to the First Level Bank or the Second Level Bank (as the case
may be) of a statement of the relevant Noteholder (autocertificazione), to be provided only once,
in which it declares, inter alia, that it is the beneficial owner of any interest on the Notes and it
is eligible to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva.

Such statement must comply with the requirements set forth by a Ministerial Decree dated December 12,
2001, is valid until withdrawn or revoked (unless some information provided therein has changed) and does not
need to be submitted where a certificate, declaration or other similar document for the same or equivalent purposes
was previously submitted to the same depository. The above statement is not required for non-Italian resident
investors that are international bodies or entities set up in accordance with international agreements entered into
force in Italy referred to in point b) above or Central Banks or entities also authorized to manage the official
reserves of a State referred to in point d) above. Additional requirements are provided for “institutional investors”
referred to in point c) above (in this respect see Circular No. 23/E of March 1, 2002 and No. 20/E of March 27,
2003).

The imposta sostitutiva will be applicable at a rate of 26% to interest paid to Noteholders who do not
qualify for the foregoing exemption or do not timely and properly satisfy the requested conditions (including the
procedures set forth under Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules). Noteholders who are subject
to the imposta sostitutiva might, nevertheless, be eligible for full or partial relief under an applicable tax treaty,
subject to timely filing of required documentation provided by Regulation of the Director of Italian Revenue
Agency No. 2013/84404 of July 10, 2013.

**Tax treatment of capital gains Italian-resident Noteholders**

_Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity._

Where an Italian-resident Noteholder is an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which
the Notes are connected, any capital gain realized by such Noteholder from the sale or redemption of the Notes

482


-----

would be subject to a capital gain tax (imposta sostitutiva, or “CGT”) levied at a rate of 26%. Noteholders may
set off any capital losses with their capital gains.

In respect of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, taxpayers may opt—under certain conditions—
for any of the three regimes described below.

_Tax return regime._

Under the tax return regime (regime della dichiarazione), which is the default regime for Italian resident
individuals not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the CGT on capital gains
will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains (net of any incurred capital loss) realized by the
Italian resident individual holding the Notes during any given tax year. Italian resident individuals holding the
Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity must indicate the overall capital gains realized in any tax
year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss, in their annual tax return, and pay the CGT on such gains, together
with any balance of income tax due for such year. Within the same time limit, capital losses in excess of capital
gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four succeeding tax years.

_Nondiscretionary investment portfolio regime (Risparmio Amministrato Regime)._

As an alternative to the tax return regime, Italian-resident individual Noteholders holding the Notes not
in connection with an entrepreneurial activity may elect to pay the CGT separately on capital gains realized on
each sale or redemption of the Notes (regime del risparmio amministrato). Such separate taxation of capital gains
is allowed subject to:

(1) the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial
intermediaries; and

(2) an express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in a timely
fashion by the relevant Noteholder.

The depository must account for the CGT in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or redemption
of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred
capital loss. The depository must also pay the CGT to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder,
deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by
the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any possible capital loss resulting
from a sale or redemption or certain other transfer of the Notes may be deducted from capital gains subsequently
realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years, up until the
fourth tax year. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital
gains/losses realized within said regime in the annual tax return.

_Discretionary investment portfolio regime (Risparmio gestito regime)._

In the _risparmio gestito regime, any capital gains realized by Italian-resident individuals holding the_
Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity and who have entrusted the management of their financial
assets (including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary, will be included in the computation of the annual
increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized, at tax year-end, subject to a 26% substitute
tax, to be paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Any decrease in value of the managed assets accrued at
the tax year-end may be carried forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the
four succeeding tax years. The Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains or losses realized within said
regime in its annual tax return.

Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital
gains on the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from the 26% CGT) if the Noteholder is
an Italian resident individual not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to
Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30,1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10, 1996 and the Notes
are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements
set forth under Italian tax law.

_Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

Any gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes will be treated as part of taxable business
income (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of net value of

483


-----

the production for IRAP purposes), if realized by an Italian company, a similar commercial entity (including the
Italian permanent establishment of non-resident entities to which the Notes are connected) or Italian resident
individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected.

_Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian real estate investment fund or an
Italian real estate SICAF will be subject neither to CGT nor to any income tax at the level of the real estate
investment fund or the Real Estate SICAF (see “Tax treatment of Interest—Real estate investment funds and real
_estate SICAFs”). However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income_
realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares.
Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment funds or real estate
SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax
transparency basis. Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which is a Fund, a SICAF (other than a real estate SICAF) or
a SICAV will not be subject to CGT but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end
of the relevant fiscal year. Such result will not be taxed at the level of the Fund, the SICAF or the SICAV, but
income realized by the unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or sale of the units/shares
may be subject to a withholding tax of 26%.

_Pension funds_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian pension fund (subject to the
regime provided for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) will be included in the
result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to 20% substitute tax.

Subject to certain conditions and requirements (including minimum holding period requirement) and
several limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment), income relating to the Notes
may be excluded from the taxble base of the substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account
(piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth under Italian tax law.

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

A 26% CGT on capital gains may be payable on capital gains realized on the sale or redemption of the
Notes by non-Italian resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively
connected, if the Notes are held in Italy.

However, under Article 23(1)(f)(2) of Decree No. 917, capital gains realized by non-resident Noteholders
from the sale or redemption of notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and traded on regulated markets in Italy
or abroad are not subject to the CGT, subject to the filing of required documentation in a timely fashion (in
particular, a self-declaration that the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes).

Capital gains realized by non-resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an
Italian resident issuer, even if the Notes are not traded on regulated markets, are not subject to the CGT, provided
that the beneficial owner is:

(a) a resident, for tax purposes, of a state or territory included in the White List; or

(b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements
which have entered into force in Italy; or

(c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a state
or territory included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own state
of establishment; or

(d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign
state.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must satisfy the same conditions set
forth above to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva in accordance with Decree 239 (see “—
_Tax Treatment of Interest”)._

484


-----

If none of the above conditions is met, capital gains realized by non-resident Noteholders from the sale
or the redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets may be subject
to the CGT at the current rate of 26%. However, Noteholders might benefit from an applicable tax treaty with
Italy, providing that capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the
State where the recipient is tax resident, subject to certain conditions to be satisfied.

Under these circumstances, if non-resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which
the Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject
to the risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation
on capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-residents Noteholders file in time with the authorized
financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from the
competent tax authorities of their country of residence.

The _risparmio amministrato_ regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-Italian
resident persons and entities holding Notes deposited with an Intermediary, but non-Italian resident Noteholders
retain the right to waive this regime.

**_Certain reporting obligations for Italian-resident Noteholders_**

Under Law Decree No. 167 of June 28, 1990, as subsequently amended and supplemented, Italian
resident individuals, non-business entities and non-business partnerships that are resident in Italy and, during the
tax year, hold investments abroad or have financial assets abroad (including possibly the Notes) must, in certain
circumstances, disclose these investments or financial assets to the Italian tax authorities in their income tax return
(or, in case the income tax return is not due, in a proper form that must be filed within the same time as prescribed
for the income tax return), regardless of the value of such assets (save for deposits or bank accounts having an
aggregate value not exceeding €15,000 threshold throughout the year, which per se do not require such disclosure).
The requirement applies also where the persons above, being not the direct holder of the financial assets, are the
beneficial owners thereof for the purposes of anti-money laundering legislation.

No disclosure requirements exist for investments and financial assets (including the Notes) under
management or administration entrusted to Italian resident intermediaries (Italian banks, SIMs, fiduciary
companies or other professional intermediaries) and for contracts concluded through their intervention, provided
that the cash flows and the income derived from such activities and contracts have been subjected to Italian
withholding or substitute tax by the same intermediaries.

**_Italian inheritance tax and gift tax_**

The transfer of Notes by reason of gift, donation or succession proceedings is subject to Italian gift and
inheritance tax as follows:

(a) 4% for transfers in favor of the spouse or direct relatives exceeding, for each
beneficiary, a threshold of €1.0 million;

(b) 6% for transfers in favor of siblings exceeding, for each beneficiary, a threshold of
€0.1 million;

(c) 6% for transfers in favor of relatives up to the fourth degree and to all relatives in law
in direct line and to other relatives in law up to the third degree, on the entire value of the inheritance or
the gift; and

(d) 8% for transfers in favor of any other person or entity, on the entire value of the
inheritance or the gift.

If the heir/heiress or the donee is a person with a severe disability pursuant to Law No. 104 of February
5, 1992, inheritance tax or gift tax is applied to the extent that the value of the inheritance or gift exceeds €1.5
million.

With respect to Notes listed on a regulated market, the value for inheritance and gift tax purposes is the
average stock exchange price of the last quarter preceding the date of the succession or of the gift (including any
accrued interest). With respect to unlisted Notes, the value for inheritance tax and gift tax purposes is generally
determined by reference to the value of listed debt securities having similar features or based on certain elements
as presented in the Italian tax law.

485


-----

Italian inheritance tax and gift tax applies to non-Italian resident individuals for bonds issued by Italian
resident companies.

The transfer of financial instruments as a result of death is exempt from inheritance tax when such
financial instruments are included in a long-term saving account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine)
that meets the requirements set forth under Italian tax law.

**_Wealth tax—direct holding_**

According to Article 19 of Law Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011, Italian resident individuals, noncommercial entities, including trusts and foundations and noncommercial partnerships holding financial products,
including the Notes, outside Italy without the involvement of an Italian financial intermediary are required to pay
a wealth tax currently at the rate of 0.2% (the level of tax being determined in proportion to the period of
ownership). The wealth tax applies on the market value at the end of the relevant year or, in the absence of a
market value, on the nominal value or redemption value of such financial products held outside Italy. Taxpayers
are generally permitted to deduct from the wealth tax a tax credit equal to any wealth taxes paid in the State where
the financial products are held (up to the amount of the Italian wealth tax due). The wealth tax cannot exceed
€14,000.00 per year for taxpayers different from individuals.

**_Stamp taxes and duties—holding through financial intermediary_**

Under Article 13(2bis-2ter) of Decree No. 642 of October 26, 1972, a 0.2% stamp duty generally applies
on communications and reports that Italian financial intermediaries periodically send to their clients in relation to
the financial products that are deposited with such intermediaries. The Notes are included in the definition of
financial products for these purposes. Communications and reports are deemed to be sent at least once a year even
if the Italian financial intermediary is under no obligation to either draft or send such communications and reports.

The stamp duty cannot exceed €14,000.00 for Noteholders other than individuals.

Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree issued by the Italian Ministry of Economy
and Finance on May 24, 2012, the 0.2% stamp duty does not apply to communications and reports that the Italian
financial intermediaries send to investors who do not qualify as “clients” according to the regulations issued by
the Bank of Italy. Communications and reports sent to this type of investors are subject to the ordinary €2.00
stamp duty for each copy.

The taxable base of the stamp duty is the market value or, in the lack thereof, the nominal value or the
redemption amount of any financial product.

**_Registration tax_**

Contracts relating to the transfer of the Notes are subject to the registration tax as follows:

(a) public deeds and private deeds with notarized signatures (atti pubblici e scritture
_private autenticate) are subject to fixed registration tax at rate of €200.00; and_

(b) private deeds (scritture private non autenticate) are subject to fixed registration tax of
€200.00 only in the case of use or voluntary registration or occurrence of the so-called enunciazione.

**_General—payments by a Guarantor_**

According to a certain interpretation, payments on the Notes made by an Italian resident Guarantor under
a Guarantee should be treated, in certain circumstances, as payment by the relevant Issuer and should be subject
to the tax regime described above. However, there is no authority directly regarding the Italian tax regime of
payments on notes made by an Italian resident guarantor. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Italian
tax authorities will not assert an alternative treatment of such payments or that the Italian courts would not support
such an alternative treatment.

In particular, according to a different interpretation, if a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of
interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of principal under the Notes),
it is possible that such payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, pursuant to Presidential
Decree No. 600 of September 29, 1973, subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any
applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may apply.

486


-----

**_Effect of an IPO Pushdown_**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under “Description
_of the Notes—IPO Pushdown” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—_
_Group Pushdown,” such change in the Issuer may have adverse tax consequences for the Italian and non-Italian_
resident holders of the Notes, as, among others, it may trigger the realization of a taxable capital gain.

The Italian and non-Italian resident holders of the Notes are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding
the Italian income tax consequences to them of the IPO Pushdown.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.
This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below). This
discussion does not address the impact of the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income or the effects
of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state,
local or non-U.S. tax laws. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are
expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will
not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the
Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to
a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial
institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S.
holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment
companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities (or investors in such entities),
persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion
transaction” or other integrated transaction and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any
item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In
addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issuance and at their
“issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money, not including sales to
bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents
or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.
Furthermore, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S.
holders that own Existing Notes that will be redeemed by the Issuer using the proceeds from the offering of the Notes,
and who also acquire Notes.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any
entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or
the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless
of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes,
the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. A holder that is a partnership,
and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of**
**holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income**

487


-----

**tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws, the**
**U.S. Federal Medicare tax on net investment income, and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.**

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts,”
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation
_Reasons,” and “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”), the Issuer may be obligated to redeem the Notes_
for an amount in excess of their adjusted issue price (plus accrued and unpaid interest), or may be obligated to
make certain payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and interest. Although the issue is not free from
doubt, the Issuer believes that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments due to the
possibility of such a redemption occurring or such excess payments being made. The Issuer’s position is binding
on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different
position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt
instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate different than their yield to maturity
and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note. The balance of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not
be considered contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding
the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences
thereof.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

In certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown, pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled
to give notice that will automatically operate so that, among other things, the references to the applicable Issuer
and Restricted Subsidiaries in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, any Parent
of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any security granted by any such Parent. Such
modifications to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed
exchange of the Notes for “new” Notes. In such event, U.S. holders generally would recognize any gain on such
exchange (although any loss could be disallowed), and the “new” Notes could be treated as issued with original
issue discount (“OID”), or a greater amount of OID, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the
determination of whether the deemed “new” Notes are treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a
result of the possibility of additional payments, as further described above under “—Characterization of the
_Notes,” would be made at the time of the modification. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors as to the_
U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to potential modifications of the Notes in connection with an IPO
Pushdown.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on a Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding
taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S.
holder as ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued in accordance with the U.S.
holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stated interest income generally will be
income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be
considered “passive category income.”

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will
recognize interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate of exchange
on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S.
holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may
recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign currency received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who
otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such
interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for
each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by
translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate of exchange in effect during the interest accrual
period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period
within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, such holder may make an election (which must be applied

488


-----

consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to
which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and cannot be changed without the consent
of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period
(or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate of exchange on the
date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Notes
that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency
exchange gain or loss, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar
value of such payment, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received, and the U.S.
dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss
will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.-source and generally will not be treated
as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible
for foreign tax credits (or, at such holder’s election, a deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). The calculation of
foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular
circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. holders
generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a
constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. As a result, U.S. holders will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash
attributable to such income.

The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount exceeds the issue price (as
defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025
multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date).

In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder
is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion
thereof in which such U.S. holder holds the Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any
“accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be
of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer
than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual
period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the
Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on
the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period,
over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the
start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual
period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all
principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the
Note. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest and
OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating
rate applicable to the Notes as of the issue date.

OID generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign
tax credit, generally will be considered “passive category income.”

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then
translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in the third
paragraph under “—Payments of Stated Interest.”

A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon
the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in
income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment
received, determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar
value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note
other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with
payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as receipts of principal. Exchange

489


-----

gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will
not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. The rules governing OID instruments are complex
and prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Notes
as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to the U.S. holder,
increased by any OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to such Note. The cost of a Note
purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date
of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on an established securities
market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of
the cost of the Note at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase.

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts
attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income in accordance
with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in
the Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an
amount of foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of that amount based on the spot rate on the
date of taxable disposition. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if
it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement
date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be
applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the
IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date,
and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and, with
respect to the principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S.
holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement
or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign
currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to
principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, accrued OID (which will be treated as
discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest,” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable) will be
recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement
or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the
United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on
the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or
loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the
time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of an individual U.S. holder, any
such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain
prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign
currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the
foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, payments of interest (including the accrual of OID, if any) and the proceeds from sales or
other dispositions (including retirements or redemptions) of Notes held by a U.S. holder may be required to be
reported to the IRS unless the U.S. holder is an exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrates this fact. In
addition, a U.S. holder that is not an exempt recipient may be subject to backup withholding unless it provides a
taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.

490


-----

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited
against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the
appropriate information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirement_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter
transactions cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency
transactions. Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including,
in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note or foreign currency
received in respect of a Note to the extent that any such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
results in a tax loss in excess of an applicable threshold amount. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to
determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement
to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

In addition, certain U.S. holders who are individuals and who hold an interest in “specified foreign
financial assets” (as defined in section 6038D of the Code) are required to report information to the IRS relating
to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts
maintained by certain financial institutions). Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual
for purposes of the foregoing rules. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of
the foreign disclosure requirements on their ownership and disposition of the Notes.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX
MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE
INVESTOR IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF
AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution.”

**ERISA Considerations**

Any purchaser, including, without limitation, any fiduciary purchasing on behalf of (i) an employee
benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”)) subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or a plan, individual retirement
account or other arrangement to which Section 4975 of the Code applies (each, a “Plan”), (ii) an entity whose
underlying assets include “plan assets” “(within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 as modified by
Section 3(42) of ERISA or any applicable Similar Laws (as defined below)) with respect to a Plan by reason of a
Plan’s investment in such entity or otherwise (each, a “Benefit Plan Investor”) or (iii) a governmental (as defined

state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the fiduciary responsibility or
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”),
transferee or holder of the Notes will be deemed to have represented, agreed and acknowledged (as applicable) in
its corporate and fiduciary capacity, that:

therein, (1) either (A) it is not, and it is not acting directly or indirectly on behalf of (and for so long as
it holds such Notes or any interest therein will not be, and will not be acting directly or indirectly on
behalf of), a Plan, a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan or other
arrangement that is subject to Similar Laws, and no part of the assets used or to be used by it to acquire
or hold such Notes or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any such Plan, Benefit Plan Investor

its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes or any interest therein does not and will not
constitute or otherwise result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I

of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan
or other arrangement, a violation of any applicable Similar Laws); and (ii) none of the Issuer, the
guarantors, the Initial Purchaser, the Trustee or other persons that provide marketing services, nor any of
their affiliates, has provided, and none of them will provide, impartial investment advice and they are
not giving any advice in a fiduciary capacity, in connection with the purchaser’s acquisition of Notes;
and (2) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such Notes or any interest therein other than to a purchaser
or transferee that is deemed (or if required by the applicable indenture, certified) to make these same
representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its acquisition, holding and disposition of
such Notes or any interest therein.

(b) The acquirer and any fiduciary causing it to acquire an interest in any Notes agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, the guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and/or their
respective affiliates, from and against any cost, damage or loss incurred by the Issuer, the Guarantors,
the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and/or any of their respective affiliates, as applicable, as a result of

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated
the date of this offering memorandum by and among the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers, we have agreed to sell
to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us,
together with all other Initial Purchasers, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of €295.0 million.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.
After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering prices and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to
time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Sales in the United States may be made through certain
affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer
intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered
broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in
whole or in part.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price
set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited
exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 45 days after the date
hereof, we will not, and the Guarantors will not, without the prior written consent provided for in the Purchase
Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the
Issuer or any of the Guarantors that are substantially similar to the Notes.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and
may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule
144A under the U.S. Securities Act and outside the United States to persons that are not U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted as
described under “Notice to Investors.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that:

- such Initial Purchaser has offered and sold the Securities, and will offer and sell the Securities, (A) as part of
such Initial Purchaser’s distribution at any time and (B) only in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A
or any other available exemption from registration under the Securities Act;

- no such Initial Purchaser nor any of its affiliates or any other person acting on its or their behalf has engaged
or will engage in any directed selling efforts with respect to the Securities, and all such persons have complied
and will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S;

- at or prior to the confirmation of sale of any Securities sold in reliance on Regulation S, such Initial Purchaser
will have sent to each distributor, dealer or other person receiving a selling concession, fee or other
remuneration that purchases Securities from it during the distribution compliance period a confirmation or
notice to substantially to the following effect: “The Securities covered hereby have not been registered under
the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may not be offered or sold within the
United States, except in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other available exemption from
registration under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S”;

- such Initial Purchaser has not and will not enter into any contractual arrangement with any distributor with
respect to the distribution of the Notes, except with its affiliates or with the prior written consent of the Issuer;

The securities described in the attached offering memorandum are not intended to be offered or sold to
and should not be offered or sold to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); (ii) a
customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a

-----

professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined
in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “EU Prospectus Regulation”). No key information document required by the
PRIIPs Regulation, for offering or selling any in scope instrument or otherwise making such instruments available
to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared. Offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State
of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the EU Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the EU
Prospectus Regulation.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of the EUWA or (ii)
a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA
to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore,
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful
under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us
or the Initial Purchaser that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly,
and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the
Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any
applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not
constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or
solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to
inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering
memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

We and Emil Holding II S.à r.l. have also agreed and the Guarantors (upon accession to the Purchase
Agreement) will agree that we will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of,
directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition
would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A
and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We have applied to list
the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and trade the Notes on the Euro MTF Market,
however, we cannot assure you that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any
market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchaser without
notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does
develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an active trading market
_for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be ten business days (as such term is used
for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement

498


-----

cycle is being referred to as “T + 10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary
market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the
next seven business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade
to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own
advisors.

In connection with the Offering, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (the “Stabilizing Manager”), or
persons acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of
the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes
in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf,
may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the
open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its
behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the
Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these
activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of,
or trading markets for, the Notes. “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—There may
_not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the
Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit
bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.
Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed
to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchaser to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or
dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction
to cover short positions.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or
after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may
be discontinued at any time.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may
currently and/or in the future perform, various financial advisory, investment and corporate banking, commercial
lending and banking, consulting and other commercial services in the ordinary course of business for us and our
affiliates, and may have from time to time in the past held, and may in the future hold, positions in our or any of
our affiliates’ securities or enter into hedging or general derivative transactions with us or our affiliates in the
ordinary course of business, for which they received or will receive customary fees and commissions and
reimbursement of expenses.

Affiliates of the Initial Purchasers are mandated lead arrangers and lenders under, and an affiliate of
UniCredit Bank AG acts as agent and security agent under, and will receive a portion of the proceeds of the
Offering in connection with the refinancing of, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. Furthermore, certain of the
Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates will be mandated lead arrangers and lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, which will be made available to us and certain of our subsidiaries on or about the Issue
Date. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are or may become parties to
certain of our hedging arrangements. In connection with their services in such capacities, the Initial Purchasers
(or their affiliates) have also received, or will receive, customary interest, fees and commissions.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts
of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve our or our affiliates’ securities and/or
instruments (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise). The Initial Purchasers and their

499


-----

respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research
views in respect of such securities or instruments and at any time may hold, or recommend to clients that they
acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

If any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us or our affiliates, certain
of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may routinely hedge their credit exposure to our or our affiliates in a
manner consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in our or our affiliates’ securities, including potentially the Notes
offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the
Notes offered hereby.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

The consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and for each
of the years then ended, included in this offering memorandum, have been audited by KPMG S.p.A., independent
auditors, as stated in their report, appearing herein, which includes an other matters paragraph which states the
three-year financial statements have been prepared for their inclusion in the offering memorandum drawn up as
part of the potential issue of notes.

With respect to the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, included herein, which includes an other matters paragraph which states the
condensed interim consolidated financial statements of Limacorporate Group as at and for the nine-month periods
ended 30 September 2022 and 30 September 2021 have been prepared for their inclusion in the offering
memorandum drawn up as part of the potential issue of notes, the independent auditors have reported that they
applied limited procedures in accordance with professional standards for a review of such information. However,
their separate report included herein, states that they did not audit and they do not express an opinion on that
condensed interim consolidated financial information.

Accordingly, the degree of reliance on their report on such information should be restricted in light of
the limited nature of the review procedures applied.

**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**

We are not currently subject to the periodic reporting and other information requirements of the
Exchange Act.

Each purchaser of the Notes from the Initial Purchasers will be furnished with a copy of this offering
memorandum and, to the extent provided to the Initial Purchasers by us for such purpose, any related amendment
or supplement to this offering memorandum. Each person receiving this offering memorandum acknowledges
that: (1) such person has been afforded an opportunity to request from us and to review, and has received, all
additional information considered by it to be necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information
herein; (2) such person has not relied on any of the Initial Purchasers or any person affiliated with any Initial
Purchaser in connection with its investigation of the accuracy of such information or its investment decision; and
(3) except as provided pursuant to (1) above, no person has been authorized to give any information or to make
any representation concerning the Notes or the Guarantees offered hereby other than those contained herein and,

remain outstanding and are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the U.S. Securities
Act, we will, during any period in which we are neither subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, nor
exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, upon written request of a holder or
beneficial owner of the Notes, furnish to such holder or beneficial owner or to the Trustee or any relevant paying
agent for delivery to such holder or beneficial owner or prospective purchaser of the Notes, as the case may be,
the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act, to permit
compliance with Rule 144A thereunder in connection with resales of the Notes. Any such request should be
directed to the Issuer at Via Nazionale 52, Villanova di San Daniele del Friuli (UD), Italy.

and to listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and the rules and regulations of such stock
exchange so require, copies of such information will also be available for review during the normal business hours
on any business day at the specified office of the Issuer during normal business hours on any weekday (excluding
holidays).

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

The Company is incorporated in Italy, and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, England and Wales, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and future
Guarantors may also be organized under the laws of other foreign jurisdictions. Most of our directors and
executive officers and many of the directors and officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States.
Although we and each of the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the
United States on our directors and executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors or
security providers. In addition, as many of our and the Guarantors’ assets and the assets of our and their directors
and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them or us
judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the Federal securities laws of the
United States.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us or a Guarantor, investors may need to enforce such
judgment in foreign jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets or where the relevant director or executive
resides. Enforcement of a U.S. judgment in foreign jurisdictions is subject to the procedural rules and law of that
jurisdiction, there being no treaties in force between the United States and any other jurisdictions with respect to
the enforcement of court judgments providing for direct or automatic enforceability of U.S. court judgments (as
opposed to international arbitration awards, which are subject to automatic recognition under the New York
Convention). Even though a description of the enforcement process for U.S. court judgments outside the United
States is generally described below for the countries in which our Guarantors or the Collateral are incorporated or
located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment
in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States. We cannot assure you that a U.S. court judgment will
be recognized and enforced in any foreign jurisdiction, including the jurisdictions outlined below.

**Italy**

**_Recognition and enforcement of U.S. judgments in Italy_**

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including judgments
obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, may
not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of
May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato) the following conditions are met:

    - the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law principles
of jurisdiction;

    - the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with
U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been violated;

    - the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event
of default by the defendant, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S. law;

    - the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law;

    - there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

    - there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which
commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

    - the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by a
U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a
proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of Italy to that end. The
competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of
all the conditions set out above.

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely
on the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian courts, Italian
courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law

504


-----

that are regarded as mandatory, and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought
(e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates any Italian public policies and/or any mandatory provisions
of Italian law.

**France**

**_Recognition and enforcement of U.S. judgments in France_**

One of the Guarantors is organized under the laws of France with its registered office or principal place
of business in France (the “French Guarantor”). The directors, officers and other executives of the French
Guarantor are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most
of the assets of the French Guarantor or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result,
it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce
against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state
securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process
within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law
claims connected with the Notes against French Guarantor and/or French Individuals.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a
judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon
U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur)
in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte)
proceedings if such U.S. Judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that
the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a
review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

(a) such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter
because the dispute is substantially connected to the jurisdiction of such court, the choice of the U.S.
court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter;

(b) such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both
pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights, and in this respect, it
should be noted that the scope and content of French international public policy are not precisely or
exhaustively defined under French law and are determined by French courts on a case-by-case basis and
may vary in time;

(c) such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law; and

(d) such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment
that has become effective in France. Where proceedings are pending before French courts at the time
enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and where these procedings have the same or similar subject
matter as such U.S. judgment, the courts may stay the exequatur proceedings.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the
res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in
France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected
under certain circumstances by French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80 538
of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of
documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign
authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in
connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities

505


-----

would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or
French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files
and individual liberties, as modified from time to time, including as most recently by French Law No. 2022-52 of
January 24, 2022 and, Regulation (EU) No. 2016-679 of April 27, 2016) can limit under certain circumstances
the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or
administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply all or part of
foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern
their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French international
public policy or (ii) in case of applicable overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by
French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws,
French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual)
can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by
the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French Individuals. Pursuant to
Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in
connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the
foreign claimant (Article 15). These provisions also apply in the context of non-contractual obligations. For a long
time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant,
could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according
to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been
commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of
jurisdiction is not fraudulent. More specifically, according to a recent case law, a French defendant can no longer
challenge the jurisdiction of a foreign tribunal on the basis of Article 15 of the French civil code in circumstances
where the foreign tribunal has otherwise jurisdiction. In addition, French and foreign claimants may respectively
waive their rights respectively to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code,
including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges
granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against
a person domiciled in an EU Member State.

Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article
14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s
nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU.

There are diverging positions amongst the chambers of the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation)
regarding the validity of a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and
giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction. On the one hand, further to
several decisions – the most recent dated October 3, 2018 – the first civil chamber of the French Supreme Court
(Cour de Cassation) seems to consider that, unless the competent courts can be identified by reference to objective
elements or jurisdiction rules in force in a Member State, unilateral jurisdiction clauses do not comply with the
objective of foreseeability set out in the international instruments applicable in these cases and are therefore
invalid. On the other hand, in a decision dated May 11, 2017, the commercial chamber of the French Supreme
Court (Cour de Cassation) held that a unilateral jurisdiction clause is valid. Accordingly, case-law regarding the
validity of unilateral jurisdiction clauses can be regarded as highly uncertain. Any provisions to the same effect
in any relevant documents may therefore not be binding over the party submitted court.

**Germany**

**_Recognition and enforcement of U.S. judgments in Germany_**

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of
civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an
action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic
of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments,

506


-----

other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore
may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely
upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment
by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court
of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original
matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final
under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in section
328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung) exist:

    - if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did
not have jurisdiction;

    - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense,
provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly;

    - if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign
court which is to be recognized in Germany;

    - if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with
a proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before the U.S.
federal or state court entered its judgment;

    - if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of
German law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights
(Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

    - if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a
comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, and after having received a recognition decision (Exequatur) from a competent
German court, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained
from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the effect that reciprocity of the
recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets (vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with
regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will
be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in
an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities laws.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts
as incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount
of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate
actual losses or damages.

Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S.
federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify
as being of a penal or punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far
as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common
law provided for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the
production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this
matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under German
law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in
Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under
such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons
will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates.

507


-----

A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment
rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of
process within Germany upon a German Guarantor or those persons under the Hague Convention on the Service
Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the
German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or
security, which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular
the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the
German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely
because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**The Netherlands**

**_Recognition and enforcement of U.S. judgments in the Netherlands_**

It may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against any Guarantor
incorporated under Dutch law.

The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. In the
absence of an applicable convention between the United States of America and the Netherlands, a judgment
rendered by a court in the United States of America will not be recognized and enforced by the Dutch courts.
However, if a person has obtained a final and conclusive judgment for the payment of money rendered against a
company by the foreign court which is enforceable in the U.S., and files his claim with the competent Dutch court,
the Dutch court will generally give binding effect to the foreign judgment insofar as it finds that the jurisdiction
of the foreign court has been based on grounds which are internationally acceptable and that proper legal
procedures have been observed, and unless the foreign judgment contravenes Dutch public policy or is
incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court or with an earlier judgment
rendered between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based
on the same cause, provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands.

Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed in EUR at the applicable
rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in the Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies
available in the courts of the Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay
proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought
elsewhere.

Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize
damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement and
recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in the Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions of the Dutch
Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering).

**Spain**

**_Recognition and enforcement of U.S. judgments in Spain_**

The description of Spanish law set forth below discusses the service of process on, and enforcement of
civil liabilities, against the Spanish Guarantors and us.

A final unappealable judgment obtained against Spanish companies outside of Spain (and, in particular,
in the United States), other than in a country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters (“EU Regulation 1215/2012”), would be recognized and enforced by
the Courts of Spain (unless such judgment contravenes principles of Spanish public policy rules) pursuant to the
following regimes:

- according to the provisions of any applicable treaty (there being none currently in existence between Spain
and the United States for these purposes); and

in the absence of any such treaty (which is the case between the United States and Spain), the judgment
would be enforced in Spain if it satisfies all of the following requirements in compliance with and subject to article

508


-----

523 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law and subject to Law 29/2015, of July 30, on International Legal
Cooperation in Civil Matters (Ley 29/2015, de 30 de julio, de Cooperación Jurídica Internacional en materia civil)
(the “Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters”) which repeals articles 951 to 958 of the
former Spanish Civil Procedure Law of 1881 (Real Decreto de Promulgación de 3 de febrero de 1881 de
Enjuiciamiento Civil):

###### (a) such judgment is final and conclusive (firme);

 (b) such judgment was rendered by a Court having jurisdiction over the matter since the dispute is clearly
connected to the relevant Court and the choice of the Court is not fraudulent;

###### (c) the judgment is not contrary to Spanish public policy rules (orden público) or mandatory provisions and
the obligation to be fulfilled is legal in Spain;

###### (d) the documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement is accompanied by a literal,
authentic, sworn Spanish translation;

###### (e) the copy of the judgment presented before the Spanish Court is duly apostilled;

 (f) there is not a pending previous proceeding between the same parties and in relation to the same issues in
Spain;

###### (g) there is not an incompatible judgment rendered in Spain or previously rendered in another country-when
this last judgment meets the requirements to be eventually recognized in Spain;

###### (h) where rendering the judgment, the Courts rendering it did not infringe an exclusive ground of jurisdiction
provided for under Spanish law or based their jurisdiction on exorbitant grounds and the choice of Court
is not fraudulent;

###### (i) that the foreign judgment meets the requirements provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Law if the issuer
is subject to insolvency proceedings in Spain;

###### (j) the rights of defense of the defendant were protected where rendering the judgment, including, but not
limited to, a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for the defendant to prepare its
defense and the foreign judgment was not rendered by default (i.e., without appearance or without the
possibility to appear for the defendant); and

###### (k) finally, although reciprocity is not a legal requirement, if it were proven that the foreign jurisdiction in
which the judgment was obtained does not recognize judgments issued by Spanish Courts on a general
basis, then the Spanish Courts could be compelled to deny the recognition of the foreign judgment in
Spain.

Any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain must file an application seeking
declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequátur) with the relevant Spanish Judge of First Instance
(Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil). Once a judgment has been
recognized under the exequátur proceedings, it will be enforceable in Spain in accordance with the Spanish Civil
Procedure Law in particular, it will be applicable the lapse of legal action (five years).

According to article 3.2 of Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters, the Spanish

Government may deny cooperation with other state’s authorities if there has been a repeated refusal of cooperation
or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation by such other state’s authorities provided that the Spanish
Government passes a Royal Decree for these purposes.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States of America could be adversely
affected under certain circumstances by Spanish law (relating to communication of documents and information
of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which
could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in Spain or from Spanish persons in connection with a judicial or
administrative U.S. action.

Furthermore, and according to article 47 of Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters,
there is a special provision and a special rule concerning the recognition of foreign judgments rendered in

509


-----

proceedings resulting from collective action, which may be enforced in Spain insofar as they satisfy the conditions
set forth therein.

The Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters expressly prohibits that a foreign judgment
is reviewed as to its substance (revisión del fondo) by the competent Spanish Court.

The Spanish Courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount
due and payable by the issuer or the Spanish Guarantors, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and
interest will be paid in euros. Any judgment obtained against the issuer or any of the Spanish Guarantors in any
country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 would be recognized and enforced in accordance
with the terms set forth thereby.

The enforcement of any judgment in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs:
(a) translation fees for documents in a language other than Spanish, which must be accompanied by a sworn
translation into Spanish; (b) foreign documents may be required to be legalized and apostilled; (c) certain
professional fees for the verification of the legal representative of a party litigating in Spain, if needed; (d) judicial
tax and fees; (e) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney at law and the
party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); and (f) the content and validity of foreign law must be
evidenced to the Spanish Courts (which could, again, entail certain costs). In addition, it should be noted that
Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will therefore prevail
notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes.

As an alternative to the exequatur proceedings, the parties might agree to bring the original action to
Spain, so that the dispute is settled by Spanish Courts. Pursuant to Article 54 of the current Spanish Civil
Procedure Law, the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly agree to the submittal to one Judge (Juzgado)
or Court (Tribunal) (provided that under the Spanish Civil Procedure Law and the Spanish Judicial Law (Ley
_Orgánica 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, del Poder Judicial) the relevant Judge or Court is competent to solve the_
corresponding dispute); this article does not expressly cover the validity of nonexclusive jurisdiction clauses, at
least for conflicts between different Spanish Courts. If an original action is brought in Spain, the choice of law
made by the parties may be rejected by Spanish Courts on grounds that it contravenes Spanish public policy rules
(orden público).

**England and Wales**

**_Recognition and enforcement of U.S. judgments in England and Wales_**

A final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil
liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, is not automatically recognized or
enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, proceedings
must first be initiated at common law before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an
action, the English or the Welsh court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided
by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary
judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by
which the courts of England and Wales can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full trial.
Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English and Welsh court in such an action is conditional
upon (among others) the following:

    - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original
proceedings according to English rules of private international law (in other words, it does not matter
that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law or that the debtor appeared before a U.S.
court, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international
law);

    - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable
in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and

    - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature
or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English or a Welsh court
considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law.

510


-----

An English or a Welsh court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the
court that:

    - the U.S. judgment contravenes English or Welsh public policy or the European Convention on
Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to
the extent applicable);

    - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed
as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of
State under Section 1 of the Act;

    - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or
substantial justice;

    - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English or Welsh court or
another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales or conflicts with an
earlier judgment of such court;

    - the English or Welsh enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation
period; or

    - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the resolution of disputes under which
the dispute in question was to be resolved otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to
whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit).

Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales that
have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, we cannot assure you
whether an English or Welsh court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was
commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws. The foregoing assumes that such enforcement action takes place outside of any bankruptcy or insolvency
process: it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the
judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or
counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment
debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in
England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.

**Australia**

**_Recognition and enforcement of U.S. judgments in Australia_**

While the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth) makes provision for the enforcement of certain overseas
judgments in Australia, that Act does not apply to United States judgments.

In Australia, in order to enforce without a re-examination of the merits of the issues determined by the
proceedings, any final and conclusive judgment against Lima Australia in a New York court arising out of or in
relation to the obligations of Lima Australia under the Guarantee, which judgment is for a fixed sum of money
(and not being a sum in respect of taxes or in respect of a fine or other penalty) certain conditions must be met,
including (but not limited to) the following:

    - in order for the Australian Court to enforce such a judgment, the party seeking the enforcement must
bring a fresh action in an appropriate Court in Australia to enforce the foreign judgment;

    - the New York court must have been jurisdictionally competent in hearing and determining the
issue(s) concerned in the judgment under the rules of private international law of Australia. In order
to have jurisdiction, the defendant must be shown to be ordinarily resident or have a presence in the
foreign jurisdiction, or to have submitted to the jurisdiction by defending the action in the New York
court;

511


-----

    - the parties to the proceedings of the New York court and to the enforcement proceedings must be
identical;

    - the judgment of the New York Court must be final and conclusive;

    - the proceedings in the New York court must not have involved any denial of the principles of natural
justice and procedural fairness recognized by the Australian Courts;

    - the judgment must not be contrary to the public policy of the laws of Australia or the law of public
policy of the State of New York;

    - there must not have been a prior judgment in another court between the same parties concerning the
same issues as are dealt with in the judgment in the New York court;

    - the judgment must not be obtained by fraud or duress or a trick or be based on a clear mistake of
fact;

    - the enforcement proceeding must have been commenced within any applicable limitation periods
and any procedural rules including in relation to jurisdiction and service of process for
commencement and maintenance of proceedings before the New York court must have been
observed; and

    - the judgment must not be wholly satisfied (and enforcement must only be sought to the extent the
judgment is not satisfied).

**New Zealand**

**_Recognition and enforcement of U.S. judgments in New Zealand_**

Recognition, acceptance and enforcement by a New Zealand court of a judgment of a New York court
against Lima New Zealand in an action arising out of the Guarantee (governed by New Zealand law), without any
re-trial or re-examination of the merits of the action, would depend upon:

      - the relevant court having jurisdiction in accordance with the rules of private international law
applied in New Zealand;

      - the judgment of the relevant court being:

`o` final and conclusive;

`o` for a debt or a sum of money;

`o` not in respect of taxes or penalties;

`o` not obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to natural justice; and

`o` not repugnant to public policy as then recognized in New Zealand; and

###### • service of process in relation to the proceedings in that court having being properly effected in
accordance with New Zealand law.

Subsidiaries are those companies over which the group has control, as defined by IFRS 10 Consolidated financial
statements. Control exists when the group has the power to, directly or indirectly, govern the financial and operating policies
of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated financial statements starting from when control is assumed and until such control ceases to exist.

Subsidiaries are included in the consolidation scope from when the group acquires control, as defined above, and are
excluded from when the group no longer has control.

Lima (Beijing) Medical Devices Co. Ltd. incorporated under Chinese law in December 2020 was included in the
consolidated scope in 2021. It had not been consolidated in 2020 as it only began operations in 2021.

The Mississauga-based Lima Orthopaedics Canada Inc. was incorporated under Canadian law in October 2021. It is fully
owned by Limacorporate S.p.A.. As the company has begun operations during the half of 2022 and considering its
immateriality, the group decided not to consolidate it.

The interim reporting date of all of the consolidated companies is 30 September.

The basis of consolidation is set out below:
###### - The line-by-line method, showing the portions of equity and profit or loss for the year attributable to non-controlling
interests and recognising assets, liabilities, revenue and costs regardless of the percentage held in the
subsidiaries.
###### - Eliminating items deriving from intragroup transactions involving consolidated companies, including any
unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions and recognising the resulting deferred tax effects.

###### - Eliminating intragroup dividends and reallocating them to opening equity reserves.

 - Eliminating the carrying amount of investments in consolidated companies and the relevant portion of equity,
allocating the resulting positive and negative differences to the relevant captions (assets, liabilities and equity),
as defined at the time of acquisition of the investment and considering any subsequent variations. After control is
acquired, any acquisitions of non-controlling interests or sales of shares to non-controlling interests that do not
entail loss of control are recognised as owner transactions and the relevant effects are taken directly to equity.
Any differences between the change in equity attributable to non-controlling interests and cash and cash
equivalents exchanged are recognised under changes in equity attributable to the owners of the parent.

###### - The financial statements of foreign operations are translated into Euros using the annual average rate for income
statement items and the closing rate for statement of financial position items. The difference between the two
rates along with the translation differences deriving from changes in opening and closing exchange rates are

recognised as changes in equity.


-----

The following rates were applied in translating the financial statements of foreign operations:

**[2.4] Basis of presentation**

**[2.4.1] Business combinations and goodwill**

Business combinations are recognised using the acquisition method under IFRS 3. To this end, the acquired identifiable
assets and the assumed liabilities are recognised at their respective acquisition-date fair value. The consideration
transferred in a business combination is the aggregate of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets acquired,
assumed liabilities and equity instruments issued by the acquirer, in exchange for control of the acquiree.

Goodwill is the positive difference between the consideration transferred, increased by both the fair value at the acquisition
date of any non-controlling interests already held in the acquiree and the amount of non-controlling interests held in the
acquiree by third parties (measured at fair value or based on the present value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets),
and the fair value of such assets and liabilities.

At the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to the single cash-generating unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies

of the business combination.

If the difference between the consideration transferred (increased by the above components) and the fair value of the net
assets acquired is negative, this is recognised as a gain from a bargain purchase in the income statement in the year of
acquisition.

Any goodwill related to non-controlling interests is included in the carrying amount of the relevant equity investments.

After initial recognition, goodwill is not amortised and is recognised net of any cumulative impairment losses, calculated
using the methods set out in section [2.4.6] Impairment losses on assets. As set out in section [3.2] of this report, the
market multiples method is used to determine the recoverability of goodwill, using listed comparable companies. These

multiples are compared with the implicit multiple calculated using the group’s actual figures.

IFRS 3 is not applied retrospectively to business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2018, i.e., the date of the
parent’s transition to the IFRS. Accordingly, the amount of goodwill determined under the previous reporting standards,
i.e., the carrying amount at such date, is maintained for such business combinations, subject to the recognition of any
impairment losses.


-----

**[2.4.2] Intangible assets**

An intangible asset is an identifiable asset without physical substance, controlled by the group and that generates future
economic benefits, in addition to goodwill when acquired against consideration.

Identifiability is defined with reference to the possibility of distinguishing the intangible asset acquired from goodwill. An
intangible asset is identifiable when it: (i) arises from a legal or contractual right or (ii) is separable, i.e., can be sold,
transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or together with a related contract. An entity controls an
asset if it has the power to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource and to restrict the
access of others to such benefits.

Intangible assets are stated at cost, which is determined in same manner as for property, plant and equipment.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over their estimated useful lives starting from when they are available

for use.

The amortisation rates adopted in 2020, 2021 and 2022 are shown in the following table by asset category:

**2022 - 2021 - 2020 (*)**

Start-up and capital costs 3 - 4 - 5 years
Development expenditure 5-10 years
Patents and intellectual property rights 10 - 20 years
Licences, trademarks and similar rights 3 - 5 years
Other Contract term/ maximum 6 years

_* There were no changes to the amortisation rates_

_Development expenditure_

Development expenditure is expensed when incurred.

Development expenditure incurred for a specific project is only capitalised when the group can demonstrate the technical
feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use and for sale, its intention to complete such
asset and use or sell it, how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits, the availability of
adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and its ability to measure reliably the

expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

Subsequent to initial recognition, development expenditure is measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and
any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset starts from when the development phase has been
completed and the asset is available for use. The asset is amortised over the period for which the underlying project is
expected to generate revenue for the group.

_Patents and intellectual property rights_

Patents and intellectual property rights refer to costs for patents owned by Limacorporate S.p.A.

_Licences, trademarks and similar rights_

This caption refers to costs to file and register trademarks and costs incurred to acquire commercial licences. The
acquisition costs are amortised over a period equal to the useful life of the acquired right.

_Other intangible assets_

This caption refers to leasehold improvements carried out in prior years. The capitalised costs are amortised on the basis
of the residual term of the relevant lease contract.

|Col1|2022 - 2021 - 2020 (*)|
|---|---|
|Start-up and capital costs|3 - 4 - 5 years|
|Development expenditure|5-10 years|
|Patents and intellectual property rights|10 - 20 years|
|Licences, trademarks and similar rights|3 - 5 years|
|Other|Contract term/ maximum 6 years|


-----

**[2.4.3] Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recognised at acquisition or production cost including directly attributable costs incurred
to ready the asset for its intended use. Such cost includes costs to replace parts of equipment and plant when they are
incurred if they meet the recognition requirements.

Assets acquired under business combinations before 1 January 2018 (the date of the parent’s transition to the IFRS) are
recognised at their pre-existing carrying amount, determined within such business combinations in accordance with the
previous reporting standards, i.e., at deemed cost.

The carrying amount (cost less accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment losses) of the replaced parts of
equipment and plant is taken to profit or loss at the time of replacement.

Maintenance and repair costs, which do not add to the value of the assets and/or prolong their residual useful lives, are

expensed when incurred. Otherwise they are capitalised.

Property, plant and equipment are stated net of any accumulated depreciation and any cumulative impairment losses
determined using the methods set out below. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
life of the asset for the group.

The depreciation rates used are shown in the following table by asset category:

**2022** **2021**
Buildings 3% 3%
Light constructions 10% 10%
Generic and specific plant 10% - 15.5% 10% - 15.5%
Machinery 15.50% 15,50%
Sundry and small equipment 25% 25%
Production equipment 10% 10%
Office furniture and machines 12% 12%
Electronic office machines 20% 20%
Transport vehicles 20% 20%
Cars 25% 25%
Right-of-use assets Lease term Lease term

The residual value of the assets, the useful life and the depreciation method applied are reviewed at each periods end and
adjusted prospectively if necessary.
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, such parts are recognised
separately. Land, free of construction or annexed to buildings, is recognised separately and is not depreciated since it
has an unlimited useful life.
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment and every significant part initially recognised is
eliminated on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising
from the derecognition of the item (calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the net
disposal proceeds) is included in profit or loss when the item is derecognised.

**[2.4.4] Leases**

If a contract contains a lease, at the commencement date, the lessee shall recognise an asset representing its right to use
the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The lessee shall
recognise interest on the lease liability and depreciation of the right-of-use asset separately. At inception of a contract, the
entity shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right
to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

**[2.4.5] Equity investments**

Investments in associates are measured using the equity method, recognising the group’s share of the profits or losses for
the period in the income statement, with the exception of the effects related to other changes in the equity of the investee,
other than owner transactions, that are directly recognised in other comprehensive income.

|Col1|2022|2021|
|---|---|---|
|Buildings|3%|3%|
|Light constructions|10%|10%|
|Generic and specific plant|10% - 15.5%|10% - 15.5%|
|Machinery|15.50%|15,50%|
|Sundry and small equipment|25%|25%|
|Production equipment|10%|10%|
|Office furniture and machines|12%|12%|
|Electronic office machines|20%|20%|

-----

In the event of losses exceeding the carrying amount of the equity investment, the excess is recognised in a specific
provision to the extent the parent is obliged to fulfil legal or constructive obligations to the investee or to cover its losses.

Investments in other companies are measured at fair value and the fair value gains and losses are taken to equity. If fair
value cannot be reliably determined, they are measured at cost, adjusted for any impairment losses.

**[2.4.6] Impairment losses**

At the reporting date, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, financial assets and equity
investments is tested for indicators of impairment. Should such indicators exist, the group estimates the recoverable
amount of the asset to check the recoverability of the carrying amount and determine any impairment loss to be recognised.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually,
irrespective of whether any indication of impairment exists, or more frequently if an indication of impairment exists.

In order to identify impairment losses, assets are grouped into the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (the cash-generating unit,
CGU). Reference should be made to section [3.2] Goodwill for details of the group’s CGU. The goodwill generated by
business combinations is allocated to the CGU that is expected to benefit from the combinations’ synergies. The
recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.

The market multiples method is used to determine the value in use using listed comparable companies. These multiples
are compared with the implicit multiple calculated using the group’s actual figures. When the carrying amount of an asset

or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the group recognises an impairment loss in profit or loss. Impairment losses on
the CGU are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to it and then to the other assets of the
CGU pro rata on the basis of their carrying amounts. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed. Impairment losses
on other assets are reversed to the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation and
depreciation) had no impairment losses been recognised in prior periods.

**[2.4.7] Financial instruments**

The financial instruments held by the group are described below.

Financial assets

Financial assets include equity investments, loans and borrowings, as well as derivatives with a positive fair value, trade
receivables and other assets, in addition to cash and cash equivalents.

Specifically, cash and cash equivalents include cash, bank deposits and highly marketable securities that are readily
convertible to cash and are subject to an immaterial risk of changes in value.

Financial assets represented by debt instruments are classified in the consolidated financial statements and measured
using the business model adopted by the group for managing financial assets and based on the cash flows related to each
financial asset. Financial assets also include equity investments not held for trading. Such assets are strategic investments,
and the group has opted to recognise fair value gains or losses thereon through profit or loss (fair value through profit or
loss, FVTPL).

Financial assets are tested for impairment using a model based on expected credit losses.

_Financial liabilities_

Financial liabilities include loans and borrowings, as well as derivatives with a negative fair value, trade payables and other
liabilities.

Financial liabilities are classified and measured at amortised cost, with the exception of those initially measured at fair
value, e.g., financial liabilities related to considerations for business combinations and derivatives and financial liabilities
for options on non-controlling interests.

Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities


-----

A financial asset or liability (or, where applicable, part of a financial asset/liability or part of a group of similar financial
assets/liabilities) is derecognised when the group unconditionally transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows
of the financial asset or the obligation to make payments or fulfil other obligations related to the liability.

Derivatives and hedging transactions

Derivatives are solely used for hedging purposes, in order to reduce interest rate risk. They are recognised using hedge
accounting only when, at inception, the derivative is designated as a hedge. All derivatives are measured at fair value.

If hedge accounting cannot be applied, fair value gains or losses on the derivative are taken to profit or loss.

**[2.4.8] Inventories**

Raw materials and packaging are measured at the lower of purchase cost and estimated replacement value based on
market trends. The cost is calculated using the weighted average cost for the period.

Semi-finished products and finished goods are measured at purchase or production cost, considering their stage of
completion, or their realisable value based on market trends, if lower. The production cost includes the reasonably
attributable portion of direct and indirect manufacturing costs.

The resulting amount is written down through the allowance for inventory write-down to account for items whose expected
realisable value is lower than their cost.

**[2.4.9] Trade receivables and other assets and trade payables and other liabilities**

Trade receivables and other assets that derive from the supply of credit facilities, goods or services to third parties are
classified under current assets, except when they are due after one year of the reporting date with reference to loans and

receivables. If they have a set due date, current and non-current loans and receivables, other current and non-current
assets and trade receivables, with the exception of derivatives, are measured at amortised cost calculated using the
effective interest method. If they do not have a set due date, financial assets are measured at cost. Loans and receivables
due after one year that are non-interest bearing or accruing interest lower than market rates are discounted using market
rates.

The above financial assets are measured using the expected credit loss impairment model introduced by IFRS 9.

Trade payables and other liabilities that arise from the acquisition of credit facilities, goods or services from a third part
supplier are classified under current liabilities, except when they are due after one year of the reporting date with reference
to loans and borrowings.

On initial recognition, current and non-current loans and borrowings, other current and non-current liabilities and trade
payables are stated at fair value, which normally coincides with the transaction price including transaction costs.
Subsequently, with the exception of derivatives, all financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost calculated using the
effective interest method. Hedged financial liabilities are measured in accordance with hedge accounting.

**[2.4.10] Employee benefits**

The liability related to short-term employee benefits paid during the employment relationship is recognised on an accruals
basis at the amount accrued at the reporting date.

The liability related to employee benefits paid upon or after termination of the employment relationship via defined benefit
plans, is recognised at the amount accrued at the reporting date.

The liability related to employee benefits paid upon or after termination of the employment relationship via defined benefit
plans, net of any plan assets and advances granted, is calculated using actuarial assumptions and recognised on an
accruals basis in line with the service needed to obtain the benefits. Such liability is calculated by independent actuaries.
The gain or loss deriving from the actuarial calculation is fully recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.

Defined benefit plan liabilities are measured using the actuarial assumptions set out in section [3.14] Employee benefits.


-----

**[2.4.11] Provisions for risks and charges**

The provisions for risks and charges are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation or
transfer it to third parties at the reporting date. Where the effect of the discounting is material, the provisions are calculated
by discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money. When discounting is used, the carrying amount of the provision increases to reflect the passage of time and this

increase is recognised as borrowing cost.

**[2.4.12] Share-based payments**

The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements granted to employees is generally
recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market
performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of
awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment
awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such
conditions. With regard to non-vesting conditions, any differences between expected and actual outcomes do not have an
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of cash-settled share-based payments is recognised as an
expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value
of the share-based payments. Any fair value gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss.

The parent has agreements with some managers for the award of options and/or shares (see section [4.7] Incentive plans).

**[2.4.13] Revenue and expense**

Based on the five-step model introduced by IFRS 15, the group recognises revenue after identifying the contract(s) with a
customer and the performance obligations in the contract (transfer of goods and/or services), determining the transaction
price to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for fulfilling performance obligations (at a point in time or over time).

Revenue is measured on the basis of the transaction price excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Based
on the group’s internal analysis of contracts with customers, the group has not identified any performance obligations that
are satisfied over time and, therefore, the group recognises revenue upon the transfer of control of the promised goods or
services to the customer. Revenue is measured to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
group and the amount can be measured reliably.

Revenue is adjusted for any discounts and volume rebates allowed by the group in contracts with customers.

Expense is recognised when the goods and services are sold or consumed during the period or by systematic allocation,
or when it is not possible to identify their future use.

Expense items are classified by nature in accordance with the applicable IFRS.

**[2.4.14] Government grants**

Grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received.

Grants related to income are taken to profit or loss in the period in which the relevant expense is recognised.

Grants related to assets received for projects and development activities are recognised under liabilities and subsequently
recognised under operating revenue in line with the amortisation and depreciation of the relevant assets.


-----

Grants due for investments in research and development are recognised in line with the progress of the research,
calculated on the basis of the progress reports issued to the relevant bodies and the stage of completion reported by those
in charge of the research, if all requirements for their disbursement are met.

**[2.4.15] Financial income and expense**

Financial income and expense are recognised on the basis of interest accrued on the net amount of the relevant financial
assets and liabilities, using the effective interest method.

**[2.4.16] Dividends**

Dividends are recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established.

**[2.4.17] Income taxes**

Income taxes recognised in profit or loss are the sum of current and deferred taxes.

Income taxes for the period are determined on the basis of ruling legislation. They are recognised in profit or loss, except
for those related to items recognised directly in equity, for which the tax effect is accounted for directly in equity.

Income tax payables are recognised under current tax liabilities, net of advances paid. Any tax credits are recognised
under current tax assets.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities (resulting from the application of the accounting policies set out in note 4 “Basis of presentation”) and their tax
bases (deriving from the application of the tax legislation ruling in the country of the subsidiaries). Current and deferred tax
assets and liabilities are offset when the group has the legally enforceable right to offset.

Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates expected to be enacted in the periods in which the temporary differences
will be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Deferred tax assets are recognised on temporary differences and to the extent that it is probable the group will have future
taxable profits that will allow their recovery.

**[2.4.18] Fair value**

IFRS 13 is a common framework for fair value measurement and relevant disclosure when this measurement is required
or allowed by other IFRS. Specifically, the standard sets out the definition of fair value as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

IFRS 13 establishes a hierarchy that categorises the inputs used in the valuation techniques adopted to measure fair value
into different levels, as follows:

- level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access

at the measurement date;

- level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly
or indirectly;

- level 3: inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised within different
levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level
of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

The group recognises transfers among the different levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the periods in which the
transfer took place.


-----

Reference should be made to the notes to the individual financial statements’ items for the definition of the fair value
hierarchy level used to classify the individual instruments measured at fair value or whose fair value is disclosed.

The fair value of derivatives is calculated by discounting estimated cash flows using the market interest rates at the
reporting date and the credit default swaps issued by the counterparty and group companies, to include the nonperformance risk explicitly provided for under IFRS 13.

Where market prices are not available, the fair value of non-derivative medium/long-term financial instruments is calculated
by discounting estimated cash flows using the market interest rates at the reporting date and considering counterparty risk
for financial assets and credit risk for financial liabilities.

**[2.4.19] Use of estimates**

In preparing the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the directors were required to apply accounting
policies that are, at times, based on judgements or past experience or assumptions deemed reasonable and realistic at
the time, depending on the relevant circumstances. The application of such estimates and assumptions impacts the
carrying amounts recognised in the statement of financial position, income statement, statement of comprehensive income
and statement of cash flows, in addition to the disclosure provided. The end results of the assessments in which such
estimates and assumptions were used may differ from those recognised in the consolidated financial statements due to
the inherent uncertainty of the assumptions and the conditions underlying the estimates.

Actual results may differ from those estimated. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The effect

of a change in accounting estimates is recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change, if the change affects that
period only, or the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both.

Estimates mainly refer to the following captions:

###### - impairment losses on non-current assets and goodwill; - loss allowance; - allowance for inventory write-down; - recoverability of deferred tax assets; - estimate of the provisions for risks and contingent liabilities; - financial liabilities; - employee incentive plans.

_Impairment losses on non-current assets and goodwill_

Non-current assets include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets including goodwill and other financial assets.

Management periodically revises the carrying amount of non-current assets held and used and assets held for sale when
events and circumstances require such revision. This is performed using the estimates of cash flows the group expects to
derive from using or selling the asset and suitable discount rates for calculating the present value.

When the carrying amount of a non-current asset has been impaired, the group recognises an impairment loss equal to
the excess between the carrying amount and the amount to be recovered through use or sale of the asset, determined
using the parent’s or group’s most recent plans. Reference should be made to note [4.4] Impairment losses.

_Loss allowance_

The loss allowance is management’s best estimate of the potential credit losses on trade receivables from end customers.
Reference should be made to note 4.8 Trade receivables and other assets and trade payables and other liabilities for a
description of the criteria used in estimating the allowance.


-----

_Allowance for inventory write-down_

Inventories of slow-moving raw materials and finished goods are periodically analysed on the basis of historical data and
the possibility of selling them at prices lower than normal market transactions. If, as a result, the carrying amount of
inventories needs to be written down, the group recognises a specific allowance for inventory write-down.

_Recoverability of deferred tax assets_

The group pays taxes in numerous countries and some estimates are required to calculate the taxes in each jurisdiction.
It recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available and over a
period of time compatible with the time horizon implicit in the management estimates.

_Estimate of the provisions for risks and contingent liabilities_

The group could be subject to legal and tax disputes regarding a vast range of issues that are subject to the jurisdiction of
various countries. Disputes and litigation against the group are subject to a different degree of uncertainty, including the
facts and circumstances inherent to each dispute, the jurisdiction and different applicable laws. In the ordinary course of

business, management consults its legal consultants and legal and tax experts. The group recognises a liability for such
disputes when it is deemed probable that they will result in an outflow of resources and when the amount of the resulting
losses can be reasonably estimated. If an outflow of resources is possible but the amount cannot be determined, such fact
is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

_Employee incentive plans and financial liabilities_

Reference is made to section [4.7] for a description of the calculation of the fair value of share-based payments as part of
group management incentive plans.

Section [3.15] provides details of the calculation of fair value of the group’s financial liabilities.

**[2.4.20] Translation of foreign currency items**

The financial statements of each consolidated company are prepared using the functional currency related to the economy
where each company operates. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised at the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are subsequently translated
at the closing rate and any exchange differences are taken to profit or loss. Foreign currency non-monetary assets and
liabilities recognised at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

For consolidation purposes, the foreign currency financial statements prepared for consolidation purposes of the
consolidated companies are translated using the closing rates for asset and liability captions, including goodwill and
consolidation adjustments, and the average rate for the period (if similar to the respective transaction-date rates) or the
period under consolidation, if lower, for income statement captions. The relevant exchange differences are taken directly
to the statement of comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss when control over the investee is lost and, thus,

it is deconsolidated.

**[2.4.21] Operating segments**
An operating segment is a component of an entity:
###### - that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses (including revenue and
expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity);
###### - whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and
###### - for which discrete financial information is available.

Note [4.1] provides information about the single operating segment identified.

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life only comprise goodwill, while the other assets (development expenditure,
industrial patents and intellectual property, concessions, licences, trademarks and similar rights, other intangible assets

and assets under development and payments on account) all have a finite life. More information on each item is provided
below.

Development expenditure, amounting to €40,929 thousand, €33,882 thousand, €32,235 thousand and €664 thousand at
30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively.

The amount is mainly related to:

###### — An amount incurred by the parent and mostly refers to the Physica and Hybrid Glenoid (from 2020) products; — Intangible asset identified during PPA related to the allocation of part of the consideration transferred at the acquisition
date for TechMah Medical LLC (consolidated at 100% as per the anticipated acquisition method);
###### — TechMah Business combination generated a goodwill and the recognition of intangible assets allocated to
development expenditure based on an assessment carried out by an independent expert. The relevant estimated
useful life is ten years (from 2021);
###### — Costs capitalised by TechMah Medical LLC for the development of its products which will enrich the group’s portfolio
with digital solutions designed to assist surgeons with operations. The same applies as for the previous point regarding
amortisation (from 2021).

30.09.2022 vs 31.12 2021:

The significant increase during the nine-month of 2022 is due to expenditure related to TechMah Medical LLC.

Industrial patents and intellectual property rights, amounting to € 2,072 thousand, €2,063 thousand, €1,249 thousand and
€1,181 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively,
are comprised of costs incurred by Limacorporate S.p.A. to acquire patents in nine-month of 2022 and previous period.

Concessions, licences, trademarks and similar rights amounting to €5,084 thousand, €6,245 thousand, €4,997 thousand
and €5,016 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020,


-----

respectively. The amount is mainly referred to the parent cost to register Lima products on the European, US, Chinese,
Korean and Japanese markets.

Assets under development and payments on accounts, amounting to €11,984 thousand, €11,176 thousand, €11,638
thousand and €37,267 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020,
respectively.

30.09.2021 vs 31.12 2020:

The significant decrease during the nine-month of 2021 is due to the reclassification from assets under development of
development expenditure related to TechMah Medical LLC and costs incurred by the latter in 2021 to develop products.

“Other”, amounting to €581 thousand, €229 thousand, €268 thousand and €348 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31
December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively, mainly refers to Limacorporate S.p.a, Lima
USA, Lima Orthopaedics Australia and Lima Implantes.

Total amortisation of intangible assets taken to profit or loss amounts to:

###### - €6,244 thousand at 30 September 2022; - €4,811 thousand at 30 September 2021.

**[3.2] Goodwill**

Goodwill amounts to €400,536 thousand, €398,305 thousand, €397,925 thousand and €396,900 thousand at 30
September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively.

It arose on the following transactions:

   - the reverse merger between Limacorporate S.p.A. and Emil Holding III S.p.A. in 2016 (€376,604 thousand at 31
December 2021 and 2020 and 30 September 2022 and 2021);
   - the consolidation of TechMah Medical LLC at the acquisition date (5 September 2018); as explained above part
of the goodwill was recognised (€16,321 thousand, €14,047 thousand, €13,740 thousand and €12,965 thousand
at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively);
   - the acquisition and subsequent merger of Xpert Orthopaedics Ltd by Lima Orthopaedics UK (€2,735 thousand,
€2,874 thousand, €2,806 thousand and €2,686 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30
September 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively);
   - the acquisition of a business unit by Lima Korea (€312 thousand; €324 thousand, €318 thousand and €327
thousand and €337 at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020,
respectively);
   - the acquisition of the Gemes S.r.l. business unit by Limacorporate S.p.A. (€750 thousand, €642 thousand, €642
thousand and €503 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December
2020, respectively);
   - the goodwill granted by the parent to the previous distributor in Sicily to replace it as direct distributor on such
market following the business unit acquisition agreement signed on 25 September 2017 (€3,815 thousand, at 30
September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September and 31 December 2020).

Pursuant to IAS 36, goodwill is not subject to amortisation, but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently
if events or circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. With regard to testing goodwill for impairment, the group
identified a single operating CGU for its operations. It considered the sources of information set out by IAS 36 such as the
fact that management monitors the group’s performance and takes strategic decisions about its product offering and
investments at group level.

The goodwill recognised in Limacorporate condensed consolidated interim financial statements in relation to the abovementioned merger, together with other items of goodwill, was tested for impairment as at 31 December 2021 and 2020
and at 30 June 2022. Specifically, the recoverable amount of the group’s assets was calculated by estimating their fair
value and comparing it with the carrying amount of consolidated net invested capital at 31 December 2021 and at 30 June
2022 in order to examine whether recognised amounts had been impaired.


-----

The market multiples method is used to determine the fair value of goodwill, using listed comparable companies. These
multiples are compared with the implicit multiple calculated using the group’s actual figures. The market multiples analysis
based on companies operating in sectors comparable to those of Limacorporate (performed on the date the impairment
test was carried out on seven comparable companies) provides supporting evidence about the carrying amount of goodwill
recognised in the 31 December 2021 and 2020 consolidated financial statements and 30 September 2022 condensed
consolidated financial statements. This is because the market multiples (which show an average enterprise value of
between 14,5 and 20 times gross operating profit) are higher and/or in line with the multiple obtained by comparing the
group’s actual net invested capital at the end of 2021 (i.e., including goodwill) to consolidated gross operating profit.

As a result of such checks, based on market references (i.e., market multiples) compared with the group’s implicit multiple,
no impairment indicators have been detected to date for goodwill in the consolidated financial statements.

**[3.3] Property, plant and equipment**

The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and other assets at each period end is as follows:
   - €80,374 thousand at 30 September 2022;
   - €81,773 thousand at 31 December 2021;
   - €81,609 thousand at 30 September 2021;

   - €85,288 thousand at 31 December 2020.

Changes in property, plant and equipment assets between 30 September 2022 and 31 December 2021, as well as between
30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 and a breakdown of historical cost, accumulated amortisation and any
cumulative impairment losses are summarised in the following tables:

Land and building, amounting to €15,623 thousand, €15,746 thousand, €15,685 thousand and €15,907 thousand at 30
September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively.

30.09.2021 vs 31.12 2020:

a. €4,963 thousand for the contribution in kind made in 2021 by the shareholder for the acquisition of TechMah
Medical.
The contribution in kind is directly related to the shared-based payment of certain milestones regarding the
acquisition of TechMah Medical. Under the agreement signed in 2018, the subsidiary Lima USA allocated the
founding shareholders of TechMah Medical a set number of new EmilNewCo Sarl (indirect parent of
Limacorporate S.p.A. with a 100% interest) shares upon reaching set targets regarding the development of new
products benefiting the group.
The above-mentioned allocation of shares in October 2021 led to a share capital increase for EmilNewCo and
the recognition of an amount due from the founding shareholders of TechMah Medical equal to the liability
recognised by Lima USA for the contractual milestones to be settled. The two transactions between the founding
shareholders of Techmah Medical and Lima Group (EmilNewCo Sarl, Limacorporate S.p.A. and Lima USA) have
been offset using claim notes, which generated the capital injection referred to above.
b. capital injection by the shareholder of €20,000 thousand in June 2020.
c. €3,088 thousand for the agreement with HSS (Hospital for Special Surgery). On 4 January 2019, Lima USA and
HSS (the operator of the most prestigious US orthopaedic surgery hospital in New York) signed a collaboration
agreement for the production of implants on hospital grounds, via the following agreements:
I. a six-year lease for the premises where Lima USA will produce the implants for HSS, of which payment
for the first three years have been made by awarding HSS a fixed number of new Emil NewCo shares
and the second three years will be paid by monthly instalments;
II. a supply contract which establishes that HSS will bear the cost of any leasehold improvements made by
Lima USA and will receive a set number of new Emil NewCo shares in return
The accounting effects of the above transaction are as follows:
###### - recognition of other right-of-use assets for €1,793 thousand, lease liabilities of €875 thousand and other reserves
of €918 thousand.
###### - recognition of greater leasehold improvement costs of €2,170 thousand with a balancing increase of €2,170
thousand in other reserves.

Actuarial reserve was set up as a result of application of IAS 19 for post-employment benefits and has a negative balance
of €22 thousand, €22 thousand, €25 thousand and €25 thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September
2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively.

Translation reserve, with a positive balance of €1,965 thousand at 30 September 2022, €1,508 thousand at 31 December
2021, €766 thousand at 30 September 2021 and negative balance of €335 thousand at 31 December 2020, reflects the
changes in the group’s share of the equity of consolidated companies due to changes in exchange rates of such companies’
functional currencies compared to the presentation currency of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

The main items making up the other reserves are as follows:
###### - the revaluation reserve, which arose from the merger of Lima S.p.A., amounts to €111 thousand and is recognised
in compliance with Law no. 413 of 30 December 1991 in relation to deferred tax on the revalued amount of land
and industrial buildings. There were no changes in the reserve during the three-year period.
###### - other sundry reserves of €3,954 thousand, €1,400 thousand, €1,399 thousand, €1,399 thousand at 30 September
2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively.

Retained earnings (losses carried forward) amount to a negative net balance of €13,308 thousand at 30 September 2022,
€11,917 thousand at 31 December 2021 and at 30 September 2021, a positive net balance of €565 thousand at 31
December 2020.

Agents’ termination indemnity (€713 thousand, €925 thousand, €913 thousand and €889 thousand at 30 September 2022,
31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively) is the estimated liability deriving from the
application of ruling legislation and the contractual clauses in relation to the termination of agency contracts. Unlike accruals
to the provision for risks, warranties and other provisions, accruals to agents’ termination indemnity are classified by nature
among costs for services. The decreases of the period refer to utilisations of the provision following the termination of
agency contracts and the release of the provision when not due. The relevant liabilities were subject to actuarial calculation

by an independent expert.

Other provisions, amounting to €2,140 thousand, €2,997 thousand, €3,407 thousand and €2,820 thousand at 30
September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively, are comprised as follows:

   - the provision for charges of €1,573 thousand, €1,761 thousand, €1,373 thousand, and €750 thousand at 30
September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively, of which €1,573
thousand, €1,390 thousand, €1,036 thousand and €750 thousand related to commission expense on revenue yet
to be invoiced and €0 thousand, €371 thousand, €0 thousand and € 0 thousand related to highly probable
consultancy success fees the payment date of which is not yet known, both respectively at 30 September 2022,
31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020;

   - compensation for damage caused by products of €422 thousand, €423 thousand, €573 thousand and €630
thousand at 30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively.
   - other disputes/contingent liabilities of €145 thousand, €813 thousand, €1,461 thousand and €1,440 thousand at
30 September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively.

The increase of the nine-month of 2021 and for the nine-month of 2022 mainly refer to provision for charges related to
commission expenses on revenue due to the increase in volume and other disputes.

The decreases of nine-month of 2022 mainly refer to the closure of litigation with a former agent that resulted in the release
of the provision of €740 thousand.

On December 4, 2019, the parent was notified of a preliminary assessment report following the completion of the tax
assessment by the Friuli-Venezia Giulia regional tax authorities for 2016. On 3 February 2020, Limacorporate S.p.A. replied
to such preliminary assessment report pursuant to article 12.7 of Law no. 212 of 27 July 2000, asking the tax authorities
to recognise the lack of grounds of some of the allegations set out in the report and, accordingly, not to issue the
assessment notices, reserving its right to present further pleadings and start negotiations with the tax authorities.

To date, the tax authorities have not yet issued the assessment notice, which would enforce the notice, nor have the tax
authorities agreed to hold negotiations as hoped by the parent, following the comments it filed pursuant to article 12.7 of
Law no. 212 of 27 July 2000. Furthermore, based on the information available to date (also considering the specific
comments issued by the parent), the risk of losing the case is estimated as possible. Moreover, such risk is currently

difficult to quantify and is of an indeterminate amount, in light of the conclusions made by the parent and with no
negotiations being held with the tax authorities. In light of the above, the parent decided not to make any accrual to the
provision for risks.

During the course of the third and fourth quarter of 2022, the Italian government has issued some decrees in relation to
the so-called “pay-back” rule, according to which companies operating in the medical device sector are expected to
contribute to the excess spending of local authorities (“Regioni” and “Province”) on purchases of medical devices for the
years 2015 to 2018.

On November 14, 2022, Limacorporate SpA has filed an appeal with the central administrative tribunal (“Tribunale
Amministrativo del Lazio”) against the above mentioned decrees.

During the course of the month of November 2022, some “Regioni” and “Province” have communicated to Limacorporate
SpA their intention to proceed with the request for such “payback”. Two “Regioni” have additionally communicated the
amount requested.

Whilst Limacorporate SpA is fully convinced that its appeals will be successful, it cannot be certain of the outcome of the
legal proceedings, nor is it in the position to estimate the amount of the potential liability that might arise.

**[3.14] Employee benefits**

Employee benefits amounts to €1,603 thousand, €1,442 thousand €1,485 thousand and €1,421 thousand at 30 September
2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively

On 30 September 2022 and 2021, this item mainly consists of post-employment benefits due upon termination of
employment pursuant to current legislation in Italy. The actuarial model used to measure Italian post-employment benefits
(“TFR”) is based on the same assumptions previously used for measurement at 31 December 2020 and 2021, illustrated
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2020 and 2021, to which reference should be made,


-----

as there were no significant changes in the demographic or economic assumptions underlying the actuarial calculation in
the nine-months of 2021 and 2022, respectively.

non-current to current of the bond issued by Limacorporate S.p.A. in 2017, as it became redeemable within the next 12
months (August 2023). This value is related to senior secured bonds repayable in 2023 for a total nominal amount of €275

million. The bonds were initially recognised at fair value, net of directly related costs, and measured at amortised cost by
applying the effective interest rate method.

The bonds have coupons based on the 3-month Euribor plus a 3.75% spread, with a Euribor floor threshold of 0.00%.
They are listed on the Euro MTF market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the professional section of the ExtraMOT
market of the Italian Stock Exchange.

The coupons mature every three months on 15 February, 15 May, 15 August and 15 November each year starting from
15 November 2017.

The following guarantees were issued in relation to the bonds:

   - pledge on the shares of Limacorporate S.p.A.;
   - pledge on the shares of some subsidiaries;
   - pledge on some of the current accounts of the parent and some subsidiaries;
   - special lien on plant, equipment and other items of property, plant and equipment of the parent;
   - lien on certain categories of assets of some subsidiaries;
   - guarantees on some categories of assets of the parent and some subsidiaries.

In relation to the refinancing put in place in 2017, as well as the issue of bonds, Limacorporate also finalised an agreement
for a new super senior revolving credit facility for a maximum of €60 million. It may also be used partially, in several

instalments with set repayment terms. If the financial covenants are complied with, the interest rate is the same as the
bond, i.e., 3-month Euribor plus a 3.75% spread, with a Euribor floor threshold of 0.00%.

The same guarantees provided for the issue of the bonds were granted for this revolving credit facility; specifically:

   - pledge on the shares of Limacorporate S.p.A.;
   - pledge on the shares of some subsidiaries;
   - pledge on some of the current accounts of the parent and some subsidiaries;
   - special lien on plant, equipment and other items of property, plant and equipment of the parent;
   - lien on certain categories of assets of some subsidiaries;
   - guarantees on some categories of assets of the parent and some subsidiaries.

€54 million, €47 million €49 million and € 40 million of the revolving facility was used at 30 September 2022, 31 December
2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively.

If more than 35% (as explained in financing agreement) of the available amount of the revolving facility is used (i.e., drawdowns exceeding €21 million), a covenant related to the ratio of “Super Senior Net Debt” (represented by the utilization of
the revolving facility less cash and cash equivalents) and consolidated EBITDA which cannot exceed 1.83, is activated
under the terms of the contract. Such covenant was complied with at 30 September 2022 and 31 December 2021.

For 31 December 2020 and 30 September 2021 was complied a different covenant in fact due to the global health
emergency which has affected the countries where the group operates, this covenant was renegotiated in June 2020, at
the time of the shareholder’s €20,000 thousand capital injection and additional commitment for a further injection of €15,000
thousand in the event the new covenant is not complied with. In brief, the measurement and check of the previous net
financial position/EBITDA covenant was temporarily suspended until 30 September 2021, and was replaced with a new
covenant linked to simply maintaining a minimum level of availability liquidity (€10,000 thousand), which includes the
unused part of the revolving facility itself. The new covenant was comfortably complied with at 30 September 2021 and 31
December 2020.

On 11 August 2022, the Revolving Credit Facility was extended until 14 July 2023 under the same conditions.

Non-current financial liabilities (“Other current financial liabilities”) and current financial liabilities (“Other loan and
borrowing”) also include liabilities for the purchase of business units related to the amount due in 2023 for the acquisition
of a business unit from the group’s Sicilian distributor. The non-current amount is €185 thousand at 30 September 2022,
31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020). The current amount is €nil at 30 September 2022 and
31 December 2021, €136 thousand and 30 September 2021 and €1,645 thousand at 31 December 2020.

At operating level, the group has a matrix organisational structure split by product line, distribution channel and
geographical segment providing a coherent strategic vision of the business. This structure can be seen in the way
management monitors and directs the group’s activities. Specifically, senior management reviews the group’s results as a
whole as it does not have identifiable operating segments. Therefore, the group’s operations are presented as a single
segment for IFRS 8 reporting purposes.

A breakdown of revenue earned in 2022 and 2021 by product line, distribution channel and geographical segment is shown
below:

**C.** **Financial risk management**

The group is exposed to the following risks deriving from its use of financial instruments:
– credit risk;
– liquidity risk;
– market risk.

_Risk management system_

Overall responsibility for the design and oversight of the group’s risk management system lies with the parent’s board of
directors. This committee is in charge of developing and monitoring the group’s risk management policies.

|€'000|Decrease|Col3|30 September 2022|Increase|Col6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Equity Value Techma Liability|-10% 8|-5% 8.1|0% 8.1|5% 8.2|10% 8.3|


-----

The group’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse any risks it is exposed to, establish appropriate
limits and controls and monitor the risks and compliance with such limits. The committee regularly revisits the policies and
related systems to align them with market developments and the group’s business. The group aims to create a disciplined
and constructive control environment through training programmes, standards and management procedures so that its
employees are familiar with their roles and responsibilities.

The board of directors ensures compliance with the risk polices and management procedures and checks that the risk
management system is appropriate to deal with risks that could affect the group.

The group’s financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, loans, trade receivables and payables, current and

non-current assets and liabilities as well as derivatives.

In its normal business operations, the group is exposed to:

   - market risk, mainly currency and interest rate risks;
   - commercial or counterparty credit risks, related to the risk of default on commercial or financial obligations by
various counterparties as part of normal business operations or lending, investment and hedging transactions;
   - liquidity risk, related to the availability of financial resources and access to the credit market and refers to the
need to meet the group’s financial needs in the short term.

Financial risk management is carried out centrally and essentially ensures that there are enough financial resources to

meet business development needs and that resources are suitably invested in profitable activities.

_Market risk_

Market risk can be broken down into the following components:

   - interest rate risk,
   - currency risk.

_Interest rate risk_

The group’s exposure to interest rate risk is chiefly related to cash and cash equivalents, bonds and bank loans and
borrowings, especially the revolving credit facility that is managed centrally. On 30 September 2022 and 30 September
2021 the group does not have any interest rate hedges. A 100bps increase in the interest rate applied would have led to

an increase in financial expense of roughly €3.3 million.

_Currency risk_

As the group sells its products in various countries, it is exposed to currency risk. This risk mainly derives from sales in
currencies other than the Euro, like the US dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and Australian dollar.

The group regularly assesses its exposure to market financial risks. It does not manage such risks by using derivatives.

_Credit risk_

Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument may default on a contractual obligation
generating a loss for the group. It mainly arises on trade receivables and debt instruments.

The group’s maximum exposure to this type of risk is the assets’ carrying amount.

Some of the markets on which the group operates have a higher level of risk, such as southern Italy, where the health
system is deeply in debt, southern European countries, like Spain and Portugal, and eastern European countries, such as
Croatia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where collection times are very long.

Most of the group’s receivables are due from public institutions, thus solely linked to the country risk. Moreover, payments
from public administration have improved notably in some cases in recent years thanks to measures taken to cut public
entity debt with private companies.


-----

Credit risk is also mitigated by the fact that the group is increasing its sales in countries with shorter average collection
times. Therefore, the weight of markets with higher credit risk will be reduced.

At 30 September 2022 and 2021, the group does not have exposures with individual customers for more than 10% of its
total trade receivables.

The amount of financial assets for which recovery is doubtful is immaterial in terms of the total amount of receivables and
is, in any case, covered by adequate accruals to the relevant allowances.

_Liquidity risk_

Liquidity risk derives from the ability to obtain financial resources at a sustainable cost to carry out the group’s normal
business operations.

The group uses the usual tools to manage current trade receivables, as well as partially using the facilities available.

Moreover:

  - the group has debt instruments and credit lines to deal with liquidity requirements;

there are no significant concentrations of liquidity risk with regard to financial assets.Further detail are included in Going
concerned paragraph.

**[4.3] Significant non-recurring transactions**

The condensed consolidated financial statement were not affected by significant non-recurring transactions.

**[4.4] Guarantees**

Reference should be made to section [3.15] of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

**[4.5] Related party transactions**

The group carries out transactions with the ultimate parent recognised in line with the provisions of IAS 24. They are all
financial in nature and are performed with full transparency and on an arm’s length basis. They do not include typical and/or

unusual transactions.

Details of related party transactions carried out during 30 September 2022 and 30 September 2021 are as follows:

No other significant related party transactions took place during the period.

The group operates in a market dominated by entities directly or indirectly controlled by the Italian government through

state bodies, agencies, related parties and other organisations (entities related to government bodies). The parent does
not carry out transactions with other entities related to government bodies, such as, for example, the sale and purchase of
goods and materials, the supply or receipt of services, leasing of assets or use of public services.

_Transactions with Emil Holding II S.à.r.l._

Financial transactions with the ultimate parent are part of the parent’s normal business operations and take place at
conditions similar to those applied to transactions with non-related parties.

**[4.6] Fees of directors and key management personnel**

The remuneration of management was as follows:

**Total** **2,485** **58** **706** **54** **1,778**

For more details of the increase of management remuneration, see section [3.24].

**[4.7] Management Incentive plans**

In accordance with IFRS 2, the parent identified cash-settled share-based payment incentive plans for some managers.

Assumptions about the fair value of the share-based payment plans are based on the Monte Carlo method (by simulating
the group’s gross operating profit and equity value).

In previous years, the parent had defined two types of plans:

|Col1|30/09/2022|Q3 2022|30/09/2021|Q3 2021|Variation 30/09/2022 - 30/09/2021|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Management remuneration|2 ,485|58|706|54|1,778|
|Total|2 ,485|58|706|54|1,778|


-----

   - **Virtual share plan** **(“VSP”)**

On 23 November 2016, the parent’s shareholders approved the 2016-2030 virtual share plan for one of its managers. This
includes the free award of options to subscribe the parent’s ordinary shares. The manager has the right to receive a number
of options each year calculated using a pre-set formula.

The plan vests on 31 December 2030 although this date may be brought forward in the case of i) an IPO, ii) a change of
control, or iii) leaver events that lead to the beneficiary leaving the parent.

The manager’s right to exercise the options vests in line with their continued employment relationship with the events i), ii)
and ii) being early exercise events.

This plan qualifies as a cash-settled plan under IFRS 2. Its fair value was calculated using market models and the market
data at the reporting dates (such as interest rate curves, historical price curves of listed comparable companies’ shares,
price volatility of listed comparable companies’ shares) as well as non-market conditions (the probability that the above
events will take place). The parent updates the calculation each period. Following the step down from the role of CEO (the
only beneficiary of the VSP) in the first half of 2022, the VSP amount has been defined and paid in two tranche: the first
has been paid in has been paid in May 2022 and the second will be paid in November 2022.

   - **MPP plan**

In September 2016, the parent introduced an incentive plan for some group employees who signed agreements with Emil
Holding I (Emil Holding II’s controlling shareholder providing for i) the award of shares of Emil Holding II (the company that
manages and coordinates the parent) to the plan beneficiaries, ii) the granting of call options by the beneficiaries to Emil
Holding I whereby Emil Holding I can acquire the shares held by the beneficiaries if certain events occur, iii) the granting
of put options by Emil Holding I to the beneficiaries whereby the latter can sell their shares in Emil Holding II at the same
conditions set for the call option, generating an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid by the
beneficiaries (on the subscription date or deferred) and the carrying amount of the shares at the option exercise date. The
options can be exercised if one of the events occurs.

This plan qualifies as a cash-settled plan under IFRS 2. Its fair value was calculated using market models and the market

data at the reporting dates (such as interest rate curve) as well as non-market conditions (the probability that the above
leaver events will take place). The plan liability represents the plan’s future value less the cost incurred by each beneficiary
as its initial investment to enter the plan. The parent updates the calculation each year.

These plans led to recognition of a non-current liability of €0 million, €4,8 million, €4,8 million and €5,2 million at 30
September 2022, 31 December 2021, 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020 respectively and costs of services of
€941 thousand at 30 September 2022 and €466 thousand at 30 September 2021.

Additionally, in June 2022 Emil Holding I and certain employees agreed a share-based bonus payment to be activated at
the occurrence of certain events. Such bonus payment has been accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment,
its fair value being recognized as personnel expenses from the grant date until the expected duration of the vesting period,

with a corresponding increase of an equity reserve. This plan led to a recognition of personnel expenses of €1,989
thousand at 30 September 2022.

**[4.9] Relevant events occurred during the period**

**Impacts of Covid-19 pandemic**

The periods 2020-2021 were dominated by the need to curb the spread of Covid-19, however, the extremely high
vaccination rates in some countries, the individual containment and protection measures adopted and the reduced number
of hospitalisations and deaths caused by the Omicron variant made the still present public health emergency more

manageable.


-----

Indeed, as demonstrated by the results set out above and despite the resurgence of global sales falling short of
expectations, the group was able to contain its operating costs and, thus, meet very satisfactory financial and profit targets.
Together with its confirmed financial soundness, this means that the group is well placed to cover its operating
requirements and future development plans.

Moreover, based on the characteristics of its markets and the backlog of elective surgeries accumulated over these past
two years, management is confident that demand will exceed pre-pandemic levels in the medium term and resume its
previous trend, which is also linked to the demographic trend. Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of Banca
d’Italia/Consob/Isvap document no. 2 of 6 February 2009 and IAS 1.25-26, based on the above and on financial support

confirmation from parent company EQT Luxembourg Management S.à.r.l., the directors believe that going concern is
comfortably ensured, even in the current uncertain macroeconomic context.

Though 2022 did not see the back of Covid-19, vaccinations gradually spread throughout large areas of the planet and the
latest variant Omicron that hit in late autumn was less severe and lethal. This meant the pandemic was more manageable
and normality was partially restored in early 2022.

**Going concern**

The fact that the company’s bonds and revolving credit facility mature in August 2023 and February 2023, respectively,
and the company has no sufficient funds to repay them causes doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

However, the directors believe that such doubt has been resolved because the shareholder confirmed that it will financially
support the company, enabling it to continue as a going concern until the approval of the financial statements at 31
December 2023.

**Russia/Ukraine situation**

In relation to relevant events during the period, the growing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine exploded into armed conflict
in late February following the Russian army’s invasion of the country. Still under way, it is impossible to predict how the
conflict will evolve in the medium term. However, the group does not have any significant direct customers in this area,
with combined sales in the two countries counting for less than 0.5% of its revenue, and has no direct suppliers there. The
indirect repercussions of the conflict, on the other hand, will see a further increase in inflation, especially in energy prices,
but also in the medium term affecting certain raw materials used by the group, with potential impacts on sales margins.

**[4.10] Events after the reporting date**

During the course of the third and fourth quarter of 2022, the Italian government has issued some decrees in relation to
the so-called “pay-back” rule, according to which companies operating in the medical device sector are expected to
contribute to the excess spending of local authorities (“Regioni” and “Province”) on purchases of medical devices for the
years 2015 to 2018.

On November 14th 2022, Limacorporate SpA has filed an appeal with the central administrative tribunal (“Tribunale
Amministrativo del Lazio”) against the above mentioned decrees.

During the course of the month of November 2022, some “Regioni” and “Province” have communicated to Limacorporate
SpA their intention to proceed with the request for such “payback”. Two “Regioni” have additionally communicated the
amount requested.

Whilst Limacorporate SpA is fully convinced that its appeals will be successful, it cannot be certain of the outcome of the
legal proceedings, nor is it in the position to estimate the amount of the potential liability that might arise.

##### Independent auditors’ report

###### To the board of directors of Limacorporate S.p.A.

 Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of
Limacorporate Group (the “group”), which comprise the consolidated statements of
financial position as at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019, the consolidated income
statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated
statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash flow for the
years then ended and notes thereto (the “three-year financial statements”), which
include a summary of the significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying three-year financial statements give a true and fair
view of the consolidated financial position of the Limacorporate Group as at 31
December 2021, 2020 and 2019 and of its consolidated financial performance and
cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards endorsed by the European Union.

###### Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (the
“ISA Italia”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
“Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the three-year financial statements” section of
our report. We are independent of the Limacorporate S.p.A. (the “parent”) in
accordance with the ethics and independence rules and standards applicable in Italy
to audits of financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

###### Other matters

The three-year financial statements have been prepared for their inclusion in the
offering memorandum drawn up by the parent as part of its potential issue of notes.

_Independent auditors’ report_
_31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019_

###### Responsibilities of the parent’s directors and board of statutory auditors (“Collegio Sindacale”) for the three-year financial statements

The directors are responsible for the preparation of three-year financial statements
that give a true and fair view in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards endorsed by the European Union and, within the terms established by the
Italian law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.

The directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going
concern and for the appropriate use of the going concern basis in the preparation of
the three-year financial statements and for the adequacy of the related disclosures.
The use of this basis of accounting is appropriate unless the directors believe that the
conditions for liquidating the parent or ceasing operations exist or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

The Collegio Sindacale is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by
the Italian law, the group’s financial reporting process.

###### Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the three-year financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the three-year
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with ISA Italia will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these three-year financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISA Italia, we exercise professional judgement
and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

###### — identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the three-year
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

###### — obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control;

###### — evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;

###### — conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on
the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the
related disclosures in the three-year financial statements or, if such disclosures

_Independent auditors’ report_
_31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019_

are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern;

###### — evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the three-year financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the three-year financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation;

###### — obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of
the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for
our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at the appropriate
level required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies
in internal control that we identify during our audit.

###### Notes to the consolidated financial statements

**[2.1] General information**
The Limacorporate Group (the “Group”) creates, designs and sells joint implants and orthopaedic solutions in
the medical sector.
The parent, Limacorporate S.p.A. (“Limacorporate” or the “parent”), was set up and is domiciled in Italy. Its
registered office is at Via Nazionale 52, San Daniele del Friuli (Udine) and its company registration number is
173824.
The group carries out most of its business at its registered office while some activities are also performed by
the subsidiaries.
The three-year consolidated financial statements as at and for the years ended 31 December 2019, 2020 and
2021 (the “three-year financial statements) include the financial statements of the parent and the subsidiaries
(together the “group”).
These three-year financial statements, which will be submitted for the approval of the Board of Directors of the
Parent Company, has been prepared for the purposes of the Company’s issue of floating rate note under Rule
144A/Regulation S.
The parent is managed and coordinated by Emil Holding II S.à.r.l., whose details are provided below:
   - Registered office: 26A, Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg
   - Legal form: limited liability company
   - Description of its business activities and main operations: holding company
   - Parent’s name: Emil NewCo S.à.r.l.
   - Name of the ultimate indirect parent: EQT Luxembourg Management S.à r.l.

**[2.2] Format and content of the consolidated financial statements**
The three-year consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019, 2020 and 2021, drafted on the basis
of the ability of the parent and the other consolidated companies to continue as a going concern, have been
prepared pursuant to articles 2 and 3 of Legislative decree no. 38/2005 in compliance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the
European Commission, which include the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), in addition to the previous International Accounting Standards (IAS) and
the interpretations of the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) still in effect (together the “IFRS”).

The three-year consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019, 2020 and 2021 of Limacorporate
Group have been prepared for their inclusion in the offering memorandum drawn up by the parent as part of
its potential issue of notes.

These consolidated financial statements comprise the statement of financial position, income statement,
statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flows and these notes.
They comply with the provisions of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements and the general principle of
historical cost, except for those items that, pursuant to the IFRS, are measured at fair value, as explained in
the accounting policies of the individual captions in note 3. The statement of financial position has been
prepared by separating assets and liabilities into current and non-current, whereas costs are classified in the
income statements on the basis of their nature. The statement of cash flows has been prepared using the
indirect method.

The notes to the consolidated financial statements include the information generally required by ruling
legislation and the IFRS, suitably presented with reference to the financial statements’ schedules used.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as the related
assumptions are deemed to be met.

All figures are in thousands of Euros, unless indicated otherwise. The Euro is the parent’s functional and
presentation currency. For each financial statements’ caption, the corresponding amount of the previous year
is provided for comparative purposes.

**[2.3] Consolidation scope**
Subsidiaries are those companies over which the group has control, as defined by IFRS 10 Consolidated
financial statements. Control exists when the group has the power to, directly or indirectly, govern the financial
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements starting from when control is assumed and
until such control ceases to exist.

Subsidiaries are included in the consolidation scope from when the group acquires control, as defined above,
and are excluded from when the group no longer has control.

Lima (Beijing) Medical Devices Co. Ltd. incorporated under Chinese law in December 2020 was included in
the consolidated scope in 2021. It had not been consolidated in 2020 as it only began operations in 2021.

The Mississauga-based Lima Orthopaedics Canada Inc. was incorporated under Canadian law in October
2021. It is fully owned by Limacorporate S.p.A.. As the company will began operations during the first half of
2022 and considering its immateriality, the group decided not to consolidate it.

For consolidation purposes, the figures of the individual companies at the reporting date were restated in
compliance with the IFRS adopted by the group. The reporting date of all of the consolidated companies is 31
December.
r
The basis of consolidation is set out below:

###### - The line-by-line method, showing the portions of equity and profit or loss for the year attributable to
non-controlling interests and recognising assets, liabilities, revenues and costs regardless of the
percentage held in the subsidiaries.

###### - Eliminating items deriving from intragroup transactions involving consolidated companies, including
any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions and recognising the resulting
deferred tax effects.

###### - Eliminating intragroup dividends and reallocating them to opening equity reserves.
 - Eliminating the carrying amount of investments in consolidated companies and the relevant portion of
equity, allocating the resulting positive and negative differences to the relevant captions (assets,
liabilities and equity), as defined at the time of acquisition of the investment and considering any
subsequent variations. After control is acquired, any acquisitions of non-controlling interests or sales
of shares to non-controlling interests that do not entail loss of control are recognised as owner
transactions and the relevant effects are taken directly to equity. Any differences between the change
in equity attributable to non-controlling interests and cash and cash equivalents exchanged are
recognised under changes in equity attributable to the owners of the parent.

###### - The financial statements of foreign operations are translated into Euros using the annual average rate
for income statement items and the closing rate for statement of financial position items. The difference
between the two rates along with the translation differences deriving from changes in opening and
closing exchange rates are recognised as changes in equity.

The following rates were applied in translating the financial statements of foreign operations:

**[2.4] Basis of presentation**

**[2.4.1] Business combinations and goodwill**
Business combinations are recognised using the acquisition method under IFRS 3. To this end, the acquired
identifiable assets and the assumed liabilities are recognised at their respective acquisition-date fair value.
The consideration transferred in a business combination is the aggregate of the fair value, at the date of
exchange, of assets acquired, assumed liabilities and equity instruments issued by the acquirer, in exchange
for control of the acquiree.
Goodwill is the positive difference between the consideration transferred, increased by both the fair value at
the acquisition date of any non-controlling interests already held in the acquiree and the amount of noncontrolling interests held in the acquiree by third parties (measured at fair value or based on the present value
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets), and the fair value of such assets and liabilities.
At the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to the single cash-generating unit that is expected to benefit from
the synergies of the business combination.
If the difference between the consideration transferred (increased by the above components) and the fair value
of the net assets acquired is negative, this is recognised as a gain from a bargain purchase in the income
statement in the year of acquisition.
Any goodwill related to non-controlling interests is included in the carrying amount of the relevant equity
investments.
After initial recognition, goodwill is not amortised and is recognised net of any cumulative impairment losses,
calculated using the methods set out in section [2.4.6] Impairment losses on assets. As set out in section [3.2]
of this report, the market multiples method is used to determine the recoverability of goodwill, using listed
comparable companies. These multiples are compared with the implicit multiple calculated using the group’s
actual figures.
IFRS 3 is not applied retrospectively to business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2018, i.e., the
date of the parent’s transition to the IFRS. Accordingly, the amount of goodwill determined under the previous
reporting standards, i.e., the carrying amount at such date, is maintained for such business combinations,
subject to the recognition of any impairment losses.

**[2.4.2] Intangible assets**
An intangible asset is an identifiable asset without physical substance, controlled by the group and that
generates future economic benefits, in addition to goodwill when acquired against consideration.
Identifiability is defined with reference to the possibility of distinguishing the intangible asset acquired from
goodwill. An intangible asset is identifiable when it: (i) arises from a legal or contractual right or (ii) is separable,
i.e., can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or together with a related

_statements”)_

contract. An entity controls an asset if it has the power to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the
underlying resource and to restrict the access of others to such benefits.
Intangible assets are stated at cost, which is determined in same manner as for property, plant and equipment.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over their estimated useful lives starting from when they
are available for use.
The amortisation rates adopted in 2019, 2020 and 2021 are shown in the following table by asset category:

**2021 - 2020 - 2019 (*)**

Development expenditure 5-10 years

Patents and intellectual property rights 10 - 20 years

Licences, trademarks and similar rights 3 - 5 years

Other Contract term/ maximum 6 years

_* There were no changes to the amortisation rates over the three years_

_Development expenditure_
Development expenditure is expensed when incurred.
Development expenditure incurred for a specific project is only capitalised when the group can demonstrate
the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use and for sale, its
intention to complete such asset and use or sell it, how the intangible asset will generate probable future
economic benefits, the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the
development and its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its
development.
Subsequent to initial recognition, development expenditure is measured at cost less any accumulated
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset starts from when the
development phase has been completed and the asset is available for use. The asset is amortised over the
period for which the underlying project is expected to generate revenue for the group.

_Patents and intellectual property rights_
Patents and intellectual property rights refer to costs for patents owned by Limacorporate S.p.A.

_Licences, trademarks and similar rights_
This caption refers to costs to file and register trademarks and costs incurred to acquire commercial licences.
The acquisition costs are amortised over a period equal to the useful life of the acquired right.

_Other intangible assets_

This caption refers to leasehold improvements carried out in prior years. The capitalised costs are amortised on the basis
of the residual term of the relevant lease contract.

**[2.4.3] Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment are recognised at acquisition or production cost including directly attributable
costs incurred to ready the asset for its intended use. Such cost includes costs to replace parts of equipment
and plant when they are incurred if they meet the recognition requirements.
Assets acquired under business combinations before 1 January 2018 (the date of the parent’s transition to
the IFRS) are recognised at their pre-existing carrying amount, determined within such business
combinations in accordance with the previous reporting standards, i.e., at deemed cost.
The carrying amount (cost less accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment losses) of the replaced
parts of equipment and plant is taken to profit or loss at the time of replacement.
Maintenance and repair costs, which do not add to the value of the assets and/or prolong their residual useful
lives, are expensed when incurred. Otherwise they are capitalised.
Property, plant and equipment are stated net of any accumulated depreciation and any cumulative impairment

losses determined using the methods set out below. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over

The residual value of the assets, the useful life and the depreciation method applied are reviewed at each year
end and adjusted prospectively if necessary.
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, such parts are
recognised separately. Land, free of construction or annexed to buildings, is recognised separately and is not
depreciated since it has an unlimited useful life.
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment and every significant part initially recognised
is eliminated on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. The gain
or loss arising from the derecognition of the item (calculated as the difference between the carrying amount
of the asset and the net disposal proceeds) is included in profit or loss when the item is derecognised.

**[2.4.4] Leases**
If a contract contains a lease, at the commencement date, the lessee shall recognise an asset representing
its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease
payments. The lessee shall recognise interest on the lease liability and depreciation of the right-of-use asset
separately. At inception of a contract, the entity shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The
contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of
time in exchange for consideration.

**[2.4.5] Equity investments**
Investments in associates are measured using the equity method, recognising the group’s share of the profits
or losses for the year in the income statement, with the exception of the effects related to other changes in the
equity of the investee, other than owner transactions, that are directly recognised in other comprehensive
income.
In the event of losses exceeding the carrying amount of the equity investment, the excess is recognised in a
specific provision to the extent the parent is obliged to fulfil legal or constructive obligations to the investee or
to cover its losses.
Investments in other companies are measured at fair value and the fair value gains and losses are taken to
equity. If fair value cannot be reliably determined, they are measured at cost, adjusted for any impairment
losses.

**[2.4.6] Impairment losses**
At the reporting date, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, financial assets
and equity investments is tested for indicators of impairment. Should such indicators exist, the group estimates
the recoverable amount of the asset to check the recoverability of the carrying amount and determine any
impairment loss to be recognised. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or not yet available for use are

tested for impairment at least annually, irrespective of whether any indication of impairment exists, or more
frequently if an indication of impairment exists.
In order to identify impairment losses, assets are grouped into the smallest identifiable group of assets that
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets
(the cash-generating unit, CGU). Reference should be made to section [3.2] Goodwill for details of the group’s
CGU. The goodwill generated by business combinations is allocated to the CGU that is expected to benefit
from the combinations’ synergies. The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the higher of its value in
use and its fair value less costs to sell.
The market multiples method is used to determine the value in use using listed comparable companies. These
multiples are compared with the implicit multiple calculated using the group’s actual figures. When the carrying
amount of an asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the group recognises an impairment loss in
profit or loss. Impairment losses on the CGU are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to it and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of their carrying amounts.
Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed. Impairment losses on other assets are reversed to the
carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation and depreciation) had no impairment
losses been recognised in prior years.

**[2.4.7] Financial instruments**
The financial instruments held by the group are described below.
_Financial assets_
Financial assets include equity investments, loans and borrowings, as well as derivatives with a positive fair
value, trade receivables and other assets, in addition to cash and cash equivalents.
Specifically, cash and cash equivalents include cash, bank deposits and highly marketable securities that are
readily convertible to cash and are subject to an immaterial risk of changes in value.
Financial assets represented by debt instruments are classified in the consolidated financial statements and
measured using the business model adopted by the group for managing financial assets and based on the
cash flows related to each financial asset. Financial assets also include equity investments not held for trading.
Such assets are strategic investments and the group has opted to recognise fair value gains or losses thereon
through profit or loss (fair value through profit or loss, FVTPL).
Financial assets are tested for impairment using a model based on expected credit losses.

_Financial liabilities_
Financial liabilities include loans and borrowings, as well as derivatives with a negative fair value, trade
payables and other liabilities.
Financial liabilities are classified and measured at amortised cost, with the exception of those initially measured
at fair value, e.g., financial liabilities related to considerations for business combinations and derivatives and
financial liabilities for options on non-controlling interests.
_Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities_
A financial asset or liability (or, where applicable, part of a financial asset/liability or part of a group of similar
financial assets/liabilities) is derecognised when the group unconditionally transfers the contractual rights to
receive the cash flows of the financial asset or the obligation to make payments or fulfil other obligations related
to the liability.
_Derivatives and hedging transactions_
Derivatives are solely used for hedging purposes, in order to reduce interest rate risk. They are recognised
using hedge accounting only when, at inception, the derivative is designated as a hedge. All derivatives are
measured at fair value.
If hedge accounting cannot be applied, fair value gains or losses on the derivative are taken to profit or loss.

**[2.4.8] Inventories**
Raw materials and packaging are measured at the lower of purchase cost and estimated replacement value
based on market trends. The cost is calculated using the weighted average cost for the year.

_Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial_
_statements”)_
12


-----

Semi-finished products and finished goods are measured at purchase or production cost, considering their
stage of completion, or their realisable value based on market trends, if lower. The production cost includes
the reasonably attributable portion of direct and indirect manufacturing costs.
The resulting amount is written down through the allowance for inventory write-down to account for items
whose expected realisable value is lower than their cost.

**[2.4.9] Trade receivables and other assets and trade payables and other liabilities**
Trade receivables and other assets that derive from the supply of credit facilities, goods or services to third
parties are classified under current assets, except when they are due after one year of the reporting date with
reference to loans and receivables. If they have a set due date, current and non-current loans and receivables,
other current and non-current assets and trade receivables, with the exception of derivatives, are measured
at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest method. If they do not have a set due date, financial
assets are measured at cost. Loans and receivables due after one year that are non-interest bearing or
accruing interest lower than market rates are discounted using market rates.
The above financial assets are measured using the expected credit loss impairment model introduced by IFRS
9.
Trade payables and other liabilities that arise from the acquisition of credit facilities, goods or services from a
third part supplier are classified under current liabilities, except when they are due after one year of the
reporting date with reference to loans and borrowings.
On initial recognition, current and non-current loans and borrowings, other current and non-current liabilities
and trade payables are stated at fair value, which normally coincides with the transaction price including
transaction costs. Subsequently, with the exception of derivatives, all financial liabilities are measured at
amortised cost calculated using the effective interest method. Hedged financial liabilities are measured in
accordance with hedge accounting.

**[2.4.10] Employee benefits**
The liability related to short-term employee benefits paid during the employment relationship is recognised on
an accruals basis at the amount accrued at the reporting date.
The liability related to employee benefits paid upon or after termination of the employment relationship via
defined benefit plans, is recognised at the amount accrued at the reporting date.
The liability related to employee benefits paid upon or after termination of the employment relationship via
defined benefit plans, net of any plan assets and advances granted, is calculated using actuarial assumptions
and recognised on an accruals basis in line with the service needed to obtain the benefits. Such liability is
calculated by independent actuaries. The gain or loss deriving from the actuarial calculation is fully recognised
in the statement of comprehensive income for the relevant year.
Defined benefit plan liabilities are measured using the actuarial assumptions set out in section [3.14] Employee
benefits.

**[2.4.11] Provisions for risks and charges**
The provisions for risks and charges are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present
obligation or transfer it to third parties at the reporting date. Where the effect of the discounting is material, the
provisions are calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money. When discounting is used, the carrying amount of the provision
increases to reflect the passage of time and this increase is recognised as borrowing cost.

**[2.4.12] Share-based payments**

_Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial_
_statements”)_
13


-----

The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements granted to employees is
generally recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the
awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the
related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount
ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market
performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the
grant-date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions. With regard to nonvesting conditions, any differences between expected and actual outcomes do not have an impact on the
consolidated financial statements.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of cash-settled share-based payments is
recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the
employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and
at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payments. Any fair value gains or losses are
recognised in profit or loss.
The parent has agreements with some managers for the award of options and/or shares (see section [4.7]
Incentive plans).

**[2.4.13] Revenue and expense**
Based on the five-step model introduced by IFRS 15, the group recognises revenue after identifying the
contract(s) with a customer and the performance obligations in the contract (transfer of goods and/or services),
determining the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for fulfilling performance
obligations (at a point in time or over time). Revenue is measured on the basis of the transaction price excluding
amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Based on the group’s internal analysis of contracts with customers,
the group has not identified any performance obligations that are satisfied over time and, therefore, the group
recognises revenue upon the transfer of control of the promised goods or services to the customer. Revenue
is measured to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the amount
can be measured reliably.
Revenue is adjusted for any discounts and volume rebates allowed by the group in contracts with customers.
Expense is recognised when the goods and services are sold or consumed during the year or by systematic
allocation, or when it is not possible to identify their future use.
Expense items are classified by nature in accordance with the applicable IFRS.

**[2.4.14] Government grants**
Grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received.
Grants related to income are taken to profit or loss in the year in which the relevant expense is recognised.
Grants related to assets received for projects and development activities are recognised under liabilities and
subsequently recognised under operating revenue in line with the amortisation and depreciation of the relevant
assets.
Grants due for investments in research and development are recognised in line with the progress of the
research, calculated on the basis of the progress reports issued to the relevant bodies and the stage of
completion reported by those in charge of the research, if all requirements for their disbursement are met.

**[2.4.15] Financial income and expense**
Financial income and expense are recognised on the basis of interest accrued on the net amount of the
relevant financial assets and liabilities, using the effective interest method.

**[2.4.16] Dividends**
Dividends are recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established.

**[2.4.17] Income taxes**
Income taxes recognised in profit or loss are the sum of current and deferred taxes.

_Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial_
_statements”)_
14


-----

Income taxes for the year are determined on the basis of ruling legislation. They are recognised in profit or
loss, except for those related to items recognised directly in equity, for which the tax effect is accounted for
directly in equity.
Income tax payables are recognised under current tax liabilities, net of advances paid. Any tax credits are
recognised under current tax assets.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities (resulting from the application of the accounting policies set out in note 4 “Basis of
presentation”) and their tax bases (deriving from the application of the tax legislation ruling in the country of
the subsidiaries). Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the group has the legally
enforceable right to offset.
Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates expected to be enacted in the years in which the temporary
differences will be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised on temporary differences and to the extent that it is probable the group will
have future taxable profits that will allow their recovery.

**[2.4.18] Fair value**
IFRS 13 is a common framework for fair value measurement and relevant disclosure when this measurement
is required or allowed by other IFRS. Specifically, the standard sets out the definition of fair value as the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date.
IFRS 13 establishes a hierarchy that categorises the inputs used in the valuation techniques adopted to
measure fair value into different levels, as follows:

- level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the
ability to access at the measurement date;

- level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities,
either directly or indirectly;

- level 3: unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities.
In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised within
different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorised in its
entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire
measurement.
The group recognises transfers among the different levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the year in
which the transfer took place.
Reference should be made to the notes to the individual financial statements’ items for the definition of the fair
value hierarchy level used to classify the individual instruments measured at fair value or whose fair value is
disclosed.
The fair value of derivatives is calculated by discounting estimated cash flows using the market interest rates
at the reporting date and the credit default swaps issued by the counterparty and group companies, to include
the non-performance risk explicitly provided for under IFRS 13.
Where market prices are not available, the fair value of non-derivative medium/long-term financial instruments
is calculated by discounting estimated cash flows using the market interest rates at the reporting date and
considering counterparty risk for financial assets and credit risk for financial liabilities.

**[2.4.19] Use of estimates**
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors were required to apply accounting policies
that are, at times, based on judgements or past experience or assumptions deemed reasonable and realistic
at the time, depending on the relevant circumstances. The application of such estimates and assumptions
impacts the carrying amounts recognised in the statement of financial position, income statement, statement
of comprehensive income and statement of cash flows, in addition to the disclosure provided. The end results
of the assessments in which such estimates and assumptions were used may differ from those recognised in

_Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial_
_statements”)_
15


-----

the consolidated financial statements due to the inherent uncertainty of the assumptions and the conditions
underlying the estimates.
Actual results may differ from those estimated. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The effect of a change in accounting estimates is recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change, if the
change affects that period only, or the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both.
Estimates mainly refer to the following captions:

###### - impairment losses on non-current assets and goodwill;
 - loss allowance;
 - allowance for inventory write-down;
 - recoverability of deferred tax assets;
 - estimate of the provisions for risks and contingent liabilities;
 - financial liabilities;
 - employee incentive plans.

_Impairment losses on non-current assets and goodwill_
Non-current assets include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets including goodwill and other
financial assets.
Management periodically revises the carrying amount of non-current assets held and used and assets held for
sale when events and circumstances require such revision. This is performed using the estimates of cash flows
the group expects to derive from using or selling the asset and suitable discount rates for calculating the
present value.
When the carrying amount of a non-current asset has been impaired, the group recognises an impairment loss
equal to the excess between the carrying amount and the amount to be recovered through use or sale of the
asset, determined using the parent’s or group’s most recent plans. Reference should be made to note [4.4]
Impairment losses.

_Loss allowance_
The loss allowance is management’s best estimate of the potential credit losses on trade receivables from end
customers. Reference should be made to note 4.8 Trade receivables and other assets and trade payables and
other liabilities for a description of the criteria used in estimating the allowance.

_Allowance for inventory write-down_
Inventories of slow-moving raw materials and finished goods are periodically analysed on the basis of historical
data and the possibility of selling them at prices lower than normal market transactions. If, as a result, the
carrying amount of inventories needs to be written down, the group recognises a specific allowance for
inventory write-down.

_Recoverability of deferred tax assets_
The group pays taxes in numerous countries and some estimates are required to calculate the taxes in each
jurisdiction. It recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available and over a period of time compatible with the time horizon implicit in the management estimates.

_Estimate of the provisions for risks and contingent liabilities_
The group could be subject to legal and tax disputes regarding a vast range of issues that are subject to the
jurisdiction of various countries. Disputes and litigation against the group are subject to a different degree of
uncertainty, including the facts and circumstances inherent to each dispute, the jurisdiction and different
applicable laws. In the ordinary course of business, management consults its legal consultants and legal and
tax experts. The group recognises a liability for such disputes when it is deemed probable that they will result
in an outflow of resources and when the amount of the resulting losses can be reasonably estimated. If an

_statements”)_

outflow of resources is possible but the amount cannot be determined, such fact is disclosed in the notes to
the consolidated financial statements.

_Employee incentive plans and financial liabilities_
Reference is made to section [4.7] for a description of the calculation of the fair value of share-based payments
as part of group management incentive plans.
Section [3.15] provides details of the calculation of fair value of the group’s financial liabilities.

**[2.4.20] Translation of foreign currency items**
The financial statements of each consolidated company are prepared using the functional currency related to
the economy where each company operates. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are
recognised at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities
are subsequently translated at the closing rate and any exchange differences are taken to profit or loss. Foreign
currency non-monetary assets and liabilities recognised at historical cost are translated using the exchange
rate at the date of the transaction.
For consolidation purposes, the foreign currency financial statements prepared for consolidation purposes of
the consolidated companies are translated using the closing rates for asset and liability captions, including
goodwill and consolidation adjustments, and the average rate for the year (if similar to the respective
transaction-date rates) or the period under consolidation, if lower, for income statement captions. The relevant
exchange differences are taken directly to the statement of comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or
loss when control over the investee is lost and, thus, it is deconsolidated.

**[2.4.21] Operating segments**
An operating segment is a component of an entity:

###### - that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses (including
revenue and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity);

###### - whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make
decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and

###### - for which discrete financial information is available.

Note [4.1] provides information about the single operating segment identified.

**[2.4.22] New standards and interpretations, revisions and amendments to existing standards**
As required by IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, below are the new
standards and interpretations, in addition to amendments to existing and applicable standards and
interpretations, applicable starting from 1 January 2019 and not yet in effect at the reporting date.

_New standards and interpretations applicable from 1 January 2019_
On 13 January 2016, the IASB published the new standard IFRS 16 Leases, which replaces IAS 17. The
European Union endorsed the standard by publishing it on 9 November 2017. IFRS 16 applies to financial
statements for years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The new standard eliminates the different treatment
based on operating or finance leases, provides for a number of practical expedients for its initial application
and introduces the concept of control to the definition of a lease. Specifically, to determine whether a contract
is a lease, in accordance with IFRS 16, the lessee shall assess whether it conveys the right to use the
underlying asset for a period of time. Earlier application was allowed for entities that also apply IFRS 15
Revenue from contracts with customers.
In accordance with IFRS 16, the group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease on the basis of
the new definition of leases. Under IFRS 16, the contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
In the case of a new lease, under the new standard, the group recognises a lease liability and a right-of-use
asset measured as the present value of future payments. The amount of the lease liability to be recognised

_Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial_
_statements”)_
17


-----

depends on the underlying assumptions in relation to the features of each type of lease and any renewal or
termination options when considered reasonably certain at the time of recognition, as well as the discount rate
applied. The lessee shall recognise interest on the lease liability and depreciation of the right-of-use asset
separately. The lessee shall also remeasure the lease liability should certain events occur, such as a change
in the lease term or a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in the reference index or rate.

As mentioned earlier, the group’s consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019 were the first set
prepared in compliance with the IFRS. In accordance with IFRS 1.7, the group restated the right-of-use assets
at the transition date (1 January 2018) on the basis of an analysis of the lease contracts in place at such date.
On first-time adoption, the group applied some of the practical expedients provided for by the standard.
Specifically, it excluded leases with terms of twelve months or less and leases for which the underlying asset
is of low value. For such exempt leases, the introduction of IFRS 16 did not entail the recognition of lease
liabilities and right-of-use assets, but the lease payments are taken to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over
the lease term and the relevant liability is recognised under trade payables.
Also subsequent to first-time adoption, the group decided not to apply IFRS 16 to short-term leases and lowvalue leases, which mainly refer to rental of IT devices and sporadic rental of goods for short periods of time.

_New standards and interpretations applicable from 1 January 2020_
A number of amendments to IFRSs were adopted during the year, including the following

- Amendments to IFRS 3 revised 'Business combinations', which provides clarification as to whether a
Modifications to IFRS 3 revised 'Business combinations', which provides clarifications to determine whether a
transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition.
With regard to the distinction between the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an asset combination,
the amendments IFRS 3 revised are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2020. A business is defined as an integrated set of activities and assets that can be conducted and managed
for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends
or interest) or generating other income from ordinary activities. The acquisition of a business is to be accounted
for as a business combination under IFRS 3 revised by applying the acquisition method, which, among other
things, may result in the recognition of goodwill. Conversely, the acquisition of a group of assets that does not
have market access is to be considered an acquisition of assets (group of assets acquisition); in asset
acquisitions, the acquirer allocates the transaction price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their relative fair value and no goodwill is recognised. To date, these amendments have
had no impact on the Group.

- Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 on 'Reform of Interest Rate Reference Indices interest rates" (so-called
IBOR reform) that apply exclusively to hedging relationships directly affected by the reform of interest rate
benchmarks. The amendments provide exceptions so that companies may continue to apply hedge accounting
requirements assuming that the reference interest rate on which the hedged risk or the cash flows of the
hedged item or the cash flows of the cash flows of the hedging instrument are not changed as a result of the
IBOR reform. To date, these changes have not had an impact on the Group.

- Amendments to IFRS 16 'Covid 19-Related Rent Concessions' which introduced a practical expedient to the
section 'Lease Modifications' that allows the lessee to disregard any concessions on lease payments received
after 1 January 2020 and arising from the effects of COVID-19 as an amendment to the original contract.
Therefore, such concessions may be accounted for as positive variable lease payments without passing
through a contractual amendment. In order to be able to apply this exemption, all the following conditions are
met:

  - the concession on payments is a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction
the payments relate only to those originally due until June 2021;

  - the change in payments has left unchanged, compared to the original conditions, the same amount
to be paid or reduced the amount thereof;

######  there are no material changes to any other terms or conditions of the lease.

On 29 March 2018, the IASB published an amendment to “References to the Conceptual Framework in
IFRS Standards”. The Conceptual Framework defines the fundamental concepts for financial reporting. The
document helps ensure that the Standards are conceptually consistent and that similar transactions are treated
the same way, so as to provide useful information to investors, lenders and other creditors.
The ”'Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of Materiality” aims to clarify the definition of materiality
in order to help companies assess whether information is material and therefore to be included in the financial
statements. In particular, it is specified that information is material if it is reasonable to assume that its omission,
misstatement or concealment could influence the decisions that the main users of financial statements
prepared for general purpose financial statements make on the basis of these financial statements, which
provide financial information about the specific entity preparing the financial statements.

The adoption of the other standards and interpretations detailed above has not had a material impact on the
measurement of the group’s asset, liabilities, costs and revenue.

_New standards and interpretations applicable from 1 January 2021_
The amendments to the IFRS adopted during the year included:

- On 25 June 2020, the IASB published “Extension of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9
(Amendments to IFRS 4)” which extends such exemption until annual periods beginning before 1 January
2023 for insurance companies.

- On 27 August 2020, in light of the reform of interbank interest rates such as IBOR, the IASB published
“Interest rate benchmark reform—Phase 2” which amends the following standards:

  - IFRS 9 Financial instruments;

  - IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement;

  - IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures;

  - IFRS 4 Insurance contracts; and

  - IFRS 16 Leases.
All of the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021.

- On 31 March 2021, the IASB published “Covid-19-related rent concessions beyond 30 June 2021
(Amendments to IFRS 16)” which extends by twelve months the practical expedient introduced by the
amendment issued in 2020 under which lessees can account for rent concessions that are a direct
consequence of Covid-19 without assessing whether they are lease modifications. Accordingly, the lessees
that applied such practical expedient in 2020 accounted for the effects of the rent concessions directly in profit
or loss. Available only for lessees that had applied the 2020 amendment, the 2021 amendment is effective for
annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2021 and earlier application is permitted.
The adoption of the other standards and interpretations detailed above has not had a material impact on the
measurement of the group’s asset, liabilities, costs and revenue.

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life only comprise goodwill, while the other assets (development
expenditure, industrial patents and intellectual property, licences, trademarks and similar rights, other
intangible assets and assets under development and payments on account) all have a finite life. More
information on each item is provided below.

Development expenditure amounts to €33,882 thousand, €664 thousand and €581 thousand at 31 December
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The amount is mainly related to:

- An amount incurred by the parent and mostly refers to the Physica and Hybrid Glenoid (from 2020) products

- Intangible asset identified during PPA related to the allocation of part of the consideration transferred at the
acquisition date for TechMah Medical LLC (consolidated at 100% as per the anticipated acquisition method).
TechMah Business combination generated a goodwill and the recognition of intangible assets allocated to
development expenditure based on an assessment carried out by an independent expert. The relevant
estimated useful life is ten years (from 2021);

- Costs capitalised by TechMah Medical LLC for the development of its products which will enrich the group’s
portfolio with digital solutions designed to assist surgeons with operations. The same applies as for the
previous point regarding amortisation (from 2021).

The related amortisation amounts to €3,858, €311 thousand and €511 thousand at 31 December 2021, 2020
and 2019, respectively.

information set out by IAS 36 such as the fact that management monitors the group’s performance and takes
strategic decisions about its product offering and investments at group level.

The goodwill recognised in Limacorporate three year consolidated financial statements in relation to the abovementioned merger was tested for impairment at each reporting date. Specifically, the recoverable amount of
the group’s assets was calculated by estimating their fair value and comparing it with the carrying amount of
consolidated net invested capital at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019, in order to examine whether
recognised amounts had been impaired.
With regard to testing goodwill for impairment, the group identified a single operating CGU for its operations.
Market multiples were used as external sources of information to calculate fair value. These were obtained by
analysing listed comparable companies and were then compared to internal sources of information, i.e., the
implicit multiple calculated using the group’s actual data.

The market multiples method is used to determine the fair value of goodwill, using listed comparable
companies. These multiples are compared with the implicit multiple calculated using the group’s actual figures.
The market multiples analysis based on companies operating in sectors comparable to those of Limacorporate
(performed on the date the impairment test was carried out on seven comparable companies) provides
supporting evidence about the carrying amount of goodwill recognised in the 2021 consolidated financial
statements. This is because the market multiples (which show an average enterprise value of between 17 and
20 times gross operating profit) are higher and/or in line with the multiple obtained by comparing the group’s
actual net invested capital at the end of 2021 (i.e., including goodwill) to consolidated gross operating profit.
As a result of such checks, based on market references (i.e., market multiples) compared with the group’s
implicit multiple, no impairment indicators have been detected to date for goodwill in the consolidated financial
statements.

**[3.3] Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment and other assets amount to €81,773 thousand, €85,288 thousand and €79,713
thousand at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Changes in property, plant and equipment in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and a breakdown of historical cost,
accumulated depreciation and any cumulative impairment losses are summarised in the following tables:

Land and buildings underwent the following significant increases in the three years:

###### - in 2019, the €718 thousand increase principally refers to the costs incurred by the parent to build the
new innovation centre in Villanova di San Daniele and to expand the test laboratory;

###### - the €752 thousand increase in 2020 is chiefly due to costs incurred by the parent to build the new
clean room in Villanova di San Daniele.

###### - The €508 thousand increase in 2021 is chiefly due to costs incurred by the parent to build and complete
the new clean room in Villanova di San Daniele and to acquire land to extend the Villanova di San
Daniele production plant and build a car park for the plant.

The increase of €3,533 in plant and machinery at 31 December 2019 relates to the purchase of production
machinery and the systems built for the innovation centre completed in 2019.
Specifically, the following investments were made at the parent’s facilities:

   - two 3D printers;
   - turning centres for both the Villanova di San Daniele and the Calatafimi-Segesta facilities;

   - a milling centre.

The €1,753 thousand increase of 2021 refers principally to the construction of equipment for the new clean

room, the completion of the purification plant at Villanova di San Daniele and investments made to purchase

production machinery.

The main items of machinery purchased are as follows:

   - two actuators to expand the test laboratory;

   - two machining centres;

   - a measuring machine;
   - three presses.

At 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019, industrial and commercial equipment amounts to €36,820 thousand,
€35,489 thousand and €32,925 thousand, respectively. It mainly comprises equipment capitalised each year
and in previous years.

Other assets include office furniture and equipment, electronic office equipment, transport vehicles and cars.
The investments made in the three years (€643 thousand, €813 thousand and €608 thousand at 31 December
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively) relate to the purchase of electronic office equipment and furniture.

Increases of €1,349 thousand, €1,666 thousand and €1,284 thousand in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively,

**[3.4] Equity investments**
Equity investments amount to €2 thousand, €402 thousand and €792 thousand at 31 December 2021, 2020
and 2019, respectively.
The following information is provided on direct and indirect equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and
other companies.

_Subsidiaries_
All of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidation scope, except for Mississauga-based Lima
Orthopaedics Canada Inc., incorporated under Canadian law in October 2021 and fully owned by
Limacorporate S.p.A.. The company will begin operations in the first half of 2022.
In 2021 the decrease in investments in subsidiaries is due to Lima (Beijing) Medical Devices Co., Ltd. which
was not included in the consolidation scope in 2020 as it had only been incorporated at the end of the year
and was not yet operative. It was consolidated in 2021 when it began operations.

_Associates_
The associate Beijing Lima TXF (€790 thousand at 31 December 2009 was put into liquidation in September
2009. After an impasse with the Chinese shareholder as to how to distribute the equity resulting from the
liquidation, the company was closed and deleted from the company register in September 2020 without further
costs for Limacorporate S.p.A., which therefore derecognised this equity investment, offsetting the amount
against the liability for the outstanding share capital payment.

_Other companies_
Equity investments in other companies amount to €2 thousand and refer to CAAF Interregionale dipendenti
S.r.l., Consorzio Friuli Energia, Terra degli Elimi and CE.R.ME.T..

**[3.5] Deferred tax assets and liabilities**
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legal provision within the same tax jurisdiction.
The group recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities on the temporary differences between carrying
amounts and tax bases. The consolidation entries generated deferred taxes, chiefly relating to the:
   - elimination of intragroup profit on inventory;
   - elimination of intragroup profit on equipment and components;
   - allowance for inventory write-down;
   - derecognition of intragroup gains on the sale of assets.

The latter were calculated using the rates ruling when the temporary differences will reverse in the different
countries where the group operates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are broken down as follows at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019:

Parent’s share capital of €9,868 thousand at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 is fully subscribed and paidup. It comprises 9,900 thousand ordinary shares without a nominal amount.

Share premium reserve amounts to €14,425 thousand and did not change over the three years.

Legal reserve, amounting to €2,101 thousand at 31 December 2021, €2,101 thousand at 31 December 2020
and €1,971 thousand at 31 December 2019, increased by €130 thousand in 2020 due to the allocation of the
profit for the previous year. This reserve is not distributable.

Merger reserve, amounting to €288,261 thousand at 31 December 2021,2020 and 2019, comprises the effects
of the reverse merger between the parent and Emil Holding III S.p.A. in October 2016 on equity.

FTA reserve, showing a negative balance of €3,840 thousand at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019,
comprises the effects of the transition to the IFRS.

Capital contributions amount to €28,051 thousand, €23,088 thousand and €3,088 thousand at 31 December
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The transactions that affected this caption during the three-year period are summarised below:
I. €4,963 thousand for the contribution in kind made in 2021 by the shareholder for the acquisition of
TechMah Medical.
The contribution in kind is directly related to the shared-based payment of certain milestones regarding
the acquisition of TechMah Medical. Under the agreement signed in 2018, the subsidiary Lima USA
allocated the founding shareholders of TechMah Medical a set number of new EmilNewCo Sarl
(indirect parent of Limacorporate S.p.A. with a 100% interest) shares upon reaching set targets
regarding the development of new products benefiting the group.
The above-mentioned allocation of shares in October 2021 led to a share capital increase for
EmilNewCo and the recognition of an amount due from the founding shareholders of TechMah Medical
equal to the liability recognised by Lima USA for the contractual milestones to be settled. The two
transactions between the founding shareholders of Techmah Medical and Lima Group (EmilNewCo
Sarl, Limacorporate S.p.A. and Lima USA) have been offset using claim notes, which generated the
capital injection referred to above.
II. capital injection by the shareholder of €20,000 thousand in June 2020.

III. €3,088 thousand for the agreement with HSS (Hospital for Special Surgery). On 4 January 2019, Lima
USA and HSS (the operator of the most prestigious US orthopaedic surgery hospital in New York)
signed a collaboration agreement for the production of implants on hospital grounds, via the following
agreements:
I. a six-year lease for the premises where Lima USA will produce the implants for HSS, of which
payment for the first three years have been made by awarding HSS a fixed number of new
Emil NewCo shares and the second three years will be paid by monthly instalments;
II. a supply contract which establishes that HSS will bear the cost of any leasehold improvements
made by Lima USA and will receive a set number of new Emil NewCo shares in return.
The accounting effects of the above transaction are as follows:

###### - recognition of other right-of-use assets for €1,793 thousand, lease liabilities of €875 thousand and
other reserves of €918 thousand;

###### - recognition of greater leasehold improvement costs of €2,170 thousand with a balancing increase
of €2,170 thousand in other reserves.

negative balance of €22 thousand, €25 thousand and €27 thousand at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively.

Translation reserve, with a positive balance of €1,508 thousand at 31 December 2021, negative balance of
€335 thousand at 31 December 2020 and negative balance of €2,161 thousand al 31 December 2019, reflects
the changes in the group’s share of the equity of consolidated companies due to changes in exchange rates
of such companies’ functional currencies compared to the presentation currency of the consolidated financial
statements.

The main items making up the other reserves are as follows:

###### - the revaluation reserve, which arose from the merger of Lima S.p.A., amounts to €111 thousand and
is recognised in compliance with Law no. 413 of 30 December 1991 in relation to deferred tax on the
revalued amount of land and industrial buildings. There were no changes in the reserve during the
three-year period.

###### - other sundry reserves of €1,400 thousand, €1,399 thousand and €201 thousand at 31 December 2021,
2020 and 2019, respectively.

Retained earnings (losses carried forward) amount to a negative net balance of €11,917 thousand at 31
December 2021, a positive net balance of €565 thousand and €1,320 thousand at 31 December 2020 and
2019, respectively.

Agents’ termination indemnity is the estimated liability deriving from the application of ruling legislation and the
contractual clauses in relation to the termination of agency contracts.

Unlike accruals to the provision for risks, warranties and other provisions, accruals to agents’ termination
indemnity are classified by nature among costs for services. The decreases of the year refer to utilisations of
the provision following the termination of agency contracts and the release of the provision when not due. The
relevant liabilities were subject to actuarial calculation by an independent expert.

Other provisions amount to €2,997 thousand, €2,820 thousand and €3,281 thousand at 31 December 2021,
2020 and 2019, respectively, and include:

###### - the provision for charges of €1,761 thousand, €750 thousand and €1,263 thousand at 31 December
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively;

###### - the provision for compensation for damage caused by products of €423 thousand, €630 thousand and
€650 thousand at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively;

###### - other disputes/contingent liabilities of €813 thousand, €1,440 thousand and €1,368 thousand at 31
December 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

On 4 December 2019, the parent was notified of a preliminary assessment report following the completion of
the tax assessment by the Friuli-Venezia Giulia regional tax authorities for 2016.
On 3 February 2020, Limacorporate replied to such preliminary assessment report pursuant to article 12.7 of
Law no. 212 of 27 July 2000, asking the tax authorities to recognise the lack of grounds of some of the
allegations set out in the report and, accordingly, not to issue the assessment notices, reserving its right to
present further pleadings and start negotiations with the tax authorities.
To date, the tax authorities have not yet issued the assessment notice, which would enforce the notice, nor
have the tax authorities agreed to hold negotiations as hoped by the parent, following the comments it filed
pursuant to article 12.7 of Law no. 212 of 27 July 2000. Furthermore, based on the information available to
date (also considering the specific comments issued by the parent), the risk of losing the case is estimated as
possible. Moreover, such risk is currently difficult to quantify and is of an indeterminate amount, in light of the
conclusions made by the parent and with no negotiations being held with the tax authorities. In light of the
above, the parent decided not to make any accrual to the provision for risks.

**[3.14] Employee benefits**
Employee benefits chiefly refer to post-employment benefits recognised by the parent. These are defined
benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19 and, therefore, the relevant liabilities were subject to actuarial
calculation by an independent expert. Changes in the caption during the three years were as follows:

Financial liabilities chiefly include the bonds of €272,556 thousand, €271,136 thousand and €269,776
thousand at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
On 17 August 2017, the parent issued senior secured bonds, redeemable in 2023, for a total nominal amount
of €275 million.
The bonds have coupons based on the 3-month Euribor plus a 3.75% spread, with a Euribor floor threshold of
0.00%. They are listed on the Euro MTF market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the professional
section of the ExtraMOT market of the Italian Stock Exchange.
The coupons mature every three months on 15 February, 15 May, 15 August and 15 November each year
starting from 15 November 2017.
The bonds are measured at amortised cost and, therefore, the relevant balance is stated net of deferred
charges incurred to issue them. The following guarantees were issued in relation to the bonds:

###### - pledge on the shares of Limacorporate S.p.A.;
 - pledge on the shares of some subsidiaries;
 - pledge on some of the current accounts of the parent and some subsidiaries;
 - special lien on plant, equipment and other items of property, plant and equipment of the parent;
 - lien on certain categories of assets of some subsidiaries;
 - guarantees on some categories of assets of the parent and some subsidiaries.

In relation to the refinancing put in place in 2017, as well as the issue of bonds, Limacorporate also finalised
an agreement for a new super senior revolving credit facility for a maximum of €60 million on 8 August 2017.
The same guarantees provided for the issue of the bonds were granted for this revolving credit facility;
specifically:

###### - pledge on the shares of Limacorporate S.p.A.;
 - pledge on the shares of some subsidiaries;
 - pledge on some of the current accounts of the parent and some subsidiaries;
 - special lien on plant, equipment and other items of property, plant and equipment of the parent;
 - lien on certain categories of assets of some subsidiaries;
 - guarantees on some categories of assets of the parent and some subsidiaries.

During the three years, the parent drew down the following amounts:

###### - €47,000 million at 31 December 2021;
 - €40,000 million at 31 December 2020;
 - €22,000 million at 31 December 2019.

The interest rate applied to the facility is the 3M EURIBOR plus a 3.75% spread.
The EURIBOR floor threshold is the same as that of the bonds (0.00%).
If more than 35%(as explained in finacing agreement) of the available amount of the revolving facility is used (i.e.,
draw-downs exceeding €21,000 thousand), a covenant related to the ratio of EBITDA to net financial position

(based on the utilisation of the revolving facility), which cannot exceed 1.83, is also activated under the terms
of the contract. Such covenant was complied with at 31 December 2019 and 2021.
Due to the global health emergency which has affected the countries where the group operates, this covenant
was renegotiated in June 2020, at the time of the shareholder’s €20,000 thousand capital injection and
additional commitment for a further injection of €15,000 thousand in the event the new covenant is not complied
with. In brief, the measurement and check of the previous net financial position/EBITDA covenant was
temporarily suspended until 30 September 2021 and was replaced with a new covenant linked to simply
maintaining a minimum level of availability liquidity (€10,000 thousand), which includes the unused part of the
revolving facility itself. The new covenant is comfortably complied with at 31 December 2020.

The caption also includes the non-current portion of series of medium/long-term loans taken out, detailed as

###### - subsidised loan of €200 thousand granted by Unicredit Bank of Austria to Lima Austria in August 2020.
Like the above loans, the Austrian group company applied for this loan to offset the negative economic
effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The subsidised interest rate applied is 0.00% until August 2022 after
which it will be the 3M Euribor + 0.75%; The residual amount at 31 December 2021 is €150 thousand
(€50 thousand current);

###### - loan of €593 thousand granted by Banca Agricola Commerciale in San Marino to Lima SM in June
2011. The subsidised interest rate applied is 5% of Euribor + 2%. At 31 December 2020 and 2019, the
parent still had to repay €30 thousand and €89 thousand, respectively. At 31 December 2021 the loan
was totally refunded.

Other financial liabilities and Other loans and borrowings - both current and non-current - include mainly the
amounts yet to be paid in relation to the acquisition of TechMah Medical LLC (contingent consideration). The
liability variation depends on the payments occurred during the period and its fair value. This liability was
measured by an independent expert with reference to the acquisition date and subsequently updated at each
year end. The difference on the previous year end is taken to profit or loss under financial expense.

On 25 September 2017, the parent entered into an agreement with the agency M.T. Ortho to acquire its
business unit comprising the components organised for the marketing, sale and after-sales assistance of Lima
medical devices in Sicily and Calabria. Specifically, the business unit included:

###### - ongoing supply contracts with the healthcare facilities;
 - supply contracts under negotiation;
 - goodwill.

The consideration of €3.7 million was to be paid as follows:

###### - €740 thousand when the transaction was finalised; 
 - €2,960 thousand in six annual instalments through 2023, the payment of which depends on whether
a certain level of sales is maintained in the region until the payment is complete. During 2020, the
repayment of a total of €2,940 thousand was rescheduled. The increase in other current liabilities
compared with 2019, relating only to the portion due within one year, is linked to the renegotiation of
the agreement in late 2019, accelerating the payment of the remaining 2021 instalments of €1,645
thousand against a €20 thousand decrease in the liability and the renegotiation of the commissions in
the region.

The remaining portion of the other financial liabilities relates to the acquisition of MT Ortho:

###### - a non-current portion of €185 thousand at 31 December 2021, €185 thousand at 31 December 2020,
and € 1,850 thousand at 31 December 2019;

###### - a current portion of €0 thousand at 31 December 2021 €1,645 thousand at 2020 and €555 thousand
at 31 December 2019.

Finally, financial liabilities include lease liabilities deriving from the application of IFRS 16. The discount rate
applied in 2021 was unchanged on that used for the previous two years and for first-time adoption.
Changes in current and non-current lease liabilities from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021 are set out
below:

The performance obligation in the group’s sales contracts is satisfied at a point in time. The group recognises
the revenue when the customer acquires control to the promised asset. It does not have performance
obligations to be satisfied over time (specific analyses of the sales contracts in force over the three-year period
were performed to check that there were no performance obligations to be satisfied over time).
Revenue is stated net of discounts and allowances.

_Nature and terms of performance obligations, significant payment terms and revenue recognition criteria_
Control of products is transferred to customers when the prothesis is implanted during surgery. Once the
product has been implanted, the customer simultaneously sends a reinstatement order; when the Group
receives the reinstatement order the revenue is recorded; the Group issues invoices subsequently. Typically,
invoices are due within 60 days. Discounts are granted mainly to certain customers in Italy, Germany, the
Czech Republic, Switzerland and Turkey and they are linked to the achievement of certain sales volumes.
Given the type of business, product returns do not represent a significant stage of the sales cycle.

Revenues are broken down by geographical segment as follows:

thousand drop in realised and unrealised exchange losses.

Interest expense was recognised due to the utilisation of the revolving credit facility (€1,786 thousand, €1,653
thousand and €750 thousand for 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively), as a direct consequence of higher debt
over the three years.

**[3.30] Income tax benefit (expense)**
The caption amounts to €(4,070) thousand (benefit), €1,737 thousand (expense) and €2,018 thousand
(expense) for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

In November 2019, the parent signed a preliminary agreement with the Friuli-Venezia Giulia regional tax
authorities about the special tax regime provided under the Patent Box. Specifically, the agreement set a
special tax rate for income earned on the parent’s direct use of intangible assets for the 2015-2019 five-year
period, confirming the significant and added value that research and development activities bring to the
parent’s business. The benefit arising from the signing of such agreement was reflected in 2019 via a reduction
in the taxable income and, accordingly, the tax expense.

The main temporary differences that led to the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities are set out in

**[4.1] Operating segments**
The disclosure about operating segments was prepared in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments which
provides for the presentation of information in line with the measures adopted by the chief operating decision
maker to make operating decisions.
At operating level, the group has a matrix organisational structure split by product line, distribution channel and
geographical segment providing a coherent strategic vision of the business. This structure can be seen in the
way management monitors and directs the group’s activities. Specifically, senior management reviews the
group’s results as a whole as it does not have identifiable operating segments. Therefore, the group’s
operations are presented as a single segment for IFRS 8 reporting purposes.
A breakdown of revenue earned over the three years by product line, distribution channel and geographical
segment is shown below:

**C. Financial risk management**

The group is exposed to the following risks deriving from its use of financial instruments:

- credit risk;

- liquidity risk;

- market risk.

_Risk management system_

Overall responsibility for the design and oversight of the group’s risk management system lies with the parent’s
board of directors. This committee is in charge of developing and monitoring the group’s risk management
policies.
The group’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse any risks it is exposed to, establish
appropriate limits and controls and monitor the risks and compliance with such limits. The committee regularly
revisits the policies and related systems to align them with market developments and the group’s business.
The group aims to create a disciplined and constructive control environment through training programmes,
standards and management procedures so that its employees are familiar with their roles and responsibilities.
The board of directors ensures compliance with the risk polices and management procedures and checks that
the risk management system is appropriate to deal with risks that could affect the group.

The group’s financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, loans, trade receivables and payables,
current and non-current assets and liabilities as well as derivatives.
In its normal business operations, the group is exposed to:

_Consolidated financial statements as at and for the three years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019 (the “three-year financial_
_statements”)_

-----

market risk, mainly currency and interest rate risks;
commercial or counterparty credit risks, related to the risk of default on commercial or financial obligations by
various counterparties as part of normal business operations or lending, investment and hedging transactions;
liquidity risk, related to the availability of financial resources and access to the credit market and refers to the
need to meet the group’s financial needs in the short term.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally and essentially ensures that there are enough financial
resources to meet business development needs and that resources are suitably invested in profitable activities.

_Market risk_
Market risk can be broken down into the following components:

###### - interest rate risk, 
 - currency risk.

_Interest rate risk_
The group’s exposure to interest rate risk is chiefly related to cash and cash equivalents, bonds and bank
loans and borrowings, especially the revolving credit facility that is managed centrally. At 31 December 2021,
2020 and 2019, the group does not have any interest rate hedges. A 100bps increase in the interest rate
applied would have led to an increase in financial expense of roughly €3.3 million, €3 million and €2 million al
31 December 2021,2020 and 2019, respectively.

_Currency risk_
As the group sells its products in various countries, it is exposed to currency risk. This risk mainly derives from
sales in currencies other than the Euro, like the US dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and Australian dollar.
The group regularly assesses its exposure to market financial risks. It does not manage such risks by using
derivatives.
Its exposure in relation to foreign currency assets and liabilities is detailed in the following table (countervalue
of the respective currencies in Euro):

_Credit risk_
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument may default on a contractual
obligation generating a loss for the group. It mainly arises on trade receivables and debt instruments.
The group’s maximum exposure to this type of risk is the assets’ carrying amount.
Some of the markets on which the group operates have a higher level of risk, such as southern Italy, where
the health system is deeply in debt, southern European countries, like Spain and Portugal, and eastern
European countries, such as Croatia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where collection times are very long.
Most of the group’s receivables are due from public institutions, thus solely linked to the country risk. Moreover,
payments from public administration have improved notably in some cases in recent years thanks to measures
taken to cut public entity debt with private companies.
Credit risk is also mitigated by the fact that the group is increasing its sales in countries with shorter average
collection times. Therefore, the weight of markets with higher credit risk will be reduced.

At 31 December 2019, 2020 and 2021, the group does not have exposures with individual customers for more
than 10% of its total trade receivables. Its top ten customers account for around 6.5%, 7% and 6% of total
trade receivables at 31 December 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The amount of financial assets for which recovery is doubtful is immaterial in terms of the total amount of
receivables and is, in any case, covered by adequate accruals to the relevant allowances. The following table
shows the group’s exposure to credit risk (amounts are inclusive of the loss allowance):

**Net trade receivables at 31 December 2021** **41,111** **6,422** **5,362** **4,598** **9,396** **66,889**

The group has worked with more than 70% of its customers for over four years and the related trade
receivables at the reporting dates have not been either reversed or impaired. It monitors credit risk by grouping
trade receivables by the credit worthiness of the customers, considering whether they belong to the private or
public sector, their geographical location, relationship with the group and any previous financial difficulties.
Receivables are broken down by geographical segment as follows:

_Liquidity risk_
Liquidity risk derives from the ability to obtain financial resources at a sustainable cost to carry out the group’s
normal business operations.
The group uses the usual tools to manage current trade receivables, as well as partially using the facilities
available.
Moreover:
the group has debt instruments and credit lines to deal with liquidity requirements;
there are no significant concentrations of liquidity risk with regard to financial assets.
The table below summarises the ageing of financial liabilities at each year end on the basis of non-discounted
contractual payments:

**[4.3] Significant non-recurring transactions**
In early 2019, the Limacorporate Group and Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) – an orthopaedic hospital in
US -, announced that they are founding the world’s first 3D printing facility for custom complex implants in a
hospital setting. This innovative collaboration will set the stage to substantially increase the availability and
speed of personalised orthopaedic care for patients with complex orthopaedic conditions in the United States.
The new facility, operated by the American group company, Lima USA, on the HSS main campus on New
York’s Upper East Side, will leverage the combination of Lima’s advanced technology and experience and
HSS’s expertise in clinical care and biomechanical engineering. The collaboration will foster and accelerate
innovation in complex orthopaedic joint care resulting in new products and solutions for patients across the
US. Lima will be the registered manufacturer for all devices designed and produced at this new, state-of-theart facility, located at HSS.
The facility will initially serve hospitals in the region before making the devices available to all providers in the
US.
In June 2019, the tax authorities notified the parent that its application for the ACE (aid to economic growth)
benefit had been accepted, thus reducing tax expense for the year and subsequent years.
In September 2019, the parent was assessed by the tax authorities in relation to 2016, concluding with the
issue of a preliminary assessment report in December. Reference should be made to note [15] Provisions for
risks and charges for further details.

In November 2019, the parent signed a preliminary agreement with the Friuli-Venezia Giulia regional tax
authorities about the special tax regime provided under the Patent Box. Specifically, the agreement set a
special tax rate for income earned on the parent’s direct use of intangible assets for the 2015-2019 five-year
period, confirming the significant and added value that research and development activities bring to the
parent’s business. The benefit arising from the signing of such agreement was reflected during the year via a
reduction in the taxable income and, accordingly, the tax expense.
In October 2021 the Mississauga-based Lima Orthopaedic Canada Inc. was incorporated under Canadian law. It is fully
owned by Limacorporate S.p.A.. The company will become operative during the first half of 2022 with the aim of more
rapidly and effectively developing a potentially very interesting market

**[4.4] Guarantees**
Reference should be made to the sections on financial liabilities [3.15].

**[4.5] Related party transactions**
The group carries out transactions with the ultimate parent recognised in line with the provisions of IAS 24.
They are all financial in nature and are performed with full transparency and on an arm’s length basis. They
do not include typical and/or unusual transactions.
Details of related party transactions carried out during the three-year period are as follows:

The nature of the Senior management transactions refer mainly to the share-based payment incentives, in
particular “Virtual share plan” (see 4.7).

No other significant related party transactions took place during the three-year period.

_Transactions with Emil Holding II S.à.r.l._

The group operates in a market dominated by entities directly or indirectly controlled by the Italian government
through state bodies, agencies, related parties and other organisations (entities related to government bodies).
The parent does not carry out transactions with other entities related to government bodies, such as, for
example, the sale and purchase of goods and materials, the supply or receipt of services, leasing of assets or
use of public services.
Financial transactions with the ultimate parent are part of the parent’s normal business operations and take
place at conditions similar to those applied to transactions with entities unrelated to government bodies.
Limacorporate has purchase and sales procedures for financial services that it applies to both third parties and
entities related to government bodies.

The only non-recurring transaction with Emil Holding II S.à.r.l. during the 2019-2020 period was the €20 million
capital injection made by the ultimate parent in June 2020 to renegotiate the new covenant on the revolving
credit facility and in 2021 was the €4,963 thousand contribution in kind made by the shareholder in October
2021 as part of the transaction to invest in the subsidiary TechMah Medical Llc.. More information is available
in note [3.15] Current and non-current financial liabilities.

**[4.6] Fees of directors, statutory auditors and key management personnel**

**Total** **798           759** **1,506** **39** **(746)**

**[4.7] Management incentive plans**
In accordance with IFRS 2, the parent identified cash-settled share-based payment incentive plans for some
managers.
Assumptions about the fair value of the share-based payment plans are based on the Monte Carlo method (by
simulating the group’s EBITDA and equity value).

In previous years, the parent had defined two types of plan:

###### - Virtual share plan (“VSP”)
On 23 November 2016, the parent’s shareholders approved the 2016-2030 virtual share plan for one
of its managers. This includes the free award of options to subscribe the parent’s ordinary shares. The
manager has the right to receive a number of options each year calculated using a pre-set formula.
The plan vests on 31 December 2030 although this date may be brought forward in the case of i) an
IPO, ii) a change of control, or iii) leaver events that lead to the beneficiary leaving the parent.
The manager’s right to exercise the options vests in line with their continued employment relationship
with the events i), ii) and ii) being early exercise events.
This plan qualifies as a cash-settled plan under IFRS 2. Its fair value was calculated using market
models and the market data at the reporting dates (such as interest rate curves, historical price curves

of listed comparable companies’ shares, price volatility of listed comparable companies’ shares) as
well as non-market conditions (the probability that the above events will take place). The parent
updates the calculation each year.

###### - MPP plan
In September 2016, the parent introduced an incentive plan for some group employees who signed
agreements providing for i) the award of shares of Emil Holding II (the company that manages and
coordinates the parent) to the plan beneficiaries, ii) the granting of call options by the beneficiaries to
Emil Holding I whereby Emil Holding I can acquire the shares held by the beneficiaries if certain events
occur, iii) the granting of put options by Emil Holding I to the beneficiaries whereby the latter can sell
their shares in Emil Holding II at the same conditions set for the call option, generating an amount
equal to the difference between the amount paid by the beneficiaries (on the subscription date or
deferred to the farthest away of the exit date - the listing of Emil Holding II or a group company that
directly or indirectly holds all or nearly all of the group’s assets, the sale of at least most of the assets
or the winding up of Emil Holding II - and 31 December 2028) and the carrying amount of the shares
at the option exercise date.
The options can be exercised if one of the events occurs.
This plan qualifies as a cash-settled plan under IFRS 2. Its fair value was calculated using market
models and the market data at the reporting dates (such as interest rate curve) as well as non-market
conditions (the probability that the above leaver events will take place). The plan liability represents
the plan’s future value less the cost incurred by each beneficiary as its initial investment to enter the
plan. The parent updates the calculation each year.

These plans led to recognition of a non-current liability of €4.8 million at 31 December 2021 and benefit of
services and personnel expenses for the year of €340 thousand (respectively €5.2 million and 1.5 million for
2020 and €3.7 million and €1.1 million for 2019).

**[4.8] Events after the reporting date**
**2021**
Though 2021 did not see the back of Covid-19, vaccinations gradually spread throughout large areas of the
planet and the latest variant Omicron that hit in late autumn was less severe and lethal. This meant the
pandemic was more manageable and normality was partially restored in early 2022. The state of emergency,
at least in Italy and Europe, will probably be lifted in spring.
In relation to events after the reporting date, the growing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine exploded into armed
conflict in late February following the Russian army’s invasion of the country. Still under way, it is impossible
to predict how the conflict will evolve in the medium term. However, the group does not have any significant
direct customers in this area, with combined sales in the two countries counting for less than 0.5% of its
revenue, and has no direct suppliers there. The indirect repercussions of the conflict, on the other hand, will
see a further increase in inflation, especially in energy prices, but also in the medium term affecting certain
raw materials used by the group, with potential impacts on sales margins.
There were no other significant events after the reporting date.

**[4.9] Impacts of Covid-19 pandemic and going concern**

**2021**

2021 was dominated by the need to curb the spread of Covid-19. However, the extremely high vaccination
rates in some countries, the individual containment and protection measures adopted and the reduced number
of hospitalisations and deaths caused by the Omicron variant made the still present public health emergency
more manageable.

Indeed, as demonstrated by the results set out above and despite the resurgence of global sales falling short
of expectations, the group was able to contain its operating costs and, thus, meet very satisfactory financial
and profit targets. Together with its confirmed financial soundness, this means that the group is well placed to
cover its operating requirements and future development plans.
Moreover, based on the characteristics of its markets and the backlog of elective surgeries accumulated over
these past two years, management is confident that demand will exceed pre-pandemic levels in the medium
term and resume its previous trend, which is also linked to the demographic trend. Accordingly, pursuant to
the provisions of Banca d’Italia/Consob/Isvap document no. 2 of 6 February 2009 and IAS 1.25-26, based on
the above and on financial support confirmation from parent company EQT Luxembourg Management S.à.r.l.,
the directors believe that going concern is comfortably ensured, even in the current uncertain macroeconomic
context.
