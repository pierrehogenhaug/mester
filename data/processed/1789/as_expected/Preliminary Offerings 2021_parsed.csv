The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Maison BidCo Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the “Company”). The Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated on or around          , 2021 (the “Issue Date”). The offering of the Notes is referred to herein as the “Offering.” The gross proceeds of the Offering will be on-lent to the Company.

The Notes will bear interest at the rate of      % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrear on           and           of each year, commencing on          , 2022. The Notes will mature on          , 2027. At any time on or after          , 2023, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this preliminary offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). Prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may also redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes (as defined herein)) with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this Offering Memorandum, if at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes) remains outstanding. Prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may redeem, during each twelve-month period commencing with the Issue Date, up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued (including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. The Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase all of the outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a change of control will be deemed not to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, to the extent the Acquisition will not complete on or shortly after the Issue Date, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will deposit the gross proceeds of the Notes into a segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) in the name of the Issuer but controlled by the Escrow Agent (as defined herein) pending release to consummate of the Acquisition, and charged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee (as defined herein) on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any event within three Business Days). The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, certain regulatory approvals and the performance of certain closing actions. If the conditions to the release of the escrow proceeds have not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined herein) or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption.

The Notes will be general senior secured obligations of the Issuer, and on the Issue Date, will initially be guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Issue Date Guarantee”) by the Company. Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements, the Notes and the Issue Date Guarantee will be secured on a first priority basis on the Issue Date by (i) a charge over all of the shares in the Company on a third party limited recourse basis granted by Maison Hold Limited (“Holdco”); (ii) an assignment over structural intercompany receivables owing by the Company to Holdco; (iii) a charge over all of the shares in the Issuer granted by the Company; (iv) an English law debenture granted by the Company with respect to its material bank accounts and a floating charge over all or substantially all of its assets; and (v) an English law debenture granted by the Issuer with respect to its material bank accounts and any structural intercompany receivables owed to it by the Company and a floating charge over all or substantially all of its assets (collectively, the “Issue Date Collateral”). Within 150 days of the Completion Date (the “Post-Closing Date”), the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Post-Closing Guarantees” and, together with the Issue Date Guarantees, the “Notes **Guarantees”) by each of Keepmoat Limited, Keepmoat Homes Limited and M.C.I. Developments Limited (the “Post-Closing Guarantors” and, each of them, a “Post-Closing Guarantor” and, together with the Company, the “Guarantors”). Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements, within 10 Business Days of the Completion Date, the Notes or the Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first priority basis by a charge over all of the shares in the Target granted by the Company and an assignment over any structural intercompany receivables owing by the Target to the Company, and on or about the Post-Closing Date, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first priority basis by (i) a charge over all of the shares in Keepmoat Homes Limited granted by Keepmoat Limited; (ii) a charge over all of the shares in M.C.I. Developments Limited granted by Keepmoat Homes Limited; and (iii) an English law debenture granted by each Post-Closing Guarantor over its material bank accounts and any structural intercompany receivables owed to it and a floating charge over all or substantially all of its assets in each case, subject to customary limitations and exceptions (collectively, the “Post-Closing Collateral” and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”). See “Description of the Notes—Security” and “Description of the Notes—Notes _Guarantees.”_ The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, as applicable, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (as defined herein), and will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes.

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of subsidiaries of the Company that do not provide Guarantees. The Notes Guarantees may be released in certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The property and assets that will secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees thereof will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility on a first-ranking and pari passu basis. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), in the event of a distressed disposal of, or an enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture to be secured in priority to the Notes have been repaid in full. The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations.” The Collateral and the Notes Guarantees may be released in certain circumstances._ There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the US Securities Act or in a report filed under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “US Exchange Act”). If a US court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting language, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditor based on its report or the audited consolidated financial statements to which it relates could be limited. In addition, we have included in this Offering Memorandum unaudited consolidated financial information of the KM Group for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, which has been calculated by adding the unaudited results of operations of the KM Group for the nine months ended July 31, 2021 to the audited results of operations of the KM Group for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 and then subtracting the unaudited results of operations of the KM Group for the nine months ended July 31, 2020. The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. We have not included financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP in this Offering Memorandum. As of and for (i) the financial year ended October 31, 2019 and 2020; (ii) the seven months ended October 31, 2018; and (iii) the financial year ended March 31, 2018, our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differs in certain significant respects from US GAAP. In making an investment decision, you should rely upon your own examination of the terms of the Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and US GAAP, and how those differences could affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.4,Other Financial Information,7.4.1,,"This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios, including Contribution, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Normalized EBITDA, gross margin, Free Cash Flow, free cash flow conversion, ROCE, tangible net operating asset value, tangible net asset value, as adjusted total debt, as adjusted total senior secured net debt, as adjusted net debt and as adjusted cash interest expense (collectively, “Non-IFRS Measures”) that are not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction. - “Contribution” represents gross profit adjusted for exceptional items within cost of sales, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and acquisition fair value adjustments. - “Adjusted EBIT” represents operating profit/(loss) before exceptional items, shareholder monitoring fees, amortization of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition fair value adjustments to inventory and impairment losses of investments in associated companies. - “Adjusted EBIT margin” represents Adjusted EBIT divided by Group revenue. - “Adjusted EBITDA” represents operating profit/(loss) before exceptional items, shareholder monitoring fees, amortization of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition fair value adjustments to inventory, impairment losses of investments in associated companies, depreciation, depreciation of right-of-use assets and amortization of computer software. - “Adjusted EBITDA margin” represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Group revenue. - “Normalized EBITDA” for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 has been calculated by subtracting the Adjusted EBITDA presented in our management accounts for each of the months ending August 31, September 30 and October 31, 2020 (with certain adjustments as necessary to present on a basis comparable to the Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021) (the “October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA”) from the Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and then adding the Adjusted EBITDA presented in our management accounts for each of the months ending August 31, September 30 and October 31, 2019 (the “October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA”), as further described in footnote 9 under “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other _Financial Information.” We believe that Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July_ 31, 2021 is a measure that assists in understanding our performance during a period impacted by the market disruption caused by COVID-19 by substituting the October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA for the October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA, comprising the months of our last calendar equivalent financial quarter prior to the market disruption caused by COVID-19. Our operations during the three months ended October 31, 2020 were negatively impacted following the government imposed lockdown and the subsequent delayed ramp up on home construction and sales, before resuming normalized operations during the three month period ended January 31, 2021. As a result, we believe Normalized EBITDA is more representative of our Adjusted EBITDA performance for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and takes into account, on a highly illustrative basis, the cyclicality of our business. Normalized EBITDA presented herein is for informational purposes only. Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 might not represent what our Adjusted EBITDA would have been for the same period had the confinement measures not been implemented. In particular, Normalized EBITDA does not (i) give effect to any other event, favorable or unfavorable, that happened or could have happened during the three months ended October 31, 2020, other than the events directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic or (ii) adjust for the positive or negative effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the nine months ended July 31, 2021. The information has been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions as described herein but such assumptions do not take into account all conceivable variables and are therefore inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. In addition, such assumptions may not give an accurate or complete picture of the KM Group’s financial condition or results of operations, may not be comparable to the KM Group’s consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and undue reliance should not be placed xiii ----- upon them when evaluating an investment decision. Normalized EBITDA has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, the KM Group’s management, and has been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering Memorandum. It is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any future period, is not prepared in the ordinary course by the Issuer, has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. - “gross margin” represents Contribution divided by Group revenue. - “Free Cash Flow” represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures and investments. - “free cash flow conversion” represents Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. - “tangible net operating asset value” represents net assets adjusted for goodwill, acquisition intangible assets, tax, cash, loans and borrowings, lease assets and liabilities and pension assets/liabilities. - “Adjusted tangible net asset value” represents tangible net operating asset value less net debt and net other non-operating items. - “ROCE,” or return on capital employed, represents the Adjusted EBIT for the relevant twelve month period divided by the average of the opening and closing tangible net operating asset value, expressed as a percentage. We believe that ROCE is a meaningful measure of our profitability and cash generation for individual sites, regions and the business as a whole. We believe that ROCE is therefore helpful for understanding the performance of our business. - “as adjusted total debt” represents the total principal amount of debt as if the as if the Transactions had taken place on July 31, 2021. See “Capitalization.” As adjusted total debt excludes unamortized fees in respect of Existing Senior Term Facility and obligations of the KM Group under the Company PIK Loan. - “as adjusted net debt” represents as adjusted total debt, less the as adjusted cash and cash equivalents set forth in “Capitalization.” As adjusted net debt excludes unamortized fees in respect of Existing Senior Term Facility and obligations of the KM Group under the Company PIK Loan. - “as adjusted total senior secured net debt” represents the as adjusted total debt of the KM Group secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral, excluding any liabilities secured by a fixed charge or mortgage on Collateral subject to a floating charge, less any cash and cash equivalents as set forth in “Capitalization.” The calculation of as adjusted total senior secured net debt assumes that the Revolving Credit Facility has not been drawn as of the Issue Date. - “as adjusted cash interest expense” represents the cash interest expense on as adjusted total debt as if the Transactions completed as of August 1, 2020. As adjusted cash interest expense excludes obligations of the KM Group under (i) the Company PIK Loan and (ii) all of our lease liabilities. - “Completions” represent the number of new build homes that we have sold over the applicable period. For private homes this is the number of legal completions during the period. For Registered Provider homes this represents the equivalent number of units sold, based on the proportion of work completed under a contract during the period. - “ASP” represents average selling price. - “Land pipeline plots” include secured and preferred developer plots. Secured plots means that land on which we have a contractual right, a conditionally exchanged contract to develop. Preferred developer plots means that land where we have been selected as the preferred developer or has won a bidding process, but contracts have not yet been exchanged. - “Asset Turn” is defined as Group Revenue divided by average opening and closing tangible net operating asset value. xiv ----- - “Gross Development Profit” represents gross profit adjusted for marketing costs and exceptional items within cost of sales. - “Gross Development Margin” represents Gross Development Profit divided by Group revenue. Our calculation of Gross Development Margin includes certain projections, estimates and assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change. Gross Profit Margin is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to reflect the current returns on any particular site or for the Group as a whole or the potential returns that could be achieved on any particular site or the Group as a whole. Our calculation of Gross Development Margin may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. - “forward order book” represents the aggregate reserved position at any point in time, including secured positions with Registered Providers as well as private reservations by individuals. Our forward order book includes (i) plots that are contracted for but homes have yet to be completed on the lot and (ii) plot reservations for which contracts have yet to be exchanged. Where presented, unaudited consolidated financial information of the KM Group for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 is a Non-IFRS Measure. We believe that the presentation of Non-IFRS Measures may or could enhance investors understanding of our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that EBITDA-based measures are commonly used by investors. Our Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. For example, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA includes certain adjustments which some companies might not include in the definition of “adjusted EBITDA.” Our Adjusted EBITDA and related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction and should not be considered substitutes to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction. Our definition of Normalized EBITDA includes adjustments which we feel are appropriate to reflect the negative impact on our performance following the market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, though which may not be appropriate for other companies or industries. Our Non-IFRS Measures have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” under the Indenture. Some limitations of EBITDA-based measures include: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and - amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and the Non-IFRS Measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - they do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and - other companies in our industry may calculate Non-IFRS Measures such as adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. Accordingly, you should rely on our IFRS results, as applicable, and use these Non-IFRS Measures only in a supplemental manner to evaluate our performance. Key performance indicators and other non-financial operational data included in this Offering Memorandum are not part of our financial statements and have not been audited. Our use or computation of these indicators may not be comparable with the use of computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. None of the key xv ----- performance indicators or other non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum should be considered in isolation or as a substitute to any indicator of our operating performance, cash flows or other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS or the accounting measures of other jurisdictions. Key performance indicators and other non-financial operational data included in this Offering Memorandum are not part of our financial statements and have not been audited.

In respect of financial data set forth in the main body of this offering memorandum, a dash (“—”) signifies that the relevant figure is not available, while a zero (“0”) signifies that the relevant figure is available but has been rounded to zero. By contrast, no such differentiation has been made in respect of the financial data set forth in the financial information section of this offering memorandum beginning on page F-1.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.6,IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers),7.6.1,,"IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) was issued in 2014 and was endorsed by the EU in 2016. IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 (Revenue). IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We adopted IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) from April 1, 2018 in accordance with the fully retrospective transitional approach without using the practical expedients for completed contracts or for modified contracts. We have applied the expedient allowing both non-disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, and an explanation of when it expects to recognize that amount as revenue for all reporting periods presented before the date of initial application. Under IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), revenue is recognized based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This can lead to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. The majority of our revenue and profit, including revenue from open market sales, continues to be recognized on legal completion. For those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from Registered Providers of housing, revenue is recognized based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) also sets out the requirements for recognition of noncash consideration as revenue. Previously, where we entered into arrangements to provide housing to Registered Providers at below open market value in exchange for discounted land from partners, the associated housing unit revenue was recorded at open market value. IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) does not permit this, as the exchange transaction (land discount from partner) is not received directly from the customer (the Registered Provider) and so does not meet the criteria of non-cash consideration. This change has the impact of reducing reported revenue. Accordingly, the revenue recognized in respect of these housing units will be equal to the cash consideration received from Registered Providers, with no open market value adjustment. There are a limited number of developments where the eventual buyer of the affordable units is the same entity as the land xvi ----- vendor. In these instances, the discount received represents non-cash consideration, which continues to be recognized as revenue. The financial information presented herein for the financial year ended March 31, 2018 has been derived from the restated comparative information contained in the audited financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2018 as restated to give effect to IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers).",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.7,IFRS 16 (Leases),7.7.1,,"Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 (Leases) replaced IAS 17 (Leases) and the related International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee’s and the Standards Interpretation Committee’s interpretations, and results in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. IFRS 16 (Leases) is effective for fiscal years commencing on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted if IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) has also been applied. We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) from November 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, comparative information is not restated and the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 is recognized in retained earnings at the date of initial application. In particular, as a consequence of IFRS 16 (Leases) our total assets and liabilities are expected to increase as the right of use asset associated with leases and the corresponding liability, which were previously treated as operating leases, are recognized on the balance sheet. In addition, operating lease expenditure has been reclassified and split between depreciation and finance cost, and as a result, our EBITDA is expected to increase. Prior to November 1, 2019 we accounted for Leases under IAS 17 (Leases). As a result the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the seven months ended October 31, 2018 and as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 are not directly comparable to our audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019 with respect to the treatment of leases. IFRS 16 (Leases) was effective for the financial year ended October 31, 2020. The impact of adopting IFRS 16 (Leases) for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was the recognition of right of use assets of £8.0 million and lease liabilities of £8.6 million on transition in respect of offices, company vehicles, site plant equipment and show homes. The impact on adjusted EBIT for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was £0.6 million. This information may not be indicative of the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases) on our total assets, total liabilities and EBITDA for the next financial year or any future period. xvii -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are one of the UK’s oldest and most experienced partnership housebuilders, with “5-Star Homebuilder” status awarded in 2021. We are focused on creating sustainable communities in places where people want to live, and we specialize in the delivery of affordable and high quality homes, principally targeted at first-time buyers. Headquartered in Doncaster, England, we operate across England and Scotland through nine operating regions. We are a top ten UK housebuilder, measured by the number of homes sold, including delivering 4,035 homes in our financial year ended October 31, 2019. Unlike traditional housebuilders, our business model is based on partnerships with entities interested in seeing an increase in supply of homes as well as those with demand for our product. These partners are primarily land owners (such as Homes England, Local Authorities and private land owners) or Registered Providers, which include the traditional not-for-profit and the newer for-profit entities that are registered with the Regulator of Social Housing to provide affordable housing. We engage each of our key stakeholders in residential projects by establishing, aligning and prioritizing their needs and successfully delivering their objectives. We have built our reputation by aligning our approach to our partners’ objectives regarding the sourcing, procurement, planning and delivery of successful, affordable housing developments that create significant social value. We believe that we are the original partnership-focused housebuilder in the United Kingdom, having worked with over 200 partners to date, with many of these relationships enduring for over 20 years. Our partnership model allows us to have a high degree of certainty over our land pipeline, with sufficient land secured for six years of development based on our future development plans and on 2019 home deliveries, while also typically allowing us to defer payment until milestones are met. We are also able to minimize development and planning risks by partnering with land owners through the early stages of a development project. Coupled with the relatively low land costs for the affordable homes that we target, we are able to operate a capitallight business model relative to traditional housebuilders, and generate relatively strong cash conversion and return on capital employed (“ROCE”). In the financial year ended October 31, 2019, the last full financial year prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ROCE was 32.8%. We focus on developing urban and suburban locations where there is an inherent demand and supply imbalance for new homes. We aim to meet this demand through our five core standard house type ranges. This standardization allows efficiency in procuring materials and construction, increased certainty of cost and timing of delivery, and assists in establishing optimal site layout mix based on demand and our partners’ preferences. We are continually working with new technologies that underpin and refine our designs. We are committed to deliver a range of affordable housing, predominantly for open market sale, social housing and shared ownership – which provides us with a higher degree of market resilience over the long term due to generally consistent demand from first-time buyers and well-funded Registered Providers. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, approximately 74% of our sales were on the open market (which includes sales to private customers as well as elective sales to Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a site), with the remaining approximately 26% of our sales comprising sales to Registered Providers that are contracted at the outset of development of a site, including but not limited to those contracted to satisfy Section 106 obligations. Approximately 87% of our open market sales in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 were to private sale customers, of which approximately 76% were to first-time buyers (first-time buyers accounted for 76% during the financial year ended October 31, 2019). In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, approximately 45% of our total sales, including 67% of sales to first time buyers, involved the use of the United Kingdom government’s (the “Government”) Help to Buy (“HTB”) scheme. We believe that first-time buyers provide more resilient structural demand than the typically discretionary and cyclical home-mover segment. ----- ----- opportunities as a result. We believe our financial results in recent quarters demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our business model. Our focus on partnerships provides us with an attractive financial model, benefitting from typically lower land values, attractive (and often deferred) payment terms, the potential for additional elective deals with Registered Providers (beyond sales in connection with Section 106 affordable housing obligations) and access to grant funding to optimize returns.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,"Strong Fundamentals Underpinning the UK Housing Sector, Supported by a Favorable Government Policy Environment","The supply of housing in the UK market has lagged behind demand and the regions where we operate in particular are characterized by a structural supply-demand imbalance. The UK Government’s position has historically been that everyone should have the opportunity to own an affordable, decent home within a sustainable and mixed community. To this end, support for the housing market and first-time buyers has been a target of government policy over recent years, starting with the introduction of the National Planning Policy Framework (“NPPF”) in 2012. In its 2021 annual budget, the Government reiterated its pledge to increase the number of new homes built per annum, with the goal of delivering at least one million additional homes through this parliamentary cycle. Overall, the Government has a target to build 300,000 homes per year through the mid-2020s (as announced in the Budget 2017), and we expect there to be continued support for the housebuilding sector as the Government seeks to achieve this target. The following chart shows the number of homes completed by private sector and public sector funding, as compared to the Government target of 300,000 per year. In particular, the first-time buyer market outside of London, our core target market, is aided by a supportive structural and political backdrop promoting both home ownership and affordable housing, including through UK central Government funds, loans, grants and subsidies, which assist in both the viability of schemes and also pace of delivery. As demonstrated by the recently launched “First Homes” program, which offers firsttime buyers a minimum 30% discount on the purchase of a new build home, we expect this segment to continue to be a key focus area for the UK government in the future. This has contributed to a rise in housebuilding completions to 178,310 in England in the year ended December 31, 2019, the highest level since 2007. This is, however, far below the 300,000 per year needed in England as estimated by the UK Government in early 2021 despite the macro-economic uncertainty created by the pandemic. As household formation continues to rise and the pandemic has reinforced buyer preferences for houses over flats, we have experienced a strong recovery in 2021 to date. ----- The demand backdrop for housing remains supportive with the continued increase in UK household formation. The following chart shows the number of homes in the UK since 2011, as of June 29, 2020, with 20212039 data estimates completed by private sector and public sector funding, as compared to the Government target of 300,000 per year. (1) Office for national statistics While it is not currently known whether the HTB scheme will be extended after 2023, what modifications to any extensions may be, or if other government support for the sector may be put in place, we believe the Government will remain focused on supporting those purchasers who form our key customer base. For instance, when the HTB scheme was modified and extended to March 2023, reforms were implemented to restrict the scheme to support only first-time buyers from April 1, 2021 onwards and with regional price caps from £186,100 in the North East to £600,000 in London. As our ASP was £162,000 in the year ended October 31, 2019, we believe this modification will have little to no adverse impact for our business. Our ASP compares favorably for entry price point customers when compared to our listed peers. Further, based on our ability to navigate recent changes to the Scottish equivalent of the HTB scheme, we do not believe that any termination of the HTB scheme would have a material effect on the demand for our homes in England. In Scotland, the “Affordable New Build Scheme” remains available to larger housebuilders (including Keepmoat), though it stopped accepting new applications on February 5, 2021. The suspension of new applications has had no major impact on our performance in the region, which we believe is primarily a result of our target market dynamics, competitive entry price point and strong reputation as a 5-Star Homebuilder.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.2,We Operate in those areas of the UK Housing Market with the Highest Levels of Affordability and Resilience,"We believe that we are strategically positioned in the most attractive segment of the UK housing market, from both a demographic and a geographic perspective. Key attractions of this market segment include resilience in adverse macroeconomic environments, the greatest affordability levels in terms of income/price ratios and one of the strongest growth rates in historical and forecast volumes. This segment is also conducive to strong partnerships with land owners such as Homes England and other local authorities, as well as delivery partners, including Registered Providers, in their role as agents for the implementation of Government housing policies driven by social objectives. As a result, we have achieved consistently strong sales rates in recent years, outperforming more broadly focused housebuilders. From April 2017 to July 2021, Keepmoat has achieved an average open market sales rate per outlet per week of 0.82, which is above the broader housing sector’s average open market sales rate per outlet per week of 0.66. ----- ----- In terms of geographical footprint, we strategically focus on regions with fundamental affordability underpinned by strong customer demand and high growth rates. Each of these regions is characterized by belowaverage house prices and mortgage payments as a percentage of take home pay for first-time buyers. The average income to mortgage payment ratio for the regions we operate in is in excess of 4.0x, compared to approximately 2.0x to 2.5x for London and the South East or approximately 3.3x for the UK as a whole. Additionally, in each region, our ASP is below the regional average, leaving room for price inflation while remaining at the affordable end of the spectrum. The following chart compares our ASP with the market average in the respective regions shown below. (1) Average new build sales value from UKHPI Bulletin December 2020 (weighted average Nov ‘19 –Oct ‘20). Keepmoat Open Market Sales ASP for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 based on regional sales data. Keepmoat “South” region has been compared to the UKHPI “South East” region as the most applicable comparator based on locations served. We have a well-established presence in North England and are expanding our footprint in the Midlands and Scotland, where these regions are expected to have higher home completion volumes than the UK average in the medium term. Forecasted growth rates for ASP between 2021 to 2025 are 28.0%. in the North West, 28.0% in Yorkshire and the Humber, 23.9% in the East Midlands and 23.9% in the West Midlands, compared to an already strong UK average of 21.5%.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.3,"Our Partnership Model Carries Inherently Less Risk than the Traditional Housebuilding Model, with High Barriers to Entry and Partners that are Structurally Aligned","We are one of the UK’s leading dedicated partnership-focused housebuilders with a proven track-record and a strong reputation of delivering large scale, multi-faceted, residential-led regeneration schemes throughout England and Scotland. Unlike traditional housebuilders, we primarily develop in collaboration with partners that have some form of long-term continuing interest (either through ownership or social responsibility) in the relevant development. We are a partner of land owners such as Homes England and other Local Authorities, as well as delivery partners, including Registered Providers of affordable housing, strategically catering to structural demand driven by social objectives and Government housing policies. Partnership relationships promote effective and capital light land sourcing and site development (often with deferred payment terms correlated to the pace of site development and unit sales), as well as the ability to unlock development sites often inaccessible to traditional housebuilders. Unlike the traditional model, the partnership model offers an attractive financial profile with lower land acquisition costs, favorable (often deferred) payment terms, cash generative and competitively priced deals with Registered Providers, access to grant funding and accelerated delivery, enabling us to pursue investments with an attractive ROCE. ----- The following chart provides an illustration of the lifecycle of a development and key differences in our model. (1) Keepmoat profile based on a sample of sites. Traditional profile based on management’s experience of the UK housebuilding industry. Over the past 25 years, we have developed strong relationships with many of the largest land partners in the UK, which are predominantly public land owners but also include private land owners, and have built a strong reputation for delivery, quality and place making (i.e., creating thriving, sustainable communities where people genuinely want to live, work and play). Relationships are maintained at multiple organizational levels, which help identify future projects and facilitate successful tender processes. This results in a high volume of repeat business and a strong visibility of the order book. Long-standing partner relationships such as ours are inherently difficult to replicate for new entrants. We believe that the partnership model also has a reduced risk profile, as it is fundamentally based on a structural alignment of objectives among ourselves and our partners, which results in pragmatism and flexibility when required. As demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, working with our partners, we were able to agree a deferral of 80% of committed land spend and 97% of forecast uncommitted land spend, without losing any site investment opportunities as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.4,Operating Model with Best-In-Class Processes and Cost Structure,"We have specialized in offering a standardized product range of family homes as the optimal means of building affordable and high quality housing units, while minimizing execution risk and improving predictability of costs as well as improving construction build times. This focus on product standardization is a key differentiating element of our business model and commercial proposition to our partners, contributing to the creation of a strong brand. To facilitate standardization, we typically utilize our five standard house type ranges, catering to the requirements of private sale, sale to Registered Providers and local authorities, future mobility standards and Scottish building standards (where applicable), which assist in establishing optimal site layout mix based on demand and partner’s preferences. Although it varies from year to year, in the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 88% of our homes were built using standardized housing types. The in-house development process of our portfolio of core standard designs is based on internal feedback for saleability, buildability, customer feedback and land/commercial optimization, and is a key driver of the continued operational improvements across the Group that have resulted in enhanced operating margins. ----- Standardization of house types has enabled us to accurately reflect third party designs (such as heating, roofs, furniture and kitchens) for space and accessibility standards. These standard details allow us to promote best practices for quality, safety and precise material scheduling, optimizing waste as a result. Importantly, standard specifications facilitate forward demand planning, purchase leverage and rebate maximization. It allows contractors to bid aggressively on our projects as they have greater confidence around deliverability on cost and on time. The standardization process has also enhanced the quality of our products which, in turn, has increased customer satisfaction and reduced aftercare costs. The efficiencies across the supply chain and cost control and optimization have strengthened our ability to maintain strong margins and provide a partial defense from cost inflation pressures. This is further enhanced by our disciplined approach through all stages of capital allocation, acquisitions and cost control. Standardization has also enabled us to continue to maintain a low ASP, providing the potential to benefit from sale price increases during inflationary periods.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.5,Proven Ability to Source Land through a Disciplined Acquisition Process,"We have implemented a structured and agile land acquisition process, enabling a continued replenishment of our land pipeline that has contributed to sustained margin improvement over the last few years. As there is a lag between the securing of land and the ultimate delivery of finished product on that land, we may see benefit from this focus on land acquisition being realized over time. We have a controlled and disciplined internal land acquisition approval process, working within defined control gateways each requiring senior executive and/or Capex Committee approval. Our land approval protocol involves three stages. The Pre-Bid Capex proposal establishes the nature, suitability and targeted financial returns (for gross margin and ROCE) of the opportunity. The Capex 1 Proposal includes a review of planning, title and legal reports, site risks/mitigants and required approvals, with continued focus on delivering in line with the threshold financial returns. Finally, the Capex 2 proposal is the region’s final proposal to develop the site (including financial plan) once all legal matters and major approvals are received. We believe this rigorous land sourcing process, together with sales price optimization, build and sales management and the resulting increasing mix of higher quality and better procured sites, may all be contributing factors driving continued margin expansion. For example, for sites under development that were approved between 2017 and 2019 (excluding the North West MCI region), average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for each year of approval range from approximately 22% to 23% by year, whereas for sites either approved since 2020 or within our secured pipeline and to be approved, average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for each year of approval or for the “to be approved” category, range from approximately 24% to 25% by year or category. This is an increase from the average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for sites under development that were approved in 2016 and pre-2016, for which average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins are approximately 21% and 18%, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

The KM Group’s Adjusted EBIT increased 47.7% from £41.4 million for the financial year ended March 31, 2018 to £61.1 million in the financial year ended October 31, 2019. Inevitably, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact in the KM Group’s financial performance in 2020. However, illustrating the strength and resiliency of our business model, we generated revenues of £628.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of £73.8 million in the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 3.3% and an increase of 18.3%, respectively, as compared to the financial year ended October 31, 2019. Concurrently with this growth, we have made significant investments in structure and personnel at both regional and head office levels, creating a national platform optimally crafted to support our future growth in our target geographies. Margins have remained stable over this period, proving our ability and further potential to continue investing and increasing scale.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.1,"High Visibility on Medium Term Revenue Growth, Risk Mitigation Opportunities and Margin Improvement","Our current land pipeline reflects a strong level of land security to deliver on the business plan and continue to drive future growth, providing us with excellent forward visibility. As of July 31, 2021, there were 24,654 plots in our land pipeline, of which approximately 81% were legally secured, meaning that we have a contractual right to develop or a conditionally exchanged contract. This equates to a land pipeline of six years at pre-pandemic annual volumes. We intend to continue to leverage our strong land pipeline and high near-term land visibility to increase delivery volumes. We currently characterize five of our nine regions (the East Midlands, South Midlands, North West MCI, Scotland and West Midlands regions) as “growth regions,” and we believe these regions have significant potential to deliver additional plots within the existing regional management structure as they mature. We will target both continued growth in volume and margin improvement, as the business delivers on regional management team investments that have been made in these growth regions and benefits from the continued realization of land acquired through improved sourcing processes. Approximately 86% of our land pipeline has agreed deferred land payment terms with our partners. Of our land pipeline plots that have been legally secured as of July 31, 2021, approximately 37% represents projects that were not legally completed and there remained conditionality (e.g., planning and groundworks survey) prior to finalizing the contract. There are further risk mitigation opportunities available to us within our partnership model such as land payments made by Registered Provider partners, overage agreements, pace and tenure delivery flexibility and multi-tenure development. The benefits of these risk mitigation features have been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with our strong relationships with partners providing flexibility to recalibrate land and delivery obligations during this challenging period. Altogether, we were able to either defer or pay in alignment with plot delivery £58.4 million of £65.5 million total forecast land payments (89%) from April 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

We expect to continue to have a structured, disciplined and agile approach to land acquisitions to facilitate securing suitable land opportunities across all of our regions, who each have dedicated land acquisition teams focused on high quality land opportunities within each region’s geographical area of operation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

These relationships have been nurtured ----- over two decades and are held throughout our organizational structure and that of our partners, from executives to regional management and staff. We have a proven track record for delivery, quality and placemaking resulting in winning repeat business.

We intend to continue to focus on ensuring that our customers are supported throughout their house buying journey, meeting their expectations, and providing them with a high-quality new home. Sustainability is core to the partnership business model and we are committed to prioritizing ESG initiatives. Key stakeholders are aligned in their focus with approximately 74% of Local Authorities in the UK declaring a climate and biodiversity change emergency, with regeneration areas often more vulnerable to climate and environmental impacts. We are working with Wildscapes, which is a wildlife trust consultancy, to develop methodologies to support the delivery of a net gain in biodiversity for future developments. We are responsible for placemaking and regeneration which in turn helps create direct and indirect employment opportunities within low-income communities. We are focused on providing affordable, low carbon homes to contribute to delivering on our and our partners’ objectives of improving the environmental sustainability of the UK’s homes. We have committed to a number of near term ESG targets, including: introducing science-based carbon targets aligned to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius along with carbon performance metrics (currently anticipated to be set in late 2021); setting our decarbonisation roadmap within 12 months from July 2021, with the aim of achieving a net zero carbon position by the mid-2040s; mitigating supply chain risks and supporting our supply chain to become more sustainable; and updating our sustainability structure, providing greater oversight and focus on sustainability with the function reporting directly to the CEO and receiving greater focus from the Board. Additionally, we have well-developed and structured H&S policies, certified to ISO 45001:2018, and training programs, as reflected in our health and safety track record. We have clear policies, best practice guides and robust standards and operate a number of forward looking and backward looking metrics. We continuously seek to improve our H&S performance and approach, focusing on risk throughout all phases of a development. Our strategic objectives are centered around (i) keeping people safe and healthy every day; (ii) protecting and enhancing the environment; and (iii) being assured and informed. Each of the these strategic objectives contain a number of initiatives focused on achieving the objectives and cover, amongst other matters, active and visible leadership; managing risk effectively and proportionately; accountability, behavior and culture; capability; contemporary management systems; and key performance indicators.

As a result of program disruption and the costs of operating with COVID-19 working practices and social-distancing measures, our delivery volumes declined significantly given construction activity was significantly stalled from April through August 2020, our margins declined slightly compared to the financial year ended October 31, 2019 and our EBIT and ROCE performance eroded significantly. However, as demonstrated by our performance for the nine months ended July 31, 2021 and our forward order book, we recovered strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic by the first quarter of our fiscal year 2021 and believe that we are well positioned to deliver on our planned growth in the medium term. We have benefitted from a robust UK housing market, with a favorable mortgage environment, ongoing government support and strong demand, against the resilient economic backdrop during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the strict lockdown measures that were imposed through April 2021, for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, our Adjusted EBIT and ROCE increased 12.8% and 150 basis points, respectively, as compared to the financial year ended October 31, 2019. We believe our financial results in recent quarters demonstrates the resiliency and strength of our business model. The COVID-19 lockdown restrictions imposed in March 2020 caused our financial performance to decline but did not stress our overall financial profile given the lower risk inherent in our partnership model. In addition, during the financial year ended October 31, 2020, £24.4 million in partner payments were deferred, representing approximately 80% of our total commitments, which illustrates the flexible land creditor profile we maintain. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA and October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA have been extracted from the accounting records of the KM Group with such adjustments as necessary to present on a basis comparable to the Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, and not prepared on the same basis as our financial year end and are not prepared in accordance with IFRS. PwC has not audited, reviewed, compiled, or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to this data. Accordingly, PwC does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Such information has been derived from KM Group’s accounting records. Our preliminary estimates are based on a number of assumptions and adjustments that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change. While we believe these results and estimates to be reasonable, our actual results could have varied from these estimates and these differences could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information. (B) As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the confinement measures imposed by the Government from March 2020, construction and home sales activity was significantly impacted in the period, which continued during the three months ended October 31, 2020. As a result, our historical results of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2020 do not reflect what the performance of our business would have been had such confinement measures not been implemented. Our operations during the three months ended October 31, 2020 were negatively impacted following the government imposed lockdown and the subsequent delayed ramp up on home construction and sales, before resuming normalized operations during the three month period ended January 31, 2021. In order to assist in the comparability of our results of operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 as compared to prior and future periods, we present herein “Normalized EBITDA” for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021. We believe that Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 is a measure that assists in understanding our performance during ----- a period impacted by the market disruption caused by COVID-19 by substituting the October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA with October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA, comprising the months of our last calendar equivalent financial quarter prior to the market disruption caused by COVID-19. By the first quarter of our fiscal year 2021 the housing market had rebounded and our operations had normalized. We believe Normalized EBITDA is more representative of our Adjusted EBITDA performance for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and takes into account, on a highly illustrative basis, the cyclicality of our business. Normalized EBITDA presented herein is for informational purposes only. Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 might not represent what our Adjusted EBITDA would have been for the same period had the confinement measures not been implemented. In particular, Normalized EBITDA does not (i) give effect to any other event or market and economic conditions or factors, favorable or unfavorable, that happened or could have happened during the three months ended October 31, 2020 or (ii) adjust for the positive or negative effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the nine months ended July 31, 2021. (10) As adjusted total debt is calculated as the total principal amount of debt, as if the as if the Transactions had taken place on July 31, 2021. See “Capitalization.” As adjusted total debt excludes unamortized fees in respect of Existing Senior Term Facility and obligations of the KM Group under the Company PIK Loan. (11) As adjusted net debt represents as adjusted total debt, less the as adjusted cash and cash equivalents set forth in “Capitalization.” As adjusted net debt excludes obligations of the KM Group under the Company PIK Loan. (12) As adjusted cash interest expense represents the cash interest expense on as adjusted total debt as if the Transactions completed as of August 1, 2020. As adjusted cash interest expense excludes obligations of the KM Group under (i) the Company PIK Loan and (ii) all of our lease liabilities. (13) As adjusted total senior secured net debt represents the as adjusted total debt of the Company secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral less any cash and cash equivalents as set forth in “Capitalization.” As adjusted total senior secured net debt excludes any liabilities secured by a fixed charge or mortgage on Collateral that is subject to a floating charge securing the Notes, which include £10.2 million of development loans as of July 31, 2021. The calculation of as adjusted total senior secured net debt assumes that the Revolving Credit Facility has not been drawn as of the Issue Date.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

(4) Open market sales rate represents the average number of open market reservations taken per sales outlet per week over the applicable period. (5) Land pipeline plots represent secured and preferred developer plots. Secured plots means that land on which we have a contractual right, or a conditionally exchanged contract to develop.

(6) Aggregate pipeline plots as of March 31, 2018 and October 31, 2018 reflected the inclusion of a significant partner framework agreement, comprising approximately 6,000 plots. Following due diligence as preferred developer, it was determined that the deliverability of framework sites and their viability to achieve targeted financial returns was in doubt. Consequently, the framework was removed from the land pipeline, in line with our approach of only including schemes with a high certainty of delivery at required financial returns. (7) Asset Turn is defined as Group revenue divided by average opening and closing tangible net operating asset value. (8) ROCE, or return on capital employed, represents the Adjusted EBIT for the relevant period divided by the average of the opening and closing tangible net operating asset value, expressed as a percentage. We believe that ROCE is a meaningful measure of our profitability ----- and cash generation for individual sites, regions and the business as a whole. We believe that ROCE is therefore helpful for understanding the performance of our business. The following table provides the calculation of ROCE for each relevant period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

The Issuer was formed on September 7, 2021, for the purpose of issuing the Notes offered hereby. The Company was incorporated on July 23, 2021 for the purposes of facilitating the Transactions. The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Company has no material assets or liabilities, does not have any revenue generating activities of its own, and has not engaged in actions other than those related to its incorporation and in preparation of the Transactions. As a result, no historical information of the Company is included in this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer conducts no business operations of its own and, as of the Issue Date, will have no material assets and its only material liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness (including its obligations under the Notes) and, as of the Completion Date, its only material assets will be its rights and claims under the Proceeds Loan.

The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for the financial year ended March 31, 2018 has been derived from the restated comparative information contained in the audited financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2018 as restated to give effect to IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with _Customers). See note 26 to the financial statements for the seven months ended October 31, 2018 and_ “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers).” In addition, information below includes certain unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for the KM Group as of and for the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2021. The historical consolidated financial information of the KM Group for the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2021 is unaudited and has been calculated by adding the unaudited results of operations of the KM Group for the nine months ended July 31, 2021 to the audited results of operations of the KM Group for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 and then subtracting the unaudited results of operations of the KM Group for the nine months ended July 31, 2020. The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the confinement measures imposed by the Government, construction and home sales activity slowed significantly in the period which continued during the three months ----- ended October 31, 2020. As a result, our historical results of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2020 do not reflect what the performance of our business would have been had such confinement measures not been implemented. In order to assist in the comparability of our results of operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 as compared to prior and future periods, we present herein “Normalized EBITDA” for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021. We believe that Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 is a measure that assists in understanding our performance during a period impacted by the market disruption caused by COVID-19 by substituting the October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA for the October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA, comprising the months of our last calendar equivalent financial quarter prior to the market disruption caused by COVID-19. Our operations during the three months ended October 31, 2020 were negatively impacted following the government imposed lockdown and the subsequent delayed ramp up on home construction and sales, before resuming normalized operations during the three month period ended January 31, 2021. As a result, we believe Normalized EBITDA is more representative of our Adjusted EBITDA performance for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and takes into account, on a highly illustrative basis, the cyclicality of our business. Normalized EBITDA presented herein is for informational purposes only. Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 might not represent what our Adjusted EBITDA would have been for the same period had the confinement measures not been implemented. In particular, Normalized EBITDA does not (i) give effect to any other event, favorable or unfavorable, that happened or could have happened during the three months ended October 31, 2020, other than the events directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic or (ii) adjust for the positive or negative effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the nine months ended July 31, 2021. The summary historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum was prepared in accordance with IFRS. The information below is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future periods. The financial data below also includes certain Non-IFRS Measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction. The Non-IFRS Measures are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction and should not be considered substitutes to other indicators of the KM Group’s operating performance, cash flows, or any other measure derived in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” The following summary historical financial information also includes pro forma financial information which have been adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions (i) on as adjusted cash interest expense as if the Transactions had been completed on August 1, 2020, and (ii) on as adjusted total debt, as adjusted total senior secured net debt and adjusted net debt as if the Transactions had been completed on July 31, 2021. The pro _forma financial information is for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or to be indicative_ of the consolidated results of operations or financial position we would have reported, had the Transactions been completed as of (i) August 1, 2020 for the purposes of the calculation of as adjusted cash interest expense and (ii) July 31, 2021 for purposes of the calculation of as adjusted total debt, as adjusted total senior secured net debt and as adjusted net debt, nor does such pro forma financial information purport to project as adjusted total debt, as adjusted total senior secured net debt, as adjusted net debt and as adjusted cash interest expense at any future date. The _pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable but may differ materially from actual amounts. The financial information presented for the interim periods or prior years is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,"We are dependent on the UK housing market and subject to deterioration of the UK economy, brought about by uncertainty, loss of consumer confidence, higher interest rates, increasing unemployment or other factors, which could lead to decreased affordability, reduced demand for housing and falling house prices.","We operate and generate our revenue exclusively in the UK. As such, our results are highly dependent on conditions in the UK housing market and general macro-economic conditions in the UK. Historically, the strength of the UK housing market has been linked to that of the UK economy as a whole, which in turn is influenced by both European and global macro-economic conditions, all of which have been cyclical in the past. The following factors (among others) could lead to decreased affordability, reduced demand for housing and fluctuations in house prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects: - changes in the economic environment (for example, following Brexit) and macro-economic uncertainty created thereby; - reduction in gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth; - increases in unemployment rates; - reduction in consumer and business confidence; - changes in Government housing support and other regulations; - social and industrial unrest; - adverse changes in the availability and cost of credit; - changes in interest rates; and - tax rates (for example, income tax, value added tax (“VAT”), stamp duty and council tax). Historically, significant changes in the UK economy have had a significant effect on demand for housing. For example, the economic weakness experienced in the UK following the global financial crisis in 2008 caused a significant decline in demand for residential property. The declining demand led to a sharp decrease in the number of residential property transactions in the UK, with the value of new housing construction orders in the UK (in constant prices and seasonally adjusted) falling by approximately 51% between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, according to the Office for National Statistics (the “ONS”). Furthermore, the average UK house price decreased from £259,699 to £216,000 between 2007 and 2009, according to Nationwide. Adverse changes in the macroeconomic climate of the UK could negatively affect our sales volumes or the prices for which we sell houses. The UK economy has and may continue to be affected by periods of political and market uncertainty in Europe and globally, driven by, for example, weaker manufacturing output, ongoing trade tensions, the US/China trade war and global health pandemics, such as COVID-19. The longer that any such changes or uncertainties continue, the more likely it is that UK economic growth will slow. Global GDP is estimated to have fallen by 3.5% in 2020, due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with UK GDP ----- declining 9.9% in the same year. There continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK GDP growth and unemployment rates, particularly as furlough and other support measures wind down over the course of 2021. A deterioration of the UK economy could negatively affect our ability to achieve our targets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. While macroeconomic factors broadly affect the UK construction market as a whole, housing trends in the UK have also varied significantly by region due to various other factors including regional employment trends, regional differences in the cost of living, regional differences in population growth and demographic trends, the perceived desirability of living in different areas of the country and differences in land and house prices. In the future, should the UK economy stagnate or contract, the variations between regions in the UK may become more pronounced, and housing projects in any of the areas in which we operate may suffer a greater adverse impact relative to those in other regions. For the financial year ended October 31, 2020, we derived 63% of our revenue from our North Division and 37% of our revenue from our South Division. While decreases in house prices can have an adverse effect on our revenues, increases in house prices can also have an adverse effect on revenues to the extent that they result in a deterioration in affordability, as our operations are primarily focused on serving first-time buyers and building homes on the more affordable end of the housing market. Additionally, the segment of the UK housing market in which we operate and the success of our partnership model is largely dependent on investments undertaken by third parties in both the public and private sectors. The level of investment by the public and private sectors is in part connected to general economic conditions. There can be no guarantee that current investment trends in our industry will continue in the coming years, that market conditions will not stagnate or deteriorate or that future austerity measures will not negatively impact the budgets and spending decisions of our clients. If conditions limit investment by the public and private sectors, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,"A majority of our business is secured or supported either directly or indirectly from various Government sources, and changes in local or Government funds, loans, grants or subsidies, or changes to or the discontinuation of mortgage assistance schemes or equity loan schemes (including in particular Help to Buy) could significantly impact our business.","Our focus is to sell affordable homes, particularly to first-time buyers. We made 76% and 74% of our private sales to first-time buyers in the financial years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The firsttime buyer market is aided by a supportive structural and political backdrop for affordable housing outside of London, including through UK central Government funds, loans, grants and subsidies, which assist in the viability of our schemes. Since 2016, the Government has increased its focus on providing additional new homes through a number of policy statements and initiatives, including: - an increase in capital funding for the Affordable Homes Programme; - a £1 billion loan scheme to support small and medium enterprise (“SME”) home builders; - an extension of the Government’s Help to Buy scheme and funding; and - additional capital for various funds, including the Housing Infrastructure Fund, the Land Release Fund and the Planning Delivery Fund. Our sales have been particularly supported by Help to Buy, a Government equity loan scheme designed to encourage home ownership in the UK. The Help to Buy program provides assistance to purchasers of newbuild homes in the UK by reducing the minimum down payment required from the purchaser to 5% of a property’s value and providing an equity loan of up to 20% (or 40% in London) of the property value. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, the Help to Buy scheme provided assistance to approximately 67% of our open market customers to purchase a new home. The Help to Buy scheme has been modified and extended to March 2023. However, as of April 1, 2021, the scheme now only supports first-time buyers and imposes regional price caps ranging from £186,100 in the ----- North East to £600,000 in London. As a result of these reforms, non-first-time buyers who previously would have been able to secure funding through the Help to Buy scheme are no longer eligible to do so, which in turn could have an adverse impact on our home sales. In addition, the Help to Buy scheme remains subject to future regulatory changes, including to applicable eligibility criteria. There can be no assurance that the Help to Buy scheme will be extended after 2023 or, if it is extended, how it may be modified. Similarly, there is no assurance that any other similar Government-backed program will continue at current levels, or at all, or that lenders will participate in them. Any changes to the Help to Buy scheme may reduce the availability of Government funding of mortgages, which in turn may reduce demand within the homes market. We occasionally utilize public sector funding at some of our sites, in the form of grants and loans to support delivery and acceleration of housing outputs. For example, we have accessed a Home Building Fund loan, a Government fund that supports new homes being built in England. This loan arrangement was entered into in March 2019. We occasionally rely on public sector grants from Homes England and Local Authorities. Grants from these sources may make certain sites economically viable to develop, where such development would not otherwise have been economically viable without the support from these authorities. The absence of any such grants in the future could result in a loss of certain development opportunities. Additionally, the Affordable Homes Programme is a program created in 2010 to provide grant funding to support the capital costs of developing affordable housing for rent or shared-ownership sale. In connection with the next round of the Affordable Homes Programme (2021-2026), Homes England will be making available approximately £7.5 billion of funding to deliver up to 130,000 affordable homes outside of London by March 2026. We believe that this funding will be a key source of liquidity for Registered Providers (one of our principal customer bases for the sale of homes), and therefore any changes to or disruption in the provision of grants under the Affordable Homes Programme could have a material adverse effects on our results of operations. This is particularly true of our MCI business, which works exclusively with Registered Providers. The duration and availability of funding for all of the programs referred to above remain subject to change. In the future, governments and/or local bodies may change their priorities and programs. For example, authorities may reduce or amend mortgage assistance or investment support schemes, or may undertake welfare reforms that may impact funding stability for housing associations and Local Authorities. Any reduction or discontinuation of Government investment, Government funding or Government-backed home purchase assistance programs may make it more difficult for our core first-time buyer customers to afford homes, which could in turn make it more difficult for us to sell homes and may force us to either lower prices or source other forms of mortgage support for customers, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.3,"Our operations, including our operational performance and the welfare of our staff, may be impacted by the spread of COVID-19.","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and measures imposed by the Government to restrict economic and business activity in response, have had and may continue to have a significant impact on our operations. In particular, our business and financial performance in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced a significant reduction in our delivery volumes and profit margins as a result of program disruption and added costs resulting from compliance with government guidelines on working practices and social-distancing. Although we undertook certain remedial actions to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporarily furloughing employees, temporarily reducing the pay of the executive board and senior management and accessing Government support, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our operations. In light of Government guidance, we temporarily closed our UK sites and offices from mid-March to mid-May of 2020, resulting in significantly lower trading when compared to prior and subsequent periods. We delivered total completions of 2,460 homes in the financial year ended October 31, 2020, which represented a 39.0% reduction from the 4,035 homes completed in the prior financial year. Over the same period, our revenue decreased by 37.5%, to £406.0 million for the financial year ended October 31, 2020, from £649.8 million for the prior financial year. Government-mandated quarantines, self-quarantines and staff illness may also result in key staff being absent from work going forward. Any renewed suspension of our business operations at our trading sites may affect our overall business and results of operations. A prolonged economic downturn from the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could also result in us reducing our workforce or incurring charges by way of staff long-term sick pay. ----- The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and liquidity will depend on numerous evolving factors that are unpredictable, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, and the impact of the pandemic on global economic activity, unemployment levels and financial markets, including the possibility of a global recession and volatility in the global capital markets which, among other things, may increase the cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, even as COVID-19 conditions begin to improve and restrictions are reduced or lifted, we may not regain our operational momentum. Suppliers may reduce or suspend their manufacturing operations as a result of the effects of COVID-19, and therefore may be not be able to supply our products or services in a cost effective or timely manner, if at all. Additionally, COVID could have an impact on subcontractors ability and speed to remobilize from the pandemic, potentially restricting the supply of labor required to deliver construction on site. See “—Our customers and suppliers are exposed to risks associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic _and its ramifications on the wider UK economy and the home building industry.”_ Furthermore, there may be future waves of COVID-19 or similar diseases that lead to additional quarantines with limitations on activity and movement. During the first lockdown that began in March 2020, there was limited guidance from the Government as to whether the house building industry could continue operations, which resulted in many housebuilders, including Keepmoat, ceasing building activities altogether for a period of time. The reintroduction of restrictions or a lack of guidance from the Government regarding the activities allowed during the course of a future wave of the pandemic could have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK housebuilding industry has experienced certain material and services shortages, including a limited supply of bricks and available subcontractors, which have in turn increased our build costs. If these or any other shortages are sustained in any significant manner, they could result in delays to construction or a further increase in the cost of our materials and services. A broader economic downturn in light of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in reduced construction activity, lower demand for homes and increased incidence of customers’ inability to pay their accounts, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has ended. Moreover, economic hardship for some segments of the population, combined with social distancing and quarantine orders that restrict individuals’ ability to engage in “non-essential” commercial activity (including construction activity in some instances) could result in a reduction in sales. Although construction and sales activity was allowed to resume in the UK in May 2020, the outlook for the national economy remains unclear. House prices in the UK have generally increased following the first national lockdown, however some of our partners may be reluctant to embark on construction projects in the current market due to increased economic uncertainty, the possibility that property values will decrease (including due to lack of availability of debt financing), low investor confidence and concern that any economic downturn could adversely affect occupational demand and rental growth. The long term impacts of the current situation remain unknown and could impact construction and sales through, for example, more restrictive on-site working practices, mortgage availability, increased borrowing rates and reduced levels of government assistance and stimulus. It is not possible to predict accurately the duration of the current market conditions resulting from the pandemic, the extent to which COVID-19 government stimulus programs will remain in place or the timing or strength of any future recovery of the UK economy. Furthermore, we are exposed to the risk of default by customers who have agreed to purchase homes from us, suppliers who have agreed to supply materials and/or pay volume-related rebates to us under framework agreements, and others with whom we have entered into financial and other arrangements. A number of our customers and suppliers have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the worldwide pandemic, quarantine orders, financial uncertainty, disruptions to capital and credit markets and decreased demand for their services. Our exposure to default by counterparties may increase if economic conditions deteriorate. Moreover, we may be unable to procure supplies in a sufficient quantity or timely manner, especially where suppliers have shut down manufacturing sites and furloughed employees. If such supply disruptions were to occur, we may not ----- be able to develop alternative sources quickly on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In the event that any of our key customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are further adversely affected by these risks, we may face further reductions in revenue, loss of customers and disruptions in supply which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. There may also be significant fluctuations in our operating results and the results for any period may not be indicative of results for any future period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.5,"We rely on maintaining strong relationships with Local Authorities, Homes England, Registered Providers and housing associations, and these entities may be subject to reduced funding and other changes to their operations due to economic and political factors outside of their control.","Our business is based primarily on a partnership model, we primarily develop in collaboration with partners that have some form of long-term continuing interest (either through ownership or social responsibility) in the relevant development, primarily land owners (such as Homes England, Local Authorities and private land owners) and Registered Providers. As a result, our success depends on our ability to maintain strong relationships with Local Authorities, Homes England, Registered Providers, housing associations and other public entities in the UK. Approximately 79% of the plots in our land pipeline as of July 31, 2021 were being developed under the partnership model. Our partnership projects are often awarded through competitive public procurement processes and often based on the Local Authority or housing association’s perception of a developer’s expertise, design quality, reputation, price and value. Non-financial criteria, such as planning and design capability, customer service record, track record of delivering high-quality homes with minimal defects, delivery capacity and proposals to address social and economic sustainability issues, typically account for more than 50% of an applicant’s score in public procurement processes. As a result, our reputation and relationships with partner organizations are critical to the success of our business. In addition, Local Authorities often have oversight and authority over multiple potential development sites and previous Local Authority clients are thus an important source of referral and repeat business for our business. We are one of the largest strategic delivery partners of Homes England. As of July 31, 2021, we had directly and indirectly accessed approximately £450 million of funding initiatives to facilitate the delivery and acceleration of housing outputs, secured approximately 9,200 plots on 38 different sites for development through Homes England’s Delivery Partner Panel (“DPP”) and delivered or were in the process of delivering over 3,055 homes in partnership on Homes England land over the last 12 years. As a result, maintaining a strong working relationship with Homes England is important to our operations, as a deterioration of this relationship could result in both reputational and financial consequences for us. Furthermore, if Homes England were to make changes to the way it conducts the DPP or otherwise change the way it disposes of public land, this could have an adverse impact on our ability to access development opportunities through the panel or increase the competition for development opportunities. Homes England is currently preparing to launch its successor to the DPP on September 1, 2021, known as the Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System (“DPDPS”). The DPDPS is designed to modernize the bidding process through the use of a digital system which encourages new entrants to the market, and thereby simplifies the process for housebuilders to join the list of preferred developers and bid for land. With this new system, housebuilders will still have to ‘qualify’ to be able to join the list of preferred developers, but they will be able to apply to join at any time, rather than only upon renewal of the delivery partner panel once every four years, as is currently the case. We have submitted our application and had confirmation we have been appointed to be part of the DPDPS, which is not expected to be used to procure schemes until late 2021. Although DPDPS will not change the way in which schemes are procured and the legal structure under which they will be delivered on sites larger than 70 plots, the new system is likely to increase competition for development opportunities with Homes England. A material decline in opportunities sourced through Homes England could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Local authorities, Homes England, housing associations and other public entities in the UK can be subject to reduced funding and other changes to their operations and structure as a result of both economic and political factors outside of their control. This could, in turn, lead to such bodies curtailing their development activities, which would reduce the partnership opportunities available to us. Any reduction in development activities by these entities would likely have a relatively greater impact on Keepmoat than on many of our competitors given our partnership-focused business model. In addition, governmental bodies may seek to influence or change the scope or direction of Local Authorities’ activities for political reasons and, even without direct pressure, changes in national Government policy may affect Local Authorities’ decisions on local planning issues. Although all of ----- the three main political parties currently support an expansion of the supply of affordable homes in the UK, this may change in the future. In the event that there is a change of Government or economic and political factors which result in a loss of support for, or a major reorganization of, the public sector bodies with which we work, we may need to rebuild our relationships or risk losing partnership opportunities with these organizations. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these organizations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

We do not have any control over the volume and timing of partnership land pipeline opportunities, and if we are unable to continue to secure land through our partnership model with housing associations and Local Authorities, we may be unable to source land at commercially acceptable prices, on favorable terms or at all. Failure to identify suitable land, obstacles in the purchasing process, failure to manage land purchases to meet the demands of the business or increases in the costs of such purchases could mean that we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of land. Consequentially, an inability to source sufficient suitable land that meets the requirements of our business model could affect our volume growth targets. In addition, increased demand for land from our competitors may lead to increases in the prices that we are required to pay for land, which may affect the profitability of our developments. Our development activities are also affected by the planning status of the land we secure, and there may be changes in law or regulation between the time when initial planning permission is given for a particular site and the time at which we begin construction, which could cause delays, increase costs, reduce the expected rate of return or make a proposed development financially unviable. See “—We are subject to local and national _planning policies which have an impact on our operations.”_ The timing of our land acquisitions may also have a material impact on our financial condition, including the returns we are able to generate from our developments. We occasionally source plots through speculative land purchases for certain of our sites, particularly when seeking to increase presence in new regions. These speculative purchases generally involve material upfront investments of our own capital. In such cases, we may pay higher average prices for plots as we compete with other home builders for available land, which may in turn reduce our margins and return on capital employed and increase reliance on our current ongoing projects. Unforeseen events may also have a negative impact on our ability to source land, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

Within the wider housing market, we also compete for home buyers with second-hand housing sales. Our competitors include other local, regional and national home builders, and new competitors may enter the home building market. Some of these competitors may enjoy greater sales and financial resources, lower funding costs, or lower operational costs than us and their participation or entry into the partnerships market, in particular, could impair our ability to win public procurement processes at economically viable levels or at all. For example, in certain invitations to tender issued by Local Authorities or housing associations, bids that propose payment structures including deposits and/or early up front land price payments attract higher scores. To the extent our competitors are increasingly willing to make such deposits and/or early up front land price payments, we may be required to make bids on the same basis in order to win these public procurement processes, which could in turn increase our up-front costs and reduce our ability to use our preferred capital light operating model. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with housing associations, Local Authorities, subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate. Furthermore, in an increasingly competitive sales environment, there is increased risk that we may fail to sell houses as quickly as anticipated, may need to increase selling incentives or marketing costs or may be forced to sell at lower than projected prices.

During periods of weak economic conditions or strong house price inflation, prospective homebuyers’ purchasing power often depends on their ability to borrow funds and access Government stimulus programs. Our sales are therefore impacted by banks’ and other lenders’ willingness and ability to provide financing to prospective homebuyers, and the terms on which they are willing and able to do so. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 91% of our private sales buyers purchased homes with the assistance of mortgages. Any decrease in the availability of mortgages is likely to have a negative impact on our customers’ ability to purchase new houses. Changes to lending criteria such as increased checks on personal finances or the introduction of more onerous lending restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of home buyers to secure a mortgage. Similarly, changes to mortgage terms, including loan-to-value ratios and other lending criteria, average duration and interest rates are also likely to have a direct impact on demand for the housing. In particular, actual and expected monetary policies of the Bank of England, including both the speed and magnitude of any interest rate increases, are likely to have an impact on the interest rates that banks and other lenders provide. Increases in the base rate have previously had a negative impact on the UK property market because mortgage interest rates have experienced a corresponding increase, thereby making it more expensive for prospective buyers to purchase residential property. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Bank of England base rate was 0.1%. Despite the current low base rate environment, levels of mortgage lending throughout the UK remain low compared to those of certain other developed countries. Prospective buyers who can obtain a mortgage at current interest rates may also be deterred by the possibility of increased mortgage interest rates in the future. Higher interest rates (and, in turn, higher monthly interest payments) may also make mortgages unobtainable or unaffordable for some prospective buyers. Investor buyers also are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, as higher interest rates negatively affect their investment returns. The Bank of England may raise its base rate at any time, which could have an adverse impact on transaction volumes and prices in the UK’s residential property market, and may in turn reduce the volume and value of property transactions facilitated by Keepmoat and the revenue that we derive from them. In particular, the Bank of England may be compelled to increase the base rate as a result of inflation. Any increase in the costs of mortgage financing in the future may make it more difficult for us to sell homes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Future changes in Government policy and stimulus programs may also adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain Government financial assistance and mortgages. See “—A majority of our business is secured _or supported either directly or indirectly from various Government sources, and changes in local or Government funds, loans, grants or subsidies, or changes to or the discontinuation of mortgage assistance schemes or equity loan schemes (including in particular Help to Buy) could significantly impact our business.” Our focus is selling_ affordable homes to first-time buyers, and if it becomes more difficult to secure a mortgage or obtain Government financial assistance, first-time buyers may be particularly impacted, as such customers tend to require loans with higher loan-to-value ratios. Although we review a prospective buyer’s ability to qualify for a mortgage or other form of funding prior to entering into a contract and reporting the transaction as a sale, this initial review is based solely on information provided to us by the buyer, without independent verification. For reference, we do not contract on a house sale to a customer without a formal mortgage offer from a mortgage lender. To the extent there were a significant deterioration in the ability of our customers to obtain mortgage approvals or otherwise finance their home purchases, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.9,Our results of operations are affected by the cyclical nature of the home building and construction industries as well as fluctuations in the price and supply of materials.,"The home building industry tends to be cyclical and is dependent on the level of construction-related expenditures in the residential sector, public investments and public and private spending on infrastructure projects. The home building industry is particularly sensitive to factors such as GDP growth, interest rates, the cost of mortgage financing for residential construction, inflation, consumer confidence, income growth (in real terms), increases in the cost of living and other macroeconomic factors. Political instability or changes in Government policy may also negatively affect the home building industry. Moreover, demand in the home ----- building industry may be affected by demographic trends, such as ageing and declining populations in mature markets, changes in the average number of persons living in one household and domestic and international migration trends. The cyclicality of the construction industry also impacts the supply of materials and labor. During periods of market contraction, labor force participants leave the market, sometimes permanently, to retrain in other professions or move elsewhere in search of work. As markets recover, demand for labor increases and the associated impact on the cost and availability of labor can impact our business. We have several key suppliers, contractors and subcontractors in the various regions in which we operate, with whom we regularly contract to provide construction and various other services for the development of the Group’s sites. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, our top supplier, which is a materials merchant, represented 30.6% of our total expenditure for direct materials. If any of our suppliers fail to provide timely or adequate services, labor, equipment or raw materials, we may be required to source these products and services at a higher price than anticipated and may face delays at our project sites until we are able to identify an appropriate alternative supplier, contractor or subcontractor. Although we attempt to control subcontractor rate increases on our developments by fixing subcontractor prices over a phase, or part-phase, of a development through the use of “all risk” contracts and by matching subcontractor agreements to our agreements with land owners, we cannot eliminate our exposure to cyclical cost increases during development which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. See “—Our customers and suppliers _are exposed to risks associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic and its ramifications on the wider UK economy and the home building industry.”_ Although we endeavor to utilize our group supply chain suppliers across all regions, our materials suppliers vary in each region in which we operate due to the specific requirements of our projects. Although we include materials cost estimates in our tenders, materials are subject to price as well as availability fluctuations, such that even if we include flexibility in our tenders for an increase in costs, we still may not be able to source the necessary materials, which could affect our ability to deliver schemes to program. We are heavily impacted by our ability to source essential materials such as bricks and blocks. The supply of essential materials may be delayed or interrupted due to factors beyond our control, such as materials shortages or disruptions in the supply chain. See “—We could be adversely affected by uncertainty, disruption or other _consequences of Brexit.” In addition, the cyclicality of the construction industry impacts the supply of materials_ so that in times of market contraction, production is scaled back and therefore when markets recover there can be a lag in the supply chain which may lead to increased prices. Bricks, for example, can be difficult to source in the UK during periods of increased building activity and are a necessary material for our operations. A shortage in the supply of bricks in the UK typically results in the need to import bricks from overseas, which in turn may result in an increase in brick prices owing to transport costs and delays in their availability, both of which could result in significant increases in the cost of our construction projects and delay completions of sites. Any disruption to a regular supply of materials could result in project delays and increased costs if alternative suppliers are unable to provide timely replacements at competitive prices. Moreover, we may be unable to pass on any or all of the increased materials costs to our customers. Any price fluctuations or supply interruptions as a result of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.10,We could be adversely affected by the current shortage of HGV drivers in the United Kingdom.,"As has been well publicized recently, the UK is currently experiencing a shortage of heavy-goods vehicles (“HGV”) drivers, which has become more visible in the past weeks as the shortage of qualified drivers has resulted in supply chain issues impacting fuel deliveries, forcing some petrol stations to close or limit the supply of fuel available for purchase, and shortages of good deliveries to retailers. The Road Haulage Association has estimated that there could be a shortage in the UK of more than 100,000 drivers, as compared to a pre-COVID total of approximately 600,000 drivers. It has been reported that the current shortage has been partially attributable to Brexit, in which European HGV drivers have opted to work solely within EU countries or have left the UK, in part due to the increase bureaucracy and costs involved in travelling to and from the UK and an estimated 15,000 EU HGV drivers opting to leave the UK given travel restrictions imposed as part of Covid mitigation measures. The shortage has also been blamed on a suspension and delay of an estimated 30,000 HGV qualification tests in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic which resulted in a reduction of an estimated 25,000 potential HGV driver candidates passing the test in 2020 as compared to 2019. With the average age of an HGV driver in the UK of 55 years, the industry has further been vulnerable to relatively high attrition due to retirements as well as changes that have cut earnings of some HGV drivers. The Government has responded by announcing that it is considering ----- measures to recruit and train HGV drivers such as increasing the number of HGV driving tests taking place and providing temporary visas for EU HGV drivers. In addition, many employers have increased salary and have offered bonuses and new driving schemes. However, these measures will most likely take time to have an impact. While we have not yet seen any noticeable impact from the shortfall in HGV drivers, there is a risk that the current shortfall could impact our business in the event that the ongoing HGV driver shortfall results in delays in the supply chain for our raw materials or the inability of our contractors to maintain their workforce necessary to operate the heavy equipment essential for our developments, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. In addition, the shortfall in HGV drivers could increase the cost for raw materials and the costs of our contractors which could be passed on to us, leading to a potential in decreased margins. We will continue to monitor the potential impact of the shortfall in HGV drivers on our business and operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.11,"We could be adversely affected by uncertainty, disruption or other consequences of Brexit.","On January 31, 2020, the UK left the EU, entering into a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020. This process is unprecedented in EU history and the effects of Brexit remain uncertain. Uncertainty also exists over the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK, which provides for the free movement of goods between the UK and the EU and which was entered into on December 24, 2020. In particular, legal uncertainty exists around potentially divergent national laws and regulations in relation to financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, immigration laws and employment laws which may adversely affect economic or market conditions in the UK, the EU or globally. This uncertainty could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the pound sterling, which could negatively affect our revenues and the broader economic environment on which the home building industry depends. Given that substantially all of our profits are generated from the housing market, a significant negative impact on the UK economy as a result of Brexit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. In addition, we may face challenges attracting non-British EU workers following Brexit, which could impact our business and growth in the future. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 3.0% of the Group’s employees were non-UK citizens, with the majority being citizens of member states of the EU. However, EU nationals could comprise a part of the Group’s subcontractor workforce and their skillsets are such that, if Brexit materially limits the ability or willingness of those subcontractors to work in the UK, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Brexit may also put pressure on our supply chain. Most of our building supplies are manufactured in the UK and therefore are not directly exposed to future trade arrangements with the EU. However, a portion of the products procured through our network of UK based suppliers are imported from the EU. Additional requirements associated with the importation of goods from the EU could adversely impact our supply chain and increase the costs of imported construction materials. We continue to work closely with those suppliers to monitor the potential impact as the UK adapts to the new trade arrangements with the EU. Any increase in the prices of raw materials as a result of any new trade arrangements may lead to decreased margins.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.12,"Our business depends on the continued availability, viability and cost of subcontractors and other service providers.","Our business model requires us to hire third party subcontractors to provide onsite work. Although our business model has key differences from other traditional home builders, we compete within the same labor pools and changes in the labor market directly impact our costs. When activity in the home building market increases, we tend to face escalating cost pressures associated with shortages of skilled labor, particularly skilled bricklayers. Restrictions on the free movement of people as a result of Brexit and other changes to UK immigration policies could result in tight supply due to reduced availability of skilled labor from outside the UK. Poor availability of labor could significantly impact our ability to operate efficiently and deliver projects on time with high levels of partner and customer satisfaction. See “—We could be adversely affected by uncertainty, disruption or other _consequences of Brexit” and “—Our customers and suppliers are exposed to risks associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic and its ramifications on the wider UK economy and the home building industry.”_ If we are unable to find or hire qualified and reliable third party subcontractors for any of our projects, our ability to successfully complete projects on time or at all could be impaired. Furthermore if any of these third parties fail to provide timely or adequate services, labor, equipment or raw materials, we may be required to source these services and products at a higher price than anticipated and may face delays at our project sites until we are ----- able to identify an appropriate alternative subcontractor. See “—Our results of operations are affected by the _cyclical nature of the home building and construction industries as well as fluctuations in the price and supply of materials.”_ Additionally, as we have experienced from time to time in the past, we are exposed to the risk that the subcontractors that we employ may subsequently become insolvent, causing cost overruns and program delays, thereby increasing the risk that we will be unable to recover costs in relation to any defective work performed by such subcontractors. These risks are compounded during times of economic downturn, as subcontractors or any other third parties that we conduct business with may experience financial difficulties or find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to fund their deliveries or operations. We are also exposed to the risk of litigation or claims relating to breaches of contract by third party subcontractors. Furthermore, substandard work by subcontractors could result in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. If a subcontractor or supplier of goods or services fails financially or is responsible for late or inadequate delivery or poor quality of work on a project, then it could damage our reputation and result in financial losses for us. The insolvency, poor performance or other financial distress of one or more of our subcontractors may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.13,We operate in a highly regulated industry and our businesses are subject to a complex regulatory environment which may change.,"We are required to comply with national, local, and other laws and regulations and administrative requirements and policies which relate to, among other matters, planning, developing, building land use, sales, providing or arranging the mortgage market, health and safety, environment, employment, bribery (including under the UK Bribery Act of 2010), competition and money laundering. These laws and regulations and administrative requirements and policies that affect both the housing sector and ancillary sectors, often provide broad discretion to the administering authorities. Any uncertainty or changes in relevant laws, regulations or policies, or the interpretation thereof, may delay or prevent us from being able to achieve our strategic plans, give rise to substantial compliance, remediation and other costs, or could prohibit or severely restrict us from developing and building in certain locations. In addition, following on from incidents such as the Grenfell Tower fire in London in June 2017, regulation has increased around building assessments and fire safety, particularly for tall buildings. In light of such increased regulation, and the fact that we have in the past used combustible paneling material for a limited number of our properties (low-rise dwellings of no more than three stories), there is a risk that properties owned and/or constructed by Keepmoat may in future be considered to have been built with materials that are assessed to be or have the potential to be, the cause of, or a contributing factor to, the spread of fire or other destruction of properties, or compromise residents’ safety. There is also a risk that the Government, regulators or lenders could issue further guidelines in relation to combustible materials, including aluminum composite material cladding, high pressure laminate, and/or wood cladding and/or other external structures including fire safety procedures or otherwise as a result of which it may be necessary for us to remediate our buildings. If such an event occurs, there may be significant costs and expenses to rebuild the property and/or rectify the problem and our returns may decrease. Our brand and reputation may also be harmed. Each aspect of the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change. Changes, including (but not limited to) in the following areas could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results: - building regulations; - labor laws; - health and safety regulations; - local and national planning policies (see “—We are subject to local and national planning _policies which have an impact on our operations”);_ - environmental, sustainability and land use requirements; and ----- - regulation regarding provision of mortgages. In particular, we are subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies concerning the protection of health, safety and the environment. For example, in England, changes regarding Part L of the Building Regulations 2010 (“Part L”), are currently in the final stages of consultation, relating to requirements concerning the conservation of fuel and power. The proposed changes are currently anticipated to be released by the end of 2021 and are expected to come into effect from June 2022. The introduction of the changes to Part L as a transitional step towards the proposed ‘Future Homes Standard’ is a direct outcome of the Government’s Energy White Paper commitment to (i) raising the energy performance of buildings by limiting heat losses and excessive solar gains, (ii) ensuring that energy-efficient fixed building services are installed, and (iii) ensuring that the building owner is provided with the information required to maintain the building and its services. Reducing carbon emissions for new build properties remains high on the Government’s and Local Authority partner’s agenda and plays a large part in the design and construction of new build properties. The carbon emission reduction targets set by current Part L standards, alongside the industry’s modern-day good practice standards for air quality, acoustics and overheating, encourage building designers to consider more complex design solutions with bespoke user operational assumptions. If these changes are not reviewed and implemented in a timely manner, there is a risk that we may be non-compliant with the changing building regulations. In addition, changing building regulations are likely to have an impact on our underlying construction costs, with potential additional costs incurred to meet the requirements of increasing standards. The proposed Future Homes Standard is in the early stages of consultation as part of a commitment by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to ensure all new homes reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by over 75%, through low carbon heating and “world-leading levels of energy efficiency” by 2025. The Scottish Government is also going through a similar process of reviewing and consulting on proposed changes to current building regulations to significantly reduce the carbon emissions of new homes, so the same risks apply in Scotland as well. Local authorities are already empowered under the Planning and Energy Act 2008 to drive local agendas for sustainability and may ask on this basis for a variety of standards to be applied, including the Zero Carbon Emissions homes standard. This standard is higher than that of the proposed Future Homes Standard and in advance of the current Government roadmap. The above proposed changes could have a significant impact on housebuilder operations and will affect new and, potentially, existing sites (to the extent existing sites are under development at the time the changes take effect), subject to any transitional arrangements and/or accommodations for existing sites that may be put into place. The proposed Future Homes Standard will also include the development of unproven gas free solutions and there is therefore the risk of reputational damage for housebuilders if solutions fail to work as intended and create high levels of energy usage and running costs for customers. Delivery may also be affected as supply chains need to be developed for low carbon energy solutions. In addition, the Government has introduced a set of principles and guidance for the UK construction industry titled ‘Biodiversity Net Gain’. This initiative is designed to encourage developers to incorporate appropriate natural habitat and ecological features to offset the effects of the development in order to stem the loss of biodiversity through development and restore ecological networks. Compliance with these principles and guidance could result in an additional cost to us. Furthermore, the nature of the principles and guidance could result in a disadvantage to the development of brownfield sites, which represent a significant part of our business.

While we attempt to mitigate this risk by taking reasonable steps to ensure that our risk management and financial and operational procedures, controls and systems are appropriate for our businesses, there is no guarantee that significant unanticipated costs will not arise. If we fail to accurately assess expected costs, revenue or risks on a particular contract, then we may fail to achieve our expected returns. Our returns depend on costs being controlled and projects being completed on time. For example, cost overruns, whether due to inefficiency, poor design, faulty estimates, insufficient oversight, omissions, failure to use systems or comply with our processes, unforeseen technical conditions, cost escalation ----- for materials (such as timber framing, bricks, concrete, polymer and steel) (including due to inflation), and/or cost overruns by (or increased rates of) subcontractors or other factors, can result in a lower return on a project. Should significant unanticipated costs arise, they could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, business prospects and financial condition. In addition, failure to follow best practice guidelines could mean that projects are not delivered on time or do not meet agreed quality, appropriate health and safety or environmental standards and therefore do not meet customer expectations and may give rise to contractual or other liabilities. Our most significant costs are our subcontractor and supplier costs, and we rely on local and regional subcontractors from a variety of trades. Our subcontractors generally provide us with services on the basis of fixed-term, fixed-price contracts based on agreed specifications while our suppliers generally agree to make deliveries on the basis of pre-agreed prices. However, although we budget construction costs for each site before construction begins, building and construction costs can increase above anticipated amounts as a result of unforeseen events, which may result in the pre-agreed contractual prices not applying even where such arrangements are in place. We may face additional costs or delays related to, among other things, unexpected technical challenges, changes in development specifications, exceptional weather conditions that delay work, labor shortages, accidents during construction, the insolvency or poor performance of a subcontractor, environmental factors, changes in consumer preferences (leading to the need to change design once construction has already begun) or new regulations or legal requirements. For larger projects, these risks are inherently greater. If circumstances change, a lower profit or a loss on a project may result. In addition, if a subcontractor’s or supplier’s cost estimates or quotes provided to us are incorrect, we may incur additional costs or be required to source products and services at a higher price than anticipated, as well as face delays at our project sites if the estimate is incorrect by a large enough margin that the project is better served by finding an alternative contractor or supplier. These unforeseen events could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. A number of the contracts we enter into in connection with the development of our sites include certain delivery milestones. If delays to these projects lead to a failure to meet deadlines, it could result in a breach of contract for which we could be liable. The typical approach that we adopt when circumstances arise which may prevent us from meeting delivery milestones is to negotiate with our counterparties to seek to amend the contract as necessary. However, there can be no assurance that such counterparties would be amenable to such changes. Failure to meet delivery milestones could affect our reputation and future prospects, expose us to additional costs and result in contractual penalties or the calling of surety bonds, where applicable, that may impact our profit margins and result in the termination of contracts. Furthermore, any delays or underperformance in our projects may lead to conflicting demands on resources allocated to other projects. Also, for some projects, we may be required to build commercial spaces and mixed-use facilities, areas that are not part of our core business and expertise and therefore pose additional execution risks during construction. The failure to meet project deadlines and targets, in either the construction or sales process, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Worksites are inherently dangerous places and operating in the home building industry poses certain health and safety risks. Some of our operations are conducted at sites in which residents are in occupancy which adds additional risk to the inherently dangerous nature of a worksite. Any significant accident or health and safety failure could result in significant harm to any person present, including any current resident or member of the general public at or near the worksite. There can be no assurance that a major accident or safety incident will not cause significant bodily injury, physical harm or death of any person present or nearby. Any failure in health and safety procedures or performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure which results in a major or significant health and safety incident may be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result, including significant compensation payments and fines, and may lead to operational failure. Furthermore, such a failure could also generate significant adverse publicity and have a negative impact on our reputation and our ability to win new business (in particular with respect to entering into partnerships with public bodies, which is a key part of our strategy), and may expose management to personal criminal liability, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.16,Our results of operations are affected by seasonal effects.,"Our business is, to a certain extent, dependent on weather conditions and is subject to seasonality. Historically, our revenues and levels of working capital vary during the course of the year due to higher volumes of completions taking place in certain months of the year. As a result, our debt profile has grown and contracted over the course of the financial year, consistent with certain seasonal trends. Typically, the majority of our reservations for open market sales are made in January to March and August to October (with the latter correlated to the start of new school years). Our ability to manage the timeline from the engagement and planning phase to the exchange of contract and legal completion is, therefore, one of the factors that affects the timing of completions. Although we generally have a significant degree of flexibility in managing the phasing of completions and typically aim to stagger the timing of our completions to the extent practicable, the impact of weather on building activity and plot delivery has increased the likelihood of a peak in completions in the late summer and early autumn. In addition, prior to the change of the KM Group’s financial year end from March 31 to October 31 in 2018, divisional efforts to achieve targets and maximize sales for the financial year end led to a peak of completions in March. This had an effect on our results of operations for the financial year ended October 31, 2019, as our incentive scheme for that financial year remained tied to an end date of March 31. However, we do not expect this to have an impact on our financial results in any subsequent years. For the financial year ended October 31, 2021 we have amended our incentive targets to include an additional measure tied to half-year targets, in order to achieve a more levelled number of completions throughout the financial year. The above factors may lead to volatility in our quarterly financial results. These factors that affect the phasing of completions through a financial year tend to result in a peak in the number of plot completions, and accordingly revenue and profit, to the last quarter of each financial year. Results of a single fiscal quarter or half year might therefore not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a full financial year and may not be comparable with the results in the other fiscal quarters or half year. Factors that affect our peak selling seasons can have a disproportionate impact on our performance in a particular period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.17,We are subject to local and national planning policies which have an impact on our operations.,"Local and national planning policies have an impact on the financial performance of housing development. Our ability to obtain the necessary and timely planning permissions is dependent on our ability to meet the relevant regulatory and planning requirements, including detailed planning consents and technical approvals. Planning policies can restrict the availability of new land for which suitable planning permission is available and closely control how land is developed. For example, planning permissions can prescribe specific conditions on matters including density, types of housing and availability of car parking spaces. The estimated number of plots and the economic feasibility of development represented by our land may also be reduced due to planning considerations. As of July 31, 2021, we did not have planning permissions (detailed or outline) for approximately 21% of our land pipeline of 24,654 plots. Although we have generally been successful in obtaining similar planning consents in the past, there can be no certainty that we will obtain planning permission for schemes which currently lack them on a timely or cost-effective basis, or at all, and the final permission that we obtain may vary significantly from the assumptions made at the time of acquisition. For example, the gross development value of the site may be lower than anticipated, or the costs to complete development of the site may be higher than anticipated, potentially causing significant deterioration in a project’s value. Certain planning authorities continue to be under-resourced, affecting their capacity to manage applications and develop local plans. Additionally, the planning processes for many of our projects involve public consultations, which may result in adjustments to the preferred development plan, adverse planning outcomes or negative publicity. We may also be required to make significant expenditures on community infrastructure and facilities and provide a minimum amount of affordable housing as a condition of receiving planning permission, as well as provide other community benefits and payments due under the Community Infrastructure Levy. Any failure to obtain planning permissions in line with our development plans or at all may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Additionally, we are subject to the risk of non-compliance with planning conditions or planning obligations connected with planning consents. If we are found to have not complied with these planning conditions or planning obligations, our development could be deemed unlawful or subject to service of enforcement notices or, in severe cases, result in an inability to sell affected plots. ----- While the Group has developed policies and procedures to comply with existing requirements, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change. For example, in 2012, the NPPF was published which was aimed at, among other matters, simplifying planning and ensuring local communities are the keystone of the planning system. The NPPF underwent a substantive revision in July 2018, resulting in more than 80 reforms, and was further updated in January 2021. These changes introduced wide scale updates relating to sustainable development, including references to certain parts of the United Nations’ SDGs, which may impact our operations and strategy in this area. Other amendments to the NPPF that have been proposed relate to plan-makers being required to align growth and infrastructure, improvements in the environment and the mitigation of climate change (including by making effective use of land in urban areas) and adaption to its effects. The proposed changes to the NPPF that concern design quality, new local Design Codes and new timescale policy for larger-scale developments may cause some practical transitional difficulties, as councils, developers and local communities grapple with the creation of new codes and procedures, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Furthermore, the UK has recently completed a ‘Planning for the Future’ consultation, which could lead to significant changes to the planning process. The ultimate aim of this consultation is to simplify the process for obtaining planning permission. However, the introduction of new planning law would be subject to the interpretation and implementation of Local Authorities which could introduce uncertainty into the process. The planning reform is currently being reviewed by the new Secretary of State, which is likely to delay its introduction. Additionally, there has been significant discussion in the media and among certain politicians in the UK relating to “land banking,” a practice whereby a person or entity obtains land but does not develop it or develops it many years after its purchase. Detractors of “land banking” argue that the practice contributes to inflated real estate prices by limiting the amount of land available for sale in a given area. The Company can hold real estate for long periods before obtaining planning permission, resolving technical constraints, developing the land and selling it. While we do not believe we are engaged in “land banking,” as we generally seek to develop our sites immediately once detailed planning consent and all conditions are discharged (subject to market conditions and any legal or technical impediments), developing large sites requires an extended period of time and our development plans sometimes include developing on a phased basis. Any change in legislation aimed at forcing land owners to develop or sell their real estate holdings within certain prescribed periods (e.g. “use it or lose it” policies) or which impose additional requirements or taxes on outline planning consents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. In June 2021, the UK Government launched a new initiative called “First Homes” aimed at making home ownership attainable for local people and key workers who are first-time buyers. This new tenure of home ownership is expected to be incorporated into planning law in the near future and will become part of a local authority’s affordable housing policy. This tenure of home ownership will allow people to purchase a home at a minimum 30% discount to market value in perpetuity, subject to eligibility criteria. This requirement will be part of the affordable housing obligations of a planning permission (Section 106 agreement) for a site and the costs associated with it will be deducted from the land value. The same percentage discount must then be passed on with the sale of the property to future buyers (who must also be first-time buyers). The initial sale must be at a price no higher than £250,000 (or £420,000 in Greater London) after the discount has been applied. Changes made to the planning system to support this initiative now require that First Homes properties should account for at least 25% of all affordable housing units delivered by developers through planning obligations. However, as this initiative is in the early stages of implementation, the longer term impact of the initiative and any additional changes made to the planning system in relation to it are not yet known.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

These operations include, among other things, evaluating the purchase of the site, conducting environmental, title and other due diligence investigations, designing the layout and technical aspects of the development, sourcing consultants, materials and subcontractors and managing subcontractors, contractual and statutory commitments. While we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that our procedures, systems and controls are appropriate for our businesses, errors by employees, consultants or subcontractors, failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements, failings or inadequacies in internal control processes, material or equipment failures or natural disasters or the failure of external systems including those of our suppliers or counterparties or statutory bodies, could result in operational losses that could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and relationships with customers. ----- In addition, our existing compliance processes and controls may not be sufficient to prevent or detect non-compliance, wrongful practices, fraud and violations of law by our employees, contractors, customers, intermediaries, consultants, joint venture partners or sales agents. We may have limited control over such parties’ actions due to the nature of the business relationship. If any such parties receive or grant inappropriate benefits or engage in corrupt, fraudulent or other unfair or illegal business practices (including, without limitation, tax evasion, fraudulent tax schemes, anticompetitive conduct, bribery, corruption, money laundering, modern slavery or breaches of consumer protection laws), we could incur or become subject to significant financial losses, legal sanctions, penalties, or reputational damage. In addition, we could lose relationships with public sector entities, our partners (including public sector partners) and customers, and those parties may therefore be entitled to terminate their contracts with us. In particular, as much of our business involves tendering for Government contracts that are awarded on the basis of both financial and non-financial criteria (including compliance), compliance issues may prejudice our ability to participate in or win such competitive bidding processes for a significant period of time. See “—Our business depends in part on a strong image and reputation, and any _negative impact on our image and reputation could adversely affect our business.” For example, in 2019/2020 we_ conducted a record keeping audit and review of the types of our development projects that qualify as “Estate Agency Work” pursuant to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (the “Regulations”) and as a result require us to conduct Know Your Customer (“KYC”) procedures for these activities in compliance with the Regulations. We reviewed our internal anti-money laundering processes and procedures with the assistance of an outside adviser, and found that application of the Regulations affected a wider range of development projects than originally envisaged and approximately a quarter of developments projects at that time. Following the review, we made a series of changes to our internal policies and procedures which included going beyond the requirements of the Regulations and expanding our KYC procedures to all customers, of which we notified the HMRC in June 2020. As we expand, we may also be exposed to new clients, suppliers and subcontractors. Although we have longstanding relationships with many of our partners, there can be no guarantee that our systems and procedures will insulate us from errors in site valuations, failure to identify material issues in the due diligence process or errors in the design process (including those that result in failure to comply with statutory or regulatory requirements). Additionally, any delay in responding to changes in these laws and regulations, particularly in light of evolving standards and potential new implementing legislation, may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements. Monitoring and ensuring best practices for our risk management and internal controls may become increasingly expensive for us in the future, and such risks may be more acute when we undertake larger-scale projects or during periods of intense activity. Our internal controls and procedures, policies and our risk management systems may be unable to adequately address all such risks of non-compliance, which could have a material negative impact on our reputation, business activities, financial position and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Our legal interest in the sites in our land pipeline can take the form of a freehold interest in the land or alternatively take the form of a development lease or license (which provides us with development rights and exclusivity). On sites where our legal interest takes the form of a development lease or license and we have defaulted on that site, we could be forced to forfeit our development rights and exclusivity over that site, retaining no residual interest in the land. Conversely, traditional housebuilders that buy their sites and plots with an upfront land payment typically receive the freehold interest in a site, which they retain until the individual homes are sold. Through our partnership-focused business model, we enter into a variety of arrangements in order to access plots for development, including conditional land purchase contracts, development agreements, overarching framework agreements, leases and building licenses. Under conditional land purchase contracts, our obligation to purchase the land is generally subject to the receipt of planning consent that is acceptable to us. As there is uncertainty regarding whether the conditions in such contracts will be satisfied, and the timing thereof, these commitments are not recognized as liabilities on our balance sheet unless or until the applicable conditionality is removed or it becomes reasonably likely (in our estimate) that we may receive the requisite ----- planning consents and satisfy the necessary conditions. To the extent such contracts become unconditional, we will need to commit funds to complete such purchases. Additionally, the plots in our land pipeline over which we hold title are often the subject of security, including legal charges or parent company guarantees granted in favor of the vendor to secure the performance of our obligations under a development agreement. Similarly, for the majority of plots in our land pipeline, our only rights in such plots are those granted pursuant to comprehensive development/framework agreements that we enter into with vendors (which do not confer rights to proceed with development without a separate development agreement). Accordingly, in the event that we fail to deliver a scheme or otherwise breach our obligations under our development agreements, our vendors may enforce their security or terminate our rights under such agreements. Any extinguishment of rights in the plots in our land pipeline may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

We have engaged, and expect to continue engaging, in various direct marketing activities to source customers to buy our housing units. As a result, we are subject to data protection legislation (including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679), as it forms part of the law of the United Kingdom by virtue of the EUWA (the “GDPR”)) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (the “UK Data Protection Act”). Non-compliance with the GDPR or UK Data Protection Act, or technical defects resulting in a leak or the misuse of such data, could result in damage to our reputation and otherwise harm our business. The GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018, and was immediately binding across all Member States of the EU, is a privacy regime regarding the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data. The GDPR requires companies that process personal data about EU subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations related to, for example, (i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security and confidentiality; (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability); (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing; and (iv) the rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, a right of access, the right to rectification and the right to erasure. The GDPR requires companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies or types of data. Although we have implemented measures to comply with the GDPR, we cannot ensure that we remain fully compliant with its obligations under the GDPR. Non-compliance may be met with significant penalties including fines of up to 4% of total annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher), depending on the type and severity of the breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease processing). Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business and the failure to comply with these laws could subject us to significant fines and sanctions. In addition, we do not currently have specific data security insurance coverage and cannot guarantee that our general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data security systems.

Furthermore, uncertainties can arise as a result of differences in interpretation or application of existing tax law. Any change in our tax status, in taxation legislation or its interpretation, or in HMRC practice, could affect the value of property we hold, the average selling price of homes, potential sales and post-tax returns.

Any such change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. ----- Due to the size and scope of our business, there are a number of matters that HMRC might examine in detail for any given year. Our potential exposure and the likelihood of HMRC raising a challenge in connection with any matters is difficult to assess.

As of July 31, 2021, we had £18.2 million in surety bonds and £74.9 million of infrastructure bonds outstanding. We have obtained facilities to provide the requisite volume of surety bonds to meet our current needs, and currently have substantial headroom under those facilities. However, further growth may require that we obtain additional surety facilities. Our ability to obtain additional surety bonds, whether from the NHBC or other providers of bond lines, primarily depends upon our financial rating, past performance, management expertise and the capacity of the surety market. For example, when negotiating additional surety bonds with the NHBC, consideration is given to the number of plot registrations completed over the prior four-year period, the group’s rating with the NHBC and the ability to demonstrate how existing bonds are being managed and released in a timely way (for example, bonds covering roads and sewers works on site are released when they are progressed towards adoption by the Local Authority highways department and water utility companies). A number of factors could limit our ability to obtain appropriate levels of performance bond coverage, including (i) our ability to maintain our current “premium” NHBC rating (ii) changes to our claims record (iii) any changes to surety providers’ requirements or policies (iv) the failure of a surety company, particularly where we cannot get the necessary consent from the issuer’s lenders, and (v) the market’s capacity to provide bonds sufficient for our growth, which was restricted from 2008 to 2011, when surety bonds in the UK became difficult to obtain and their costs increased as a result of the financial crisis.

However, we have in the past sold, and in the future may sell, certain homes as leaseholds. With a freehold property, the buyer acquires the building and the land on which it stands. With a leasehold property, the buyer only acquires the lease from the freeholder for a fixed period of time, often between 90 and 999 years. After the lease expires, the buyer has no further legal interest in the property. Leaseholders are typically required to pay annual ground rent to the freeholder of the land on which the property sits. Additionally, with the sale of apartments customers will also have to pay a service charge for maintenance of common areas. Dependent on how much of the communal space (green areas) on a development site is adopted for maintenance by a local authority, a customer may also have to contribute to an estate service charge on maintained parts of the overall development. In addition, leaseholders may face restrictions in relation to, or need to receive permission before, making certain changes to the property over and above estate restrictions, with permission fees being payable as a result. Furthermore, the leaseholder may be required to pay fees upon the occurrence of certain events. We sold 4% and 5% of our homes as leaseholds in the financial years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result of Government’s changes to the current Help to Buy scheme, for a customer to be eligible to use the scheme all houses must be sold freehold and only apartments can be sold leasehold, with the lease terms being customer and not freeholder focused. We are now selling houses freehold on all of our sites, with the small number of apartments we sell being leasehold. Following concerns about the fairness, clarity and presentation of some leasehold contract terms in the consumer sector (which could lead to people incurring unanticipated costly fees over a long period or having to abide by onerous terms), the Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”) launched an investigation in June 2019 to determine whether purchasers are being treated fairly when buying a leasehold home. The investigation examined two key areas: (1) potential mis-selling, which examines whether individuals who have bought a leasehold property are given the information they need to fully understand the obligations they are taking on (including, for example, the requirement to pay ground rent over a certain period of time, or whether they have an accurate understanding of their ability to buy their freehold); and (2) potential unfair terms, which examines ----- whether individuals are having to pay excessive fees due to unfair contract terms (including, for example, administration, service and “permission” charges and ground rents that double after a certain period of time). In connection with this investigation, the CMA wrote to certain companies across the UK home building sector (including certain developers, lenders and freeholders – but not Keepmoat) asking for information to better understand about how leaseholds are sold and managed, and the terms their contracts contain. Following the CMA’s review of the material provided by market participants, the CMA issued an updated report in February 2020, highlighting their key areas of concern in relation to leasehold sales. These areas included: (1) ground rent, both in terms of the method of increase (in particular doubling ground rents but also increases by reference to the retail price index); (2) the impact that ground rent increases might have by virtue of the 1988 Housing Act (as arrear of ground rent could become grounds for a mandatory possession order); (3) the mis-selling of leasehold houses (in particular in relation to a lack of information or the stage at which that information was provided); (4) the level of permission and consent fees; and (5) deficiencies in checks and balances in the sales process to protect customers. On September 4, 2020, the CMA opened cases against certain companies in the UK housebuilding sector (which did not include Keepmoat) in respect of possible breaches of consumer protection law in the residential leasehold sector. These cases were based on possible instances of mis-selling and potential unfairness of certain leasehold contract terms. On March 19, 2021, the CMA issued consultation letters to two of those companies in relation to possible breaches of consumer protection law in the residential leasehold sector. The letters outlined the CMA’s specific concerns regarding the potential unfairness of terms that double ground rent every 10 or 15 years and asked the developers to take steps to address this point. The Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Bill, which was introduced by the Government on May 12, 2021, will eliminate the charging of ground rents on new long residential leases and introduce civil penalties for freeholders that do not comply with this legislation. Under the bill, the Government will reform the process of enfranchisement valuation leaseholders must follow to calculate the cost of extending their lease or buying their freehold. The Government will abolish marriage value (being the increase in the value of the property following the completion of the lease extension, reflecting the additional market value of the longer lease), cap the treatment of ground rents at 0.1% of the freehold value and prescribe rates for the calculations at market value. The Government will also introduce an online calculator, further simplifying the process for leaseholds and ensuring standardization and fairness for all those looking to enfranchise. The Government’s leasehold reform proposals, when implemented, will only apply in England, although existing legislation does currently apply in both Wales and England. Scotland operates a separate regime for interdependent units as there are very few leasehold properties in Scotland. Any potential changes to the current regime regarding leasehold properties, including any retrospective application or any breach of consumer protection laws by the business in respect of leasehold properties, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

As a result of our partnership model, we typically do not hold large land banks for long periods of time awaiting development, and instead have invested significantly in relatively lower value brownfield sites (which represented 73% and 72% of our legal completions in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 and the nine months ended July 31, 2021, respectively). However, we, like other home builders, are nevertheless subject to the risk of declining values. The valuation of a property development project or land is inherently subjective due to the individual nature of each property and is influenced by a number of factors. Changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws (including in relation to building regulations, taxation, mortgage availability and planning), political and economic conditions, the condition of financial markets, the financial condition of customers, tax regimes and interest and inflation rate fluctuations all mean that valuations are subject to uncertainty and adverse macroeconomic events and other unforeseen events could result in write-downs of our build WIP and land. There can be no assurance that the net realizable value of land in our financial statements, including the historical financial information included in this Offering Memorandum, will reflect the actual sale prices achieved of either the land itself or any developments built thereon. Land parcels, building lots and housing inventories are illiquid assets, meaning that they may not be easily sold and converted into cash and that any sale may not be capable of being completed quickly without ----- accepting a lower price than may be otherwise offered, and we may not be able to dispose of them efficiently or at all if the Group or the housing market and general economy are in financial distress.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.25,"Ownership, leasing or occupation of land as well as home building carries potential environmental risks and liabilities, including liability under claims for damages as a result of use of hazardous materials, including asbestos.","Environmental legislation imposes strict and retrospective liability for cleaning up contaminated land, watercourses or groundwater on the person causing or knowingly permitting the contamination in circumstances where such contamination is causing, or where there is a significant possibility of it causing, significant harm to people or the environment. As a result, we may be liable for the costs of investigation, remediation or removal of hazardous or toxic substances located on, under or in a property that we currently or formerly owned, leased or occupied, irrespective of whether we caused or knew of the pollution. The impact of such laws, regulations and policies can vary greatly from site to site, depending on, among other things, the scope of work undertaken, the site’s environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site. Environmental laws, regulations and policies may give rise to substantial compliance or remediation costs and requirements, and delay, prohibit or severely restrict development at our sites. We also could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines, penalties and third party claims for personal injury or property damage as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, such laws, regulations and policies. We routinely acquire properties on the basis that we accept all contamination risk associated with the property, and often provide vendors with indemnities covering any liabilities which the vendor may face under environmental laws following the sale. The costs associated with the management of such substances, or the costs of defending against environmental claims may be substantial, and our recourse to the contractors that perform our remediation work may be restricted by contractual limitations, the lapse of time or the insolvency of such contractors, among other factors. The presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate such substances properly, may also adversely affect our ability to sell the land or, where relevant, borrow using the land as security. As a substantial proportion of the Group’s developments are on brownfield sites, we are subject to an increased risk that some of our development projects are located on land that may have been contaminated or rendered geologically unstable by previous use. For example, at our Nightingale Road site, where we plan to build 372 homes in partnership with the Derby Council, a report prepared for councilors warned that land contamination could affect the project’s financial viability and completion date. The report classified the risk as “moderate risk (remediation works to be completed).” We are currently in the process of remediating the site under license with independent competent consultants monitoring the work being undertaken. It is expected that following completion and verification of the remediation in accordance with the planning permission (including remediation strategy), the site will be classed as having been remediated to the high standard required for the sale of residential homes. However, if the site is not classed as having been remediated to such standard, we would be obliged to undertake remedial work to address any defective work. Although we aim to carry out appropriate due diligence before acquiring properties, any deficiencies in our due diligence process could result in our failure to identify all major constraints and risks. In addition, following legal transfer of the land to us, we bear public liability risk as well as associated maintenance and health, safety and environmental risks. Contaminants resulting from historical operations have been detected at some of our development sites, one of which was the Nightingale Road site. This is not unusual for brownfield sites and as such, our business approach is to acquire these sites and remediate them to the standard required for residential development. Although we do not currently expect any remedial obligations to have a material effect on our financial condition, we could incur substantial additional costs as a result of additional contamination that is identified or additional obligations that are imposed at these or other sites in the future. We are particularly susceptible to this risk where historical off-site migration of contamination has occurred prior to our acquisition of a site, which has not otherwise been identified as part of the legal or technical due diligence process. Laws and regulations may also impose liability for the release of certain materials from land into the air or water, including asbestos, and such release can form the basis for liability to third persons for personal injury or other damages. It is unlikely that such claims would be fully or partially covered by our present or future insurance. See “—We may _be subject to increases in insurance premiums or fail to secure or maintain adequate insurance coverage.”_ ----- As a home building business with a wide variety of development related activities, we could be liable for future claims for damages as a result of our past or present use of hazardous or potentially unsafe materials (including materials that are not currently deemed unsafe but in the future may become known to be hazardous or unsafe). When beginning work at a site, we are exposed to the risk of various liabilities, including negligent and non-negligent damage to third party assets, local planning violations and health, safety and environmental incidents. For example, when we enter a site, we may inadvertently damage third party assets such as underground cables, sewers or pipes on a negligent or non-negligent basis. For example, certain work site vibrations may affect properties nearby and certain excavation procedures may cause collapses on third party land. We have also been subject to claims in which our former employees, employees of our subcontractors and third parties have successfully claimed damages in relation to hazardous materials and other environmental and health and safety matters. Although we carry third party liability insurance where we are responsible for policy excess only on covered claims, and to date no claims have been declined by insurers, there can be no guarantee that additional claims will not result in significant costs or that they will be covered by insurance in the future. Historically, asbestos was used as a building material by the construction industry and exposure to asbestos and inhalation of asbestos fibers can lead to a number of diseases. Although we have not been subject to any claims of this nature to date, if claims related to exposure to asbestos arise at any of our sites, such claims could give rise to material liabilities.

We may also unknowingly source materials from suppliers that have produced or procured such materials in an illegal or unethical manner, which may adversely affect our reputation and financial position. We may also be the subject of adverse publicity, for example, if home purchasers were to generate negative publicity related to the quality of the homes that we build. Such adverse publicity could be disseminated more widely through the use of the internet and social media platforms. Additionally, we could be the subject of adverse publicity from local communities who object to our developments. There can be no assurance that our efforts to liaise with local communities regarding building plans and to maintain our reputation for being a trusted partner will be successful, and a decline in our public perception may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.29,"Home building is subject to the risk of construction defects, which may give rise to contractual or other liabilities or legal disputes.","We are subject to the risk of construction defects and are currently, and may in the future become, involved in litigation, claims and disputes arising in connection with poor materials and manufactured items provided by suppliers, inadequate designs by consultants, actual or alleged defects in the work we or our subcontractors perform, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements (including safety and environmental laws and regulations), and other types of claims, including challenges relating to planning permissions and other Local Authority approvals. In the ordinary course of business, we are also exposed to National House Building Council (“NHBC”) and other warranty and indemnity claims (which may not be subject to monetary caps or other contractual limitations) during applicable defects liability periods (which can exceed ten years in some cases). We may be required to incur substantial expenditures to defend such claims and, in the case of successful claims, to rectify the defects, and may have to forego payments to which we would otherwise be entitled. ----- For a period of time following the legal completion of a sale, we are generally obliged to rectify any defects found in the home to bring it up to the standards required under the technical specifications set out in the home warranty deed. These defects are typically small and take a short time to resolve. However, in some cases, there may be a significant number of defects due to poor design, workmanship or materials which may require a longer period of time to resolve. In some cases, the presence of these defects may require the customer to move out of their new home and into temporary accommodation while work is being carried out by our employees or subcontractors. Any significant increase in such cases could increase our costs and damage our reputation, and we may face liability for defective work. Construction defects may arise sometime after the completion of a particular project or contract, and, although we seek to obtain contractual warranty, guarantee or indemnity protection in our contracts with designers, contractors, subcontractors and suppliers, we may not be able to obtain this protection in all cases. We have professional indemnity insurance which covers claims made against us and third party losses incurred due to our negligence or the negligence of our professional designers. As is typical in the new-build industry, our homes come with either a ten-year NHBC comprehensive warranty and insurance policy or a ten-year Local Authority Building Control (“LABC”) insurance policy for the benefit of the customer covering structural defects, improper environmental remediation and waterproofing. In both cases, we pay the premiums for these policies. Customers may access NHBC or LABC new home warranties if construction defects are discovered in their home. The NHBC and/or LABC, as applicable, may seek to recover from us any losses paid to such customers through the indemnity in the Homes Warranty Deed and our insurance may not cover such defects or losses or cover them fully or at all. We have a premium rating with both the NHBC and LABC. If we were to deliver homes of a substandard quality over a period of time, or if multiple customers were to make claims against our warranties or policies, our rating could be affected and premiums increased. When we are liable to pay fines or damages as a result of work or materials provided by our suppliers or subcontractors, we may seek to recoup those amounts. However, our suppliers or subcontractors may be unable to fund these amounts or may have gone out of business in the period since construction. In such cases, we could be liable for the full statutory limitation period. Significant liabilities for which we are responsible may not be identified or may only come to light after the expiry of contractual warranty, guarantee or indemnity periods. Any claims relating to defects arising on a development attributable to us may give rise to contractual or other liabilities which can extend, depending on the relevant contractual or statutory provisions, for a number of years following the completion of the project or contract. Unexpected levels of expenditure attributable to defects (including those caused by third parties) arising on a project may have a material adverse effect on the return generated by a particular project or contract and our overall performance. Furthermore, widespread or significant defects could generate significant adverse publicity and have a negative impact on our reputation and key relationships, as well as on our ability to sell housing and acquire new land, and divert financial and management resources from more beneficial uses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Although a majority of voters in the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014 voted against independence, it is possible that a new referendum in the future would lead to a different voting outcome. The pursuit of a further referendum on Scottish independence is the stated policy of the current Scottish government. The details of any changes as a result of Scottish independence are impossible to predict, and are likely to depend on post-referendum negotiations and agreements between the Scottish Government and other organizations at UK and EU level. If there were a vote in favor of independence, it could lead to a range of effects which could be negative to our business in Scotland including increased costs and taxation rates in Scotland, a decrease in investment in the housing sector in Scotland and a decrease in the demand for housing. In addition, as a result of Scottish independence, our operations in Scotland could be subject to changes in the monetary system, currency, and other regulatory and legal frameworks. For the financial year ended October 31, 2020, we derived less than 10% of our revenues from our Scotland region. In the event that any of these effects materialize, they could have an adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

For example, in 2017, we acquired MCI, a developer of social housing projects for Local Authorities and other Registered Providers. Our management may from time to time be engaged in evaluating such potential transactions, investments and other strategic alternatives. Although these activities or discussions may not result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction, we may incur significant costs or devote a significant amount of management resources to analyzing and pursuing such transactions, which could negatively impact our operations. In cases where acquisitions are completed, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate expected margins or cash flows, or to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including growth or expected synergies. There can be no assurance that our assessment of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully. The integration of acquired businesses and assets may require more investment than we expect, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies with respect to customers, employees, suppliers, Government authorities or other parties, which may impact our operating results. See also “—Ownership, leasing or occupation of land as well as _home building carries potential environmental risks and liabilities, including liability under claims for damages as a result of use of hazardous materials, including asbestos.” The process of integrating businesses may be_ disruptive to our operations and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such operations or a decrease in our results of operations as a result of difficulties or risks, including: - unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual and other issues; - difficulty in standardizing information and other systems; - difficulty in realizing operating synergies; - diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business; - failure to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided; and - potential loss of key employees and cultural challenges associated with integrating employees. Moreover, any acquisition may result in the incurrence of additional debt, which would increase our leverage and could reduce our profitability and harm our business. While we may seek protection (for example, through warranties and indemnities in the case of acquisitions), significant liabilities may not be identified in due diligence or may come to light after the expiry of warranty or indemnity periods. Additionally, while we may seek to limit our ongoing exposure (for example, through liability caps and period limits on warranties and indemnities in the case of disposals), such warranties and indemnities may be insufficient and we may incur unexpected and significant liabilities. See “—If we fail to successfully implement our business strategy or engage in future _activities where we have limited expertise, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects may be adversely affected.” Any claims arising in the future may have a material adverse effect on our_ business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. If any of our acquisitions fail to perform in accordance with our assumptions, any goodwill or other intangible assets associated with the acquisition could be subject to impairment and reduce our profitability and net assets accordingly. It is also possible that we may, from time to time, seek to divest certain businesses. For example, in 2017, pursuant to our strategy to focus exclusively on housing development, we sold our contracting arm, Keepmoat Regeneration Limited, to ENGIE, a French multinational group. In connection with any proposed divestments, we may fail to find a buyer at an acceptable price and/or may divert management’s attention from other matters. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the anticipated benefits of a proposed disposal will be realized and there may be other unanticipated or unintended effects. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means and therefore rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of such information. Our financial, accounting, data processing, IT, communications or other systems and facilities, and/or third party infrastructure on which the we rely may: (i) fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control; and (ii) be vulnerable to unauthorized access and data loss (from within the organization or by third parties), computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware attacks, cyber threats that have a security impact, and the interception or misuse of information transmitted or received by them. Where the collation of data has been centralized within a business function, it is more likely that a data protection breach would result in the loss of a large amount of data. See “—Changes in privacy laws could adversely affect the Group’s ability to interact _effectively with third parties.”_ Although we have implemented data security provisions that we believe are appropriate, particularly in respect of our centralized IT function, breaches may nonetheless occur, resulting in the loss of our customers’ confidential and other information, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or third parties. Any such breaches could lead to a loss of control over critical business information and/or systems (such as contract costs, invoicing, payroll management and/or internal reporting), resulting in an adverse impact on our ability to operate effectively or to fulfil our contractual or regulatory obligations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify these protective measures or to investigate and remedy vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation, reputational harm and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance that we maintain. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Additionally, from time to time, we may implement new or upgraded IT systems. The implementation of new IT systems could distract management from other critical business operations. Issues may be experienced during the implementation of new IT systems, which may lead to increased costs and may result in errors in operations, including the planning of projects. Our failure to properly implement new IT systems may also impact our ability to properly report our financial performance or comply with other regulatory requirements.

Our insurance policies cover contract works, professional indemnity, property, employer liability, directors and officers, pension trustee, public liability, business interruption and money, terrorism, motor vehicles, engineering and computer liability. We also obtain title defect insurance if considered appropriate following the carrying out of due diligence on a development site. As only a limited number of insurers offer coverage of this type, we may not be able to avoid increases in premiums. Furthermore, as insurance providers review the terms and conditions of our insurance policies on a periodic basis, we may not be able to obtain the same or similar coverage in the future and certain types of risks may be, or may become, either uninsurable or not economically insurable. This could increase our exposure to various risks and related costs, which in turn could have an adverse impact on our business, profitability and growth. We have not retained insurance policies for certain types of risks, including risks associated with criminal liability and radioactive contamination. Our financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected if we suffer damages or losses or if we are exposed to liability over risks for which we have no insurance coverage or insufficient insurance coverage.

The occurrence of any such events could directly affect our project sites or, more broadly, the UK economy or housing market. Any damage or destruction to our assets (including our land pipeline, development projects and major office or administrative facilities) as a result of these or other events could impact our ability to sell homes to our customers or continue our business plans. In addition, if we are unable to sell homes to our customers or continue our property development projects as a result of these or other events, we could lose our current customers, contracts or projects. Such events may increase costs, decrease demand for our homes and result in other losses that may not be insured and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. We could suffer physical damage to property or liabilities as a result of the foregoing risks, resulting in losses that may not be fully or partially covered by our insurance. In addition, certain types of risks may be, or may become in the future, either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may not be currently or in the future covered by our insurance policies. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could sustain financial loss or lose capital invested in affected property as well as anticipated future income from that property.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.35,"We are exposed to risks in connection with corporate and contractual joint ventures, other associated companies and special purpose vehicles where we do not have sole operational control.","Although joint ventures are not one of our key areas of focus, in certain cases our partners require that we set up joint ventures to facilitate delivery of specific schemes. These requirements are most common when working with Local Authorities on large-scale projects that involve multiple phases. For the financial year ended October 31, 2020, our consolidated revenue from joint venture companies amounted to £1.0 million. As of July 31, 2021, we had also provided loans totaling £9.8 million to joint ventures and associated companies in which we held less than 100% of the shares. Parent company guarantees have also been provided in some cases in respect of the obligations of joint ventures, with prior consideration given to our level of control over compliance with such obligations. In the future, we may also enter into further joint ventures or make investments or acquire participations in associated companies or special purpose vehicles. Joint ventures often require that we and our partners obtain or procure financing in furtherance of the joint venture’s operations. If one of our joint ventures or partners are unable to obtain financing when required, we may be forced to make up the financial shortfall from our own resources, which could result in additional costs or delays to the development. Conversely, if we are unable to meet our obligations under our joint venture agreements, our partners may be able to terminate our involvement in the relevant joint venture. To finance the activities of our joint ventures, our joint ventures, associated companies and special purpose vehicles may obtain loans from third party lenders, or issue bonds or other debt instruments, that are secured by the joint venture’s assets. In certain instances, we and our other partners in a joint venture may also provide guarantees and indemnities to lenders with respect to the joint venture’s debt, which may be triggered under certain conditions when the joint venture fails to fulfil its obligations under its loan agreements and debt instruments. Our ability to fully extract the strategic potential in markets where we operate through joint ventures, associated companies and special purpose vehicles may be impaired if we are unable to agree with our joint venture partners or joint shareholders on a strategy or its implementation. The interests of our joint venture partners or joint shareholders could conflict with our interests or the interests of the holders of the Notes. Minority shareholders in certain joint ventures and associated companies may also have approval or other rights under applicable corporate law or the applicable joint venture agreement, shareholder agreement or other organizational document. The interests of these minority shareholders may differ from our economic interests and may prevent ----- us from pursuing our preferred business strategy with the relevant subsidiary. Our ability to implement organizational measures and pursue our preferred financial policies (in particular, dividend policies, capital expenditure plans and allocation of company assets) may also be impeded. Where we hold non-controlling interests in companies and joint ventures, we may not be able to influence the decision making process on certain key matters or may need to obtain the consent of other shareholders or joint venture participants. We may therefore depend on the cooperation of other shareholders or participants to carry out the business and affairs of those companies or joint ventures and ensure that the company or joint venture, as well as the shareholders or participants, fulfil their respective obligations to us and to third parties. If the other shareholders or participants do not provide such cooperation or fulfil these obligations due to their financial condition, strategic business interests (which may be contrary to ours) or other reasons, we may be required to spend additional resources (including payments under the guarantees we have provided to the joint ventures’ lenders) and suffer losses, each of which could be significant. For example, under the terms of certain of our joint development agreements, we may be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of our joint venture partners in the event they become insolvent or otherwise fail to perform their obligations. Moreover, our ability to recoup such expenditures and losses by exercising remedies against our partners may be limited due to potential legal defenses they may have, their respective financial condition and other circumstances. We may have disputes with our joint venture partners and may not be able to resolve all the issues that arise with respect to such disputes, despite procedures dictated by the joint venture agreement. Such disputes may lead to delays in the development and completion of the project, or the project being developed in such a way that will not achieve its highest potential rate of return. In addition, we may accept risks or responsibilities in the course of our joint venture operations that exceed those which we would typically be prepared to accept. In addition, under certain conditions our joint venture partners or joint shareholders could (i) terminate or refuse to extend contractual relationships, (ii) exercise option rights to acquire or sell interests in our joint ventures (especially through the exercise of “deadlock” provisions to the extent contained in the underlying joint venture or shareholder agreement), or (iii) otherwise influence the day-to-day business of our joint ventures or other associated companies or special purpose vehicles. Upon dissolution or termination of a joint venture we may be required to make payments to our partners in the joint venture, and such payments could be significant. Furthermore, we could be subject to fiduciary or contractual obligations to our joint venture partners or joint shareholders, which could prevent or impede our ability to unilaterally expand in the business area in which that joint venture or associated company operates. We may also be required to carry out joint venture activities in compliance with applicable competition laws, which may limit the scope of such joint venture activity or cooperation.

In addition, the markets that we operate in could experience changes in weather patterns or weather intensity compared to historical norms, which may make the timetable for planning, developing and constructing properties more unpredictable and result in higher costs. Our exposure to events and changes of this type may be exacerbated by the fact that we operate solely in the UK.

See “Summary Historical _Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial Information” for additional details_ regarding these adjustments to our Normalized EBITDA and their underlying assumptions. We believe that Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 is a measure that assists in understanding our performance during a period impacted by the market disruption caused by COVID-19 by substituting the October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA for the October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA, comprising the months of our last calendar equivalent financial quarter prior to the market disruption caused by COVID-19. Our operations during the three months ended October 31, 2020 were negatively impacted following the government imposed lockdown and the subsequent delayed ramp up on home construction and sales, before resuming normalized operations during the three month period ended January 31, 2021. As a result, we believe Normalized EBITDA to be more representative of our Adjusted EBITDA performance for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and takes into account, on a highly illustrative basis, the cyclicality of our business. The assumptions we have made with respect to the Normalized EBITDA that we present in this Offering Memorandum are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements implied by such adjusted financial information. Specifically, to derive the Normalized EBITDA, we have replaced the last fiscal quarter of our October 31, 2020 financial year spanning a period where construction activity in the United Kingdom was still slowed due to confinement measures. In addition, Normalized EBITDA does not (i) give effect to any other event, favorable or unfavorable, that happened or could have happened during the three months ended October 31, 2020, other than the events directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic or (ii) adjust for the positive or negative effect of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic during the nine months ended July 31, 2021. As a result, we cannot assure you that the difference between the October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA and the October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA may not be partly due to factors other than the COVID-19 pandemic, such as overall market trends and conditions or competitive pressures we are facing, and there is no guarantee that any such difference is recoverable or will be recovered by our business in future periods. You should exercise caution when evaluating the adjustments reflected in the Normalized EBITDA and whether you consider these to be appropriate, as this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Normalized EBITDA is derived from management accounts and not from accounts or financial statements that are complaint with IFRS, and is materially different from Adjusted EBITDA as a result of various adjustments. Normalized EBITDA is not derived from accounts that have been audited or independently reviewed by our auditors. It should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. While we use Normalized EBITDA to assess our operating performance, and we believe that similar measures are commonly used by investors, we cannot guarantee that Normalized EBITDA, as presented in this Offering Memorandum, is comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, due to, among other things, differences in the way such measures are calculated. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

As of July 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had £285.2 million of total third-party borrowings (including lease liabilities under IFRS 16), comprising the Notes (excluding capital debt issuance costs) and development loans. See “Capitalization.” In addition, we have £70 million of further available borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility which we may draw in the future. The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to: - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow, and limiting the ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. We have historically, and may in the future, experience significant fluctuations in our monthly and intramonth working capital. As a result, we may rely on our Revolving Credit Facility to fund a portion of our working capital requirements following the Issue Date. Drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility will vary and may be substantially higher during certain months and weeks to compensate for months with reduced cash reserves. Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture, which could further exacerbate the risks described above. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that with respect to a distressed disposal of, or an enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture to be secured in priority to the Notes have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” Additionally, we could raise additional debt that could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will restrict, among other things, our ability to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - create or incur certain liens; - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the Issuer; ----- - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity; - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions; - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries; - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries; - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; - consolidate or merge with other entities; and - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. All these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the _Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future_ operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will require us to comply with a financial test under certain circumstances. Our ability to meet that financial test can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet it. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay those amounts in full, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could enforce against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as such term is defined under those agreements. Moreover, although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends, we will be able to make substantial restricted payments under certain circumstances.

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility can be further increased, assuming we have the ability to incur such additional debt under the restrictive covenants included in the Indenture. See “Description of _Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of the Notes or any other debt_ that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital-raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure,13.3.5,"Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow.","Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum rates equal to EURIBOR for loans denominated in euro, or for loans denominated in sterling, a compounded reference rate based on the Sterling Overnight Index Average compounded in arrear (“SONIA”) (as the case may be), as adjusted periodically, plus a margin. Fluctuations in EURIBOR or SONIA may increase our overall interest burden and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to service our debt obligations. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of national governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR or EURIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate LIBOR or EURIBOR. Actions by EURIBOR-EBF (the association that sets the regulatory framework for the calculation of EURIBOR), other regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR or EURIBOR is determined. In addition, SONIA, EURIBOR, LIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are or may be ----- the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which were entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, and in subsequent speeches (including the speech by its chief executive on July 12, 2018) the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR, LIBOR or SONIA is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported LIBOR or EURIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt on drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or any future indebtedness that bears interest at floating rates of interest.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Holders of the Notes will not control decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances.","The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured initially on a first-priority basis by the same Collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a _pari passu_ basis with the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to the Notes. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will permit currency and interest rate hedging and certain other indebtedness incurred in accordance with the Indenture to be secured on a priority basis. In the event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under Super Senior Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral will, after all obligations under Super Senior Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral that are permitted to rank _pari passu and are secured on a_ _pari passu basis with the Notes. As a result, proceeds from the sale of Collateral in connection with any enforcement action may be insufficient to pay claims under the Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent for the secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) for the purpose of enforcement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”_ and “Description of the Notes—Security.” Creditors under Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing such Notes and Notes Guarantees may be released.

We may increase the amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facilities or incur additional Super Senior Liabilities permitted under the Indenture, as a result of which the amount that will benefit from “super priority” first-priority security interests in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted under the Indenture. The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral. If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. The value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions. The fair market value of the Collateral at any point in time may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. As a result, the book value of the Collateral should not be conclusively relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets following the occurrence of an event of default or enforcement event under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the security granted over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the charged shares or other Collateral or, if such market does exist, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first priority ranking of security interests with respect to the Notes can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share charges, whether ----- by means of a public auction or a competitive sales process, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in respect of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding-up proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in the Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being voided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest. The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taker over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of charges is sometimes determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) may have priority. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or actions to perfect or ensure the perfection of, any security interest in the Notes against third parties.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor company becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such company; and - the creditors of such non-guarantor company, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Notes and each Notes Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

However, the Indenture will provide that each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Notes Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See “Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The_ same limitations may apply to security interests (other than the Notes Guarantees) that will be provided by the Guarantors in certain jurisdictions. Enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees or security against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, the preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Notes Guarantee or other security depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Notes Guarantee against any Guarantor. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant ----- Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Notes Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor; or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Notes Guarantees has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee and the Guarantor: (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Notes Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture or other securities pursuant to the Security Documents. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee or other security will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution, or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. It is possible that the entire Notes Guarantee or other security may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Notes Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Notes Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Notes Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Notes Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Notes Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. The payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes Guarantees and Security Documents. We are under no obligation to maintain a specific level of distributable profits and reserves, and, if we have distributable profits and reserves, we may make dividend payments or payments of principal and interest on the intercompany loan that reduce our distributable profits and reserves to zero. We may make dividends and enter into intercompany loans to service indebtedness and for tax planning purposes. There can be no assurance that we will have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not we distribute dividends or enter into intercompany loans. The payment of dividends to service our debt obligations (including under the Notes) will deplete the distributable reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes Guarantees. In addition, the payment under the Notes Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may trigger a mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. If we repay a portion of the Notes in an amount over 50% of the principal amount of the Notes in aggregate, we will be required under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to reduce the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility proportionately in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control were to occur at a time when our group is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer would remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that our Group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” ----- The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control will be deemed not to be a Change of Control if a certain net consolidated leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the “Description of the Notes” is not exceeded in connection with such an event. In this case holders of Notes would not be entitled to require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes and would only be able to rely on the then prevailing trading prices in order to exit their investments, which might be lower than the 101% change of control repurchase price. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Certain _Definitions—Change of Control Triggering Event.”_ The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade.

These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the pound sterling against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the date of consummation of the Acquisition, the cash consideration to be paid pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement on the Completion Date, the outstanding balances due under the Existing Target Indebtedness as of the Completion Date, the amount of the Equity Contribution and the difference between estimated and actual fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. In particular, the purchase price under the Acquisition Agreement as shown below reflects the agreed base consideration as adjusted for our estimates of an agreed ticker fee accruing until the Completion Date and certain notified cash leakage items, certain payments arising as a result of the Transactions and certain other adjustments required under the Acquisition Agreement. This amount is expected to change depending on number of factors, including, among others, the timing of the Completion Date.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

The Issuer was formed on September 7, 2021, for the purpose of issuing the Notes offered hereby. The Company was incorporated on July 23, 2021 for the purposes of facilitating the Transactions. The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Company has no material assets or liabilities, does not have any revenue generating activities of its own, and has not engaged in actions other than those related to its incorporation and in preparation of the Transactions. As a result, no historical information of the Company is included in this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer conducts no business operations of its own and, as of the Issue Date, will have no material assets and its only material liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness (including its obligations under the Notes) and, as of the Completion Date, its only material assets will be its rights and claims under the Proceeds Loan. The Issuer has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its formation and the issuance of the Notes. The Target has not prepared consolidated financial information and operates its business through Keystone Midco Limited and its subsidiaries. Furthermore, neither the Issuer nor the Company has any material assets or liabilities and neither has engaged in any activities other than those related to their formation in preparation for the Offering and the Transactions. Because of the limited historical financial information available for the Issuer, the Company and the Target, unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is the historical consolidated financial information of the KM Group, which is generally representative of the financial information of the Group. See “Presentation of Historical and Other Information— _Differences Between the Financial Statements of the Target and the KM Group.”_ In 2018, the KM Group changed its financial year end from March 31 to October 31. As a result, the KM Group’s financial year ended on October 31 for the financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020, and on March 31 for the financial year ended March 31, 2018. In addition, in connection with the change in financial year, the KM Group presented audited financial statements as of and for the seven months ended October 31, 2018.

Registered Provider sales comprises all sales to Registered Providers that are contracted at the outset of development of a site, including but not limited to those contracted to satisfy Section 106 obligations. Open market sales include private sales, elective sales to Registered Providers agreed during the development of a site, Affordable Homes Programme sales and private rental sector sales. See “—Description of Statement of Comprehensive Income—Revenue.” (3) Private sales customer mix based on statistics from a survey of 1,053 private sales customers in the financial year ended October 31, 2020. Sustainability is also a key driver of our operations, with a particular focus on community-building and place making. In July 2020, following stakeholder consultation, we published our Sustainability Strategy in which we identified our material issues and aligned our strategy to eight United Nations Sustainable Development Goals SDGs. Through our Sustainability Strategy, we have committed to minimizing our impact on the environment and biodiversity. In particular, we have announced that we intend to achieve a net zero carbon position by the mid-2040s (having formally committed to Race to Zero) and that we intend to publicly disclose our carbon performance from 2022 onwards. We were active on 94 sites as of July 31, 2021. In addition, as of July 31, 2021, the number of plots within our land pipeline was 24,654, with approximately 81% of our land pipeline, or 19,933 plots, being legally secured (meaning that we have a contractual right to develop or a conditionally exchanged contract). As of July 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our land pipeline, or 4,721 plots, were those on which we had been appointed ----- preferred developer (meaning that we had been chosen by the land vendor as the final candidate to progress to contract for the development of the site). Together, these plots are equivalent to a six-year supply of homes, based on our pre-pandemic annual completion levels. As of July 31, 2021, we had a forward order book of approximately £503 million (representing 3,151 plots) with an open market sales rate of 0.77 for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021. As of September 19, 2021, we had reserved, exchanged or legally completed almost all of our planned sales for the financial year ending October 31, 2021. Furthermore, as of September 19, 2021, we had secured approximately 40% of our planned sales for the year ended October 31, 2022, 85% of our planned sales for the three months ended January 31, 2022, and 45% of our planned sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022. As of September 19, 2021, we had an eight-week rolling average rate of 0.93, demonstrating continued strong demand from our customers. Our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 were £628.5 million and £73.8 million, respectively. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data.” Over the same period, we generated Free Cash Flow of £44.1 million (and free cash flow conversion of 59.8%). The resilience of our business model was demonstrated through the COVID-19 pandemic. Working with our partners, we were able to agree a deferral of 89% of committed and uncommitted land spend, without losing any site investment opportunities as a result. We believe our financial results in recent quarters demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our business model. Our focus on partnerships provides us with an attractive financial model, benefitting from typically lower land values, attractive (and often deferred) payment terms, the potential for additional elective deals with Registered Providers (beyond sales in connection with Section 106 affordable housing obligations) and access to grant funding to optimize returns.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.2,,"We are one of the UK’s oldest and most experienced partnership housebuilders, with “5-Star Homebuilder” status awarded in 2021. We are focused on creating sustainable communities in places where people want to live, and we specialize in the delivery of affordable and high quality homes, principally targeted at first-time buyers. Headquartered in Doncaster, England, we operate across England and Scotland through nine operating regions. We are a top ten UK housebuilder, measured by the number of homes sold, including delivering 4,035 homes in our financial year ended October 31, 2019. Unlike traditional housebuilders, our business model is based on partnerships with entities interested in seeing an increase in supply of homes as well as those with demand for our product. These partners are primarily land owners (such as Homes England, Local Authorities and private land owners) or Registered Providers, which include the traditional not-for-profit and the newer for-profit entities that are registered with the Regulator of Social Housing to provide affordable housing. We engage each of our key stakeholders in residential projects by establishing, aligning and prioritizing their needs and successfully delivering their objectives. We have built our reputation by aligning our approach to our partners’ objectives regarding the sourcing, procurement, planning and delivery of successful, affordable housing developments that create significant social value. We believe that we are the original partnership-focused housebuilder in the United Kingdom, having worked with over 200 partners to date, with many of these relationships enduring for over 20 years. Our partnership model allows us to have a high degree of certainty over our land pipeline, with sufficient land secured for six years of development based on our future development plans and on 2019 home deliveries, while also typically allowing us to defer payment until milestones are met. We are also able to minimize development and planning risks by partnering with land owners through the early stages of a development project. Coupled with the relatively low land costs for the affordable homes that we target, we are able to operate a capitallight business model relative to traditional housebuilders, and generate relatively strong cash conversion and ROCE. In the financial year ended October 31, 2019, the last full financial year prior to the start of the COVID19 pandemic, our ROCE was 32.8%. ----- We focus on developing urban and suburban locations where there is an inherent demand and supply imbalance for new homes. We aim to meet this demand through our five core standard house type ranges. This standardization allows efficiency in procuring materials and construction, increased certainty of cost and timing of delivery, and assists in establishing optimal site layout mix based on demand and our partners’ preferences. We are continually working with new technologies that underpin and refine our designs. We are committed to deliver a range of affordable housing, predominantly for open market sale, social housing and shared ownership – which provides us with a higher degree of market resilience over the long term due to generally consistent demand from first-time buyers and well-funded Registered Providers. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, approximately 74% of our sales were on the open market (which includes sales to private customers as well as elective sales to Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a site), with the remaining approximately 26% of our sales comprising sales to Registered Providers that are contracted at the outset of development of a site, including but not limited to those contracted to satisfy Section 106 obligations. Approximately 87% of our open market sales in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 were to private sale customers, of which approximately 76% were to first-time buyers (first-time buyers accounted for 76% during the financial year ended October 31, 2019). In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, approximately 45% of our total sales, including 67% of sales to first time buyers, involved the use of the Government HTB scheme. We believe that first-time buyers provide more resilient structural demand than the typically discretionary and cyclical home-mover segment. The following charts show our sales mix (by percentage of total homes delivered) and our private sales customer mix for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021:",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.1,Strength of the UK Housing Market and General Macro-economic Conditions in the UK,"As we operate and generate our revenue exclusively in the UK, our results are dependent on conditions in the UK housing market and general macro-economic conditions in the UK — in particular, the demand for housing and the average selling prices of houses in the regions where we operate. Demand for housing is driven by a combination of factors, such as the rate of economic growth (both nationally and regionally), the rate of population growth, the average age and life expectancy of the population, the rate of household formation, the availability and affordability of mortgages, consumer confidence, the unemployment rate and governmental tax and incentive schemes (such as the stamp duty rates, holidays and the HTB scheme). Historically, the strength of the UK housing market and of the housebuilding sector has been linked to that of the UK economy as a whole, which in turn is influenced by both European and global macro-economic conditions, all of which have been cyclical in the past. Periods of economic downturn in the UK have generally been correlated with decreases in demand for homes and in house prices, while favorable economic conditions have generally been correlated with higher demand and increases in house prices. Since 2013, the UK housing market has benefitted from an improved economic backdrop, as well as from increased Government support (including from the HTB scheme that started in 2013). This has contributed to a rise in housebuilding completions to 178,310 in the year ended December 31, 2019, the highest level since 2007. Nevertheless, the housing market is subject to its own independent dynamics and demand for housing may sometimes not correlate directly with the broader macro-economic climate. For example, although the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on UK housebuilders (including Keepmoat) during 2020 as a result of curtailed construction during the first national lockdown — with the MHCLG estimating that completions and starts of new homes in England fell 17% and 16%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020 — in general the UK housing market has seen robust demand during the pandemic, notwithstanding macro-economic uncertainty. Nationwide and Halifax reported house price increases of 7.3% and 6.0%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020 — the strongest annual growth since 2016. Mortgage lending has also been resurgent with an average of 95,806 monthly mortgage approvals for house purchases in the seven months ended February 28, 2021, the strongest level since 2007. More recent indicators suggest this momentum has continued, with the number of UK residential purchases in March 2021 being 102.3% higher than March 2020 and 32.2% higher than ----- February 2021. This momentum has been supported by the tapered extension to September 30, 2021 of the stamp duty holiday first announced in July 2020. While macroeconomic factors broadly affect the UK residential property market as a whole, property trends in the UK historically have varied significantly by region, particularly as between London and the South East on the one hand and the rest of the UK on the other hand. We operate primarily in lower cost regions (with all of our nine regions based outside of the greater London area, primarily in the Midlands and the North) where homes are generally more affordable and where prices tend not to fluctuate as much as in higher cost regions. As a result, our homes are generally priced at the more affordable end of the market (with an ASP of £174,000 in the nine months ended July 31, 2021 and £165,000 in the financial year ended October 31, 2020), providing us with a degree of resilience against macroeconomic downturns. Additionally, in many of these lower cost regions, mortgages are typically more affordable than rents, which provides additional impetus for first-time buyers to buy in lieu of renting. We sell the majority of our homes into the private market, but we are committed to a strategy of delivering homes of mixed tenure – predominantly for open market sale, affordable rent and shared ownership – helping to provide a degree of resilience in the longer term through diversification. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 74% of our sales were on the open market (which includes sales to private customers as well as elective sales to Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a site), with the remaining 26% of sales to Registered Providers for affordable housing pursuant to Section 106 obligations or otherwise agreed with Registered Providers at the outset of development, where we believe demand is less subject to changing macroeconomic conditions. Approximately 87% of our open market sales in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 were to private sale customers, of which approximately 76% were to first-time buyers (74% in the financial year ended October 31, 2019). The ASP of our homes sold through open market sales in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was £165,000. Each of our regions develops and markets its homes according to local conditions and competes with both new build housing providers who sell houses at a price point similar to us and the secondary housing market. As a result, local market valuations of both new and secondary homes can impact prices and our revenues. Our results are also affected to a certain extent by the supply of housing in the second hand-market, as increased stock in the second-hand market typically leads to lower demand for, and fewer opportunities to construct, new homes. However, in general, the supply of housing in the UK market has lagged behind demand, and the regions where we operate in particular are characterized by a supply-demand imbalance. This shortfall has created favorable trends for housing developers and has encouraged the UK and devolved Scottish governments to take various stimulus measures, which have been beneficial for us. The Government has announced their target to build 300,000 homes per year by the mid-2020s (as announced in the Autumn Budget 2017), and we expect there to be continued support for the housebuilding sector as the Government seeks to achieve this target.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.2,Our Land Pipeline and Land Creditor Profile,"Our business and financial returns are highly dependent on acquiring land suitable for new homes on acceptable commercial terms and developing such projects without significant delay. A significant portion of our cost of sales relate to the costs of purchasing land. In general, lower land prices help us to sustain a capital light business model and is one of the components of achieving favorable returns. The costs of securing land in our consolidated income statement from period to period will be influenced by the terms on which the land is secured — in particular, whether payment is made up front, in phases or on deferred payment terms. Therefore, our results of operations are significantly affected by the price of land, and the terms on which it is acquired or secured for development. As of July 31, 2021, the number of plots within our land pipeline was 24,654, with approximately 81% of our land pipeline, or 19,933 plots, being legally secured (meaning that we have a contractual right to develop or a conditionally exchanged contract). As of July 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our land pipeline, or 4,721 plots, were those on which we had been appointed preferred developer (meaning that we had been chosen by the land vendor as the final candidate to progress to contract for the development of the site). Together, these plots are equivalent to a six-year supply of homes, based on our pre-pandemic annual completion levels. Our land pipeline provides us with a significant degree of visibility with respect to expected home completions and, as a result, our revenues in the near to medium term. Our partnership-focused business model differentiates us from most traditional UK housebuilders in the type of land we focus on and the way we source and deliver the land. We source land through both public and ----- private sector partners. We believe that by understanding the bid brief and being agile and resourceful in delivering on land vendors’ requirements, we make ourselves an attractive partner. Land sourced through our partnership model constituted 79% of our total land pipeline as of July 31, 2021, with the remainder being sourced through speculative land deals (where we believe we can achieve attractive financial returns). Our largest source of land is the public sector, typically Homes England and Local Authorities, with whom we achieve a high proportion of repeat business. These projects are usually brought to market through a competitive tender process, determined by the FTS (previously OJEU) process, which governs how the public sector disposes of its land assets and procures development services. In the case of Homes England, this is effected through DPP3, of which we are a member. As of July 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our secured land pipeline was secured through the Homes England DPP process. Historically, being a member of DPP3 has reduced the number of competitors that we compete against to secure large scale public land opportunities, providing us access to development sites typically unavailable to housebuilders who are not members of DPP3. Homes England launched its successor to the DPP, the DPDPS, on September 1, 2021, which is designed to modernize the bidding process through the use of a digital system and encourage new entrants to the market, simplifying the process for housebuilders to join the list of preferred developers and bid for land. We have submitted our application and received confirmation that we have been appointed member of the DPDPS. The DPDPS is not expected to be used to procure schemes until late 2021. With this new system, housebuilders will still have to qualify to be able to join the list of preferred developers, but they will be able to apply to join at any time, rather than only upon renewal of the delivery partner panel once every four years, as is currently the case. However, we believe that the depth of our experience working with Homes England and other public sector partners on large scale development projects provide us with a distinct competitive advantage. We also source land from the private sector, through relationships with a small number of national land owners and regionally with land owners and land agents. Public bodies often focus on disposing of brownfield land, which typically has a lower land value and can therefore provide a greater potential upside upon development (depending on regeneration costs). This contributes to our relatively low average land cost (approximately £20,000 per plot (equating to approximately 12.1% of our average ASP of £165,000) in the financial year ended October 31, 2020). Brownfield sites represented 73% of our legal completions in the financial year ended October 31, 2020. Our participation in a partnership development may be structured in a number of ways, which are intended to provide a blend of risk and return appropriate to the land being acquired. Arrangements may involve that we acquire the land being developed (sometimes in phases) or otherwise we may be granted with development rights while the original land owner retains ownership of the site and ultimately transfers completed units directly to the home purchaser. In the case of phased drawdowns, the price is generally finalized at the time the Group is ready to draw the particular phase of the site down for development. In such arrangements, we have sufficient time to complete all of our technical due-diligence to be able to appraise the phase based on the prevailing conditions, utilizing all the experience gained from developing the previous phase. Phased drawdowns provide us with increased visibility of the end-market and associated cost implications, which thereby reduces our market risk associated with pre-bought land. Additionally, where possible, we use deferred payment terms. As of July 31, 2021, approximately 86% of our current land pipeline included some form of deferred land payment terms. In these arrangements, rather than paying for the land up front, payments are typically structured with deferred payments to be made either on fixed dates, on a “pay per plot” sold basis or in instalments tied to milestones such as the sale of a defined cumulative number of plots or similar development milestones. In addition, some of our arrangements with development partners include overage mechanisms, whereby we make additional payments to the development partner following completion of the land sale contingent upon exceeding agreed financial thresholds, with such payments often deferred to the end of the development of a site or a significant phase of the development. Together, these deferred payment obligations and overage obligations comprise our land creditor commitments. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Commitments and Contingent Liabilities—Land Creditor _Commitments” below for further details of our land creditor commitments as of July 31, 2021._ We believe that our land creditor profile provides us with an element of risk mitigation, as the majority of our payments are linked to development delivery milestones rather than needing to be made up front. Our land creditor commitments are unwound as the relevant payments for these deferred land costs fall due and are made from period to period. Our results of operations during each period will therefore be affected by a variety of factors related to land procurement, including the number of developments, the number of completions and the structure of the ----- partnership arrangement (in particular, whether we are acquiring the land, whether the drawdown is in phases and whether there are deferred payment terms).",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.3,The Planning Approval Process,"The development of land is partly driven by the timing of the planning approval process, including the receipt of those consents which are required to deliver proposed schemes. The overall timeframe for completing the planning approval process affects how quickly we are able to realize revenue from our developments, and any complications that arise during the planning process can increase our costs, including those related to third party planning experts. The planning approval process typically takes from six to twelve months, depending on the complexity of the application and may take a longer or shorter amount of time. We are required to comply with national, local and other laws and regulations and administrative requirements and policies relating to, among other things, planning, developing, building and land use. In addition, we are required to obtain numerous permits and approvals from local authorities and other regulatory bodies regarding, among other things, remediation, roads, drainage, utilities, including gas, electricity and water, and waste removal as well as UK Town & Country Planning Act obligations. These requirements are more complex when we are developing brownfield sites. Of the 24,654 plots in our land pipeline as of July 31, 2021, approximately 19,400, or 79%, benefit from a planning permission, of which 66% have a detailed planning consent and 13% have an outline planning consent. The remaining 21% currently do not benefit from a planning consent. Of our estimated completions for the financial year ending October 31, 2021, 100% have planning permission in place.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

In particular, we benefit from strong, long-standing relationships with both public bodies (including Homes England, Local Authorities and charitable organizations, and Registered Providers) and private land owners, and 79% of the plots in our land pipeline as of July 31, 2021 were being developed under the partnership model. These relationships are built through a successful track-record of delivering projects, a reputation for aligning our approach with our partners’ objectives and a deep understanding of the motivations beyond financial returns that are key to these partners, including social value, sustainability, accelerated delivery and design quality. Working with public sector partners also provides us with the potential to access grant funding and investment support (particularly from Homes England and Local Authority partners) to facilitate the development of land that would otherwise be unviable to develop. Partnership projects are typically awarded by public bodies through competitive public procurement processes, often based on the Local Authority’s or housing association’s perception of a developer’s expertise, track record and experience with regeneration projects, design quality, reputation, price and value. Our largest delivery partner is Homes England, we have been a member of all successive DPPs to date (DPP 1, 2 and 3) and we are one of the most active developers on DPP3. As of July 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our land pipeline was secured through the Homes England DPP process. In each of these public procurement processes, we tailor our bids in accordance with the bidding criteria released by the authority, and we believe that we enjoy a significant advantage against many competing bidders by virtue of our deep understanding of the public procurement process, combined with our experience and track record of delivering notable regeneration and development projects aligning with the social goals of public sector partners. Our partnership model and our focus on working with partners in the affordable end of the housing market allow us to achieve capital light land sourcing and site development, with typically lower land prices and favorable (often deferred) payment terms, as well as the ability to access grant funding. We also experience a number of benefits from our work with Registered Providers, including (i) the use of multi-tenure housing (such as share ownership homes), which provide a natural complement to our open market sales; (ii) resilience through the economic cycle as Registered Providers are well funded by the UK Government; (iii) a capital efficient workstream, with Registered Providers often paying incrementally, but in advance for homes as they are built, often with a significant upfront deposit which thereby strengthens our project ROCE; (iv) the potential for additional elective sales during the development of a site on attractive financial terms which provide additional revenue visibility; and (v) strong appetite for homes from Registered Providers who then in ----- turn generate strong commercial offers typically close to full open market value (outside of the sales pursuant to Section 106 obligations, which are often at a significant discount to open market value). As a result of our use of the partnership model, our relationships with Homes England, other public and private land owners and Registered Providers have a significant impact on the development opportunities available to us and, therefore, the number of homes that we sell and our revenues from period to period. As a result, our reputation and relationships with Homes England and key Local Authorities are critical to our success.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.5,The Availability and Affordability of UK Residential Mortgages,"Home purchases in the UK are often facilitated through mortgage lending, and 89% and 91% of our homes that were sold through private sales were purchased by customers with the assistance of mortgages in the financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. A large proportion of buyers of our homes are first-time buyers, who are especially dependent upon the availability of mortgages. As a result, the UK mortgage market and the availability of financing options directly impact our customers’ ability to secure long-term financing to purchase our homes. Our revenue is therefore directly influenced by the willingness of banks to lend to customers at affordable rates and any change in available mortgage products can have a significant impact on our revenue. Reduced availability of affordable mortgage financing and factors that increase the upfront or monthly cost of financing the purchase of a home, including increases in interest rates, insurance premiums or taxes or other charges associated with the purchase or ownership of a home, all impact the affordability of, and therefore the level of demand for, the homes that we build. The general UK economy significantly influences interest rates and, subsequently, mortgage rates. The continuing availability of a wide range of mortgage financing options and low interest rates has in recent years ensured that funding remains affordable in the markets where we are focused. During the period under review, the Bank of England base rate has ranged from 0.75% to 0.1%. However, increases in the base rate have previously had a negative impact on the UK property market because interest rates charged on mortgages increased correspondingly, thereby making home purchases less affordable for prospective buyers. Prospective buyers who can obtain a mortgage at current interest rates may be deterred by the possibility of increased rates (and, in turn, higher monthly interest payments) in the future and instead elect to remain in their current property or to continue renting. Higher mortgage interest rates would likely have an adverse impact on our transaction volumes and the revenue derived from them. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK Finance estimated that UK gross mortgage lending would fall by an estimated 13% in 2020, to £233 billion, and that it would fall to £215 billion in 2021 before recovering to £230 billion by 2022. However, recent mortgage approval data suggests that mortgage lending in 2021 could be stronger than those estimates indicate, as approvals in the seven months ended July 31, 2021 averaged 84,735 (78% ahead of the comparative period a year prior, which was undisturbed by the COVID19 pandemic). In terms of affordability, Nationwide estimate that first-time buyers in the UK spent an average of 31.7% of mean take-home pay on mortgage payments in the fourth quarter of 2020. This compares to the average since 1983 of 33.1%, a low of 17.5% in 1996 and a high of 55.8% in the fourth quarter of 1989. This demonstrates that while first-time buyer house price-to-earnings multiples are close to an all-time high (5.2x at the end of 2020) mortgage rates are low in a historic context, reflecting low base rates. The price-to-earnings multiple is also highly dependent upon region, with average multiples of 5.2x for the North East and 5.7x for the North West, compared to 12.4x for London and the surrounding areas. Lower price-to-earnings multiples indicate greater affordability, and our business is focused principally upon the more affordable regions which are characterized by lower priceto-earnings ratios. We believe that our business is less sensitive to these spreads given our relatively low ASP and, currently, the support of the HTB scheme for first-time buyers, with rates on offer under the scheme trending at approximately 1.7% for three- and five-year fixed rate periods in 2021. However, the HTB scheme is currently scheduled to expire in 2023 and it remains unclear whether the scheme will be extended (and, if it is extended, whether it will be modified) and what impact an expiry or modification would have on the affordability of mortgages for the first-time buyer market. The housebuilding sector and lenders are currently exploring new low-deposit mortgage products to provide additional alternatives for buyers, including a product backed by a mortgage indemnity scheme developed by the Home Builders Federation and other market participants that will offer 95% LTV mortgages for new homes. Upon completion of home purchases offered as part of the scheme, the developer pays a percentage of the purchase price into an insurance policy, which reduces risk for the lender. This scheme is currently being piloted in the ----- North East of the UK but is expected to be rolled out more widely across the UK in 2021 should the trial prove to be successful. Any changes in the availability of mortgage financing, interest rates or lending guidelines or other factors that increase the upfront or monthly cost of financing a home could impact both the demand for our homes and their pricing, which will, in turn, affect our revenue and profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.6,Government Purchase Assistance Schemes,"As a UK housebuilder with a particular focus on the affordable end of the UK housing market and firsttime buyers, our results of operations are significantly affected by the level and nature of Government purchase assistance schemes. Since 2016, the UK Government has focused its approach on providing additional new homes through a number of policy statements and initiatives including an increase in its capital funding for its Affordable Homes Programme, a £1 billion loan scheme to support SME housebuilders, confirmation of HTB funding and additional capital for various funds, including the “Housing Infrastructure Fund,” the “Land Release Fund” and the “Planning Delivery Fund.” In addition, the UK government is currently targeting to build 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s, a goal that has significant cross-party support. In June 2021, the UK Government launched a new initiative called “First Homes” will extend the tenures being offered through local authorities planning policy for affordable housing. The First Homes initiative offers first-time buyers the opportunity to buy a home at a discount (minimum 30%) in perpetuity subject to meeting local and key work eligibility criteria. These stimulus measures make it easier for us to sell homes and hence have an impact on our revenue and margins. These government programs are particularly important when traditional mortgage lenders do not have suitable products available for, or are unwilling to provide based on their lending criteria, the full loan amount required by home buyers. A significant number of our customers have used HTB, a UK government equity loan scheme designed to encourage home ownership in the UK. The HTB program provides assistance to purchasers of new-build homes in the UK by reducing the minimum down payment required from the purchaser to 5% of a property’s value and providing an equity loan of up to 20%, or 40% in London, of the property value (originally available up to a value of £600,000). HTB sales represented approximately 68% of our private sales in the financial year ended October 31, 2020. The HTB scheme has been modified and extended to March 2023, but with reforms restricting the scheme to support only first-time buyers from April 1, 2021 onwards and with regional price caps ranging from £186,100 in the North East to £600,000 in London. As a result of these reforms, non-first-time buyers who previously would have been able to secure funding through the HTB scheme are no longer eligible to do so, which in turn could have an adverse impact on our home sales. In addition, the HTB scheme remains subject to future regulatory changes, including to applicable eligibility criteria, and such changes may affect the availability of government funding of mortgages, which in turn may affect public demand in the homes market. It is not currently known whether the HTB scheme will be extended after 2023 or, if it is extended, how it may be modified, or whether any other similar UK Government-backed program will continue at current levels, or at all, or that lenders will participate in them. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business— A majority of our business is secured _or supported either directly or indirectly from various Government sources, and changes in local or Government funds, loans, grants or subsidies, or changes to or the discontinuation of mortgage assistance schemes or equity loan schemes (including in particular Help to Buy) could significantly impact our business.”_ Scotland has a separate program (Help to Buy (Scotland)), and its “Affordable New Build Scheme” available to larger housebuilders (including Keepmoat) stopped accepting new applications on February 5, 2021. However, we believe that this has not had a material effect on demand for our homes in Scotland. The availability of funding for these programs remains subject to governmental decisions. In the future, governments and/or local bodies may change their priorities and programs, for example, by reducing or amending mortgage assistance schemes, or undertaking welfare reforms that may impact funding stability for housing associations and local authorities. Any reduction or discontinuation of UK Government-backed home purchase assistance programs in the future may make it more difficult for our core first-time buyer customers to afford homes, which would make it more difficult for us to sell homes and may force us to either lower prices or increase purchase incentives. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.7,Product Mix and ASPs,"Our profitability is influenced by the number of legal completions we achieve and the margin we earn on those completions. The margins we earn can vary significantly and depend on the underlying profitability of the projects, the types of homes sold and the location of the sites. Therefore, our results can be significantly affected by product mix and regional mix. In terms of product mix, our results are affected in particular by the split between open market sales and sales to Registered Providers. We pursue a strategy that blends the potential of margin enhancement through higher-margin open-market sales with the certainty, risk mitigation and cash generation of selling to Registered Providers for affordable rent and shared ownership housing. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, we sold 74% of our plots on the open market (which includes sales to private customers as well as elective sales to Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a site), with 26% to Registered Providers as part of Section 106 affordable housing obligations in connection with planning consents or otherwise agreed with Registered Providers at the outset of development. In comparison, in the financial year ended October 31, 2019, we sold 78% of our plots in the open market and 22% to Registered Providers. Although the sales prices of homes sold to Registered Providers pursuant to Section 106 affordable housing obligations are typically lower than open market sales, and involve lower margins, the sales often involve the Registered Providers forward funding these, both providing revenue visibility and reducing the working capital needs of sites. In addition, this enables us to use the cash proceeds from such sales to accelerate delivery of site outputs, ultimately generating an enhanced ROCE. In addition to the sales in connection with Section 106 obligations, we are able to agree additional sales to Registered Providers either at the outset of a development (in which case we categorize these as Registered Provider sales, alongside the sales pursuant to Section 106 obligations) or as elective sales during the development of a site (in which case we categorize these as open market sales). In either case, for sales outside of Section 106 obligations the Registered Providers are able to utilize Affordable Homes Programme funding, which helps to generate attractive commercial offers. In particular, elective sales agreed during the development of a site are benchmarked against other open market sale opportunities and are often at only a small discount to the open market price. Our results are also affected by the regional mix of sales among our nine regions, with some of our regions having higher ASPs than other regions. For example, in the nine months ended July 31, 2021, our regional ASPs ranged from £138,000 in our North West MCI region to £221,000 in our South Midlands region. Our results may therefore vary from period to period as we expand our operations in certain regions and based on the location of the development opportunities available to us in each period. While our product mix and regional mix is largely within our control, we are impacted by external factors, in particular the availability of planning consents and government policy. In the near term, our margins are also affected by site mix, reflecting the fact that current management has implemented an enhanced land sourcing process that we believe has resulted in a progressively increasing mix of higher quality, better procured sites. For example, for sites under development that were approved between 2017 and 2019 (excluding the North West MCI region), average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for each year of approval range from approximately 22% to 23% by year, whereas for sites either approved since 2020 or within our secured pipeline and to be approved, average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for each year of approval or for the “to be approved” category, range from approximately 24% to 25% by year or category.

Factors outside our control, including raw materials prices and wage costs, can have a material impact on these costs and, accordingly, our financial results. We sub-contract a large proportion of the actual construction of our developments to third-party providers and therefore our ability to source sub-contractors that meet our strict quality requirements and rate/price expectations are important to our business. We compete for labor with our competitors in the housebuilding sector and with housebuilders in other sectors and, therefore, changes in the labor market directly impact our costs. The concentration of our sub-contractors is low. This diversification reduces our exposure to individual subcontractor ----- risk. In addition, in order to reduce risks of subcontractor rate increases on developments, we typically aim to lock in subcontractor prices over a phase, or part-phase, of a development through “all risk” contracts. We are directly exposed to the cyclicality of the construction industry, which impacts the labor market. During periods of market contraction, pools of labor leave the market, sometimes permanently, for example to retrain in other professions or move abroad in search of work. During periods of increased construction activity, competition among housebuilders for qualified labor increases and the associated impact on labor rates and availability can impact us, and result in materially higher labor costs. This has been demonstrated during the current financial year, with high levels of construction activity in the UK housebuilding sector giving rise to increasing competition for skilled labor and a consequential increase in labor costs. We are also affected by our ability to source sufficient materials at competitive prices. The cyclicality of the construction industry also impacts the supply of materials so that in times of market contraction, production is scaled back and therefore when markets recover there can be a lag on supply which pushes prices upwards. More generally, periods of increased construction activity can give rise to demand and supply imbalances which tend to increase construction costs. For example, a significant increase in UK housebuilding activity during the current financial year has resulted in a significant increase in demand for construction materials and a lengthening of supplier delivery times. Data released by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy indicated that the overall cost of materials for new housing was 6.7% higher in January 2021 than in January 2020. An IHS Markit/Cips UK survey published in May 2021 indicated that input-cost inflation had increased for the seventh month in a row to its highest level since the survey began in April 1997, with steel and timber experiencing particularly sharp price rises. We seek to mitigate any supply shortages and cost inflation risk by having strong supplier relationships that can meet our demands. Our material supply-chain strategy is underpinned by annual, Group-wide deals with suppliers with national coverage. This enables us to negotiate better commercial terms through consolidated volume and enables the utilization of volume-related rebates. We operate a series of group-wide, long-term strategic frameworks providing preferential commercial terms and service levels nationally and regionally for supply of materials, site equipment and business consumables. Our supply chain team manage over 96 arrangements which are made up of framework agreements, commercial arrangements and formal price lists. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 88% of our direct spend was channeled through these frameworks. Our use of standardized designs helps to reduce and improve the predictability of costs, improves construction build times and quality and continues to provide us with the flexibility to utilize our skills and experience in design and place-making by tailoring aspects of our standardized designs to each particular development. Although the amount of homes built using our standardized type varies from year to year, in the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 88% of our homes were build using a standardized house type. We believe that our shift to increased construction standardization can help reduce costs and build times while continuing to allow us to utilize our skills and experience in design and place-making. We also seek to mitigate the risk of price rises through the use of phased viability in developments where possible, allowing increased build costs to be included in future phases following updated viability assessments, facilitating the delivery of our required financial returns if the cost base increases on subsequent phases. This mechanism mitigates the impact of cost increases on future phases, but does not affect cost increases during the construction of a particular phase. Our supply chain and costs could also be affected by political events, such as the ongoing effects of Brexit. We have worked closely with our supply chain since the Brexit vote to ensure that we understand the changes arising from Brexit. We have continued with this close engagement since the confirmation of the new trade arrangements to understand their challenges and contingency strategies. These include careful monitoring, increasing UK stock holding and diverting imports to alternative UK ports where bottlenecks are predicted. At this stage, we have not experienced any significant supply chain issues associated with Brexit. Central overhead costs (including central administrative personnel as well as non-personnel overhead costs for central office rental and rates as well as IT costs, insurance, audit, legal, tax and other consultancy services and other expenses) represented 3% and 4% of our revenue in the years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, while regional overhead costs (including regional administrative personnel as well as nonpersonnel overhead costs for regional office rental and rates and other expenses) represented 6% and 8% of our revenue. ----- Our overhead has risen in recent years as a result of our expansion into new regions. However, as our operations in these regions mature, we expect to capture greater operational efficiencies and reduce overhead costs as a percentage of revenue, enhancing our profit margins. We expect this decrease in overhead costs as a percentage of revenue will be driven principally by efficiencies of scale in growth regions and central overheads. We have also made significant investments in personnel at both the regional and head office level to support our growth and build a national platform for future expansion in our target geographies. Margins have remained stable over this period and we have proven our ability to invest and grow scale.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.9,Seasonality,"Historically, our revenues and levels of working capital have varied during the year due to peaks of completions in certain months of the year. As a consequence, our debt profile has exhibited peaks and troughs over the course of the financial year consistent with seasonal trends. The timing of completions within a financial year is influenced by a number of factors. Typically, the majority of our reservations for open market sales are made in January to March and August to October (with the latter correlated to the start of the new school year). Our ability to manage the timeline from the engagement and planning phase to the exchange of contract and legal completion is, therefore, one of the factors that affects the timing of completions. Although we generally have a significant degree of flexibility in managing the phasing of completions and typically aim to stagger the timing of our completions to the extent practicable, the impact of weather on building activity and plot delivery has also tended to favor a peak in completions in the late summer and early autumn. In addition, prior to the change of the KM Group’s financial year end from March 31 to October 31 in 2018, divisional efforts to achieve targets and maximize sales for the financial year end led to a peak of completions in March. This had an effect on our results of operations for the financial year ended October 31, 2019, as our incentive scheme for that financial year remained tied to an end date of March 31. However, we do not expect this to have an impact on our financial results in any subsequent years. For the financial year ended October 31, 2021 we have amended our incentive targets to include an additional measure tied to half-year targets, in order to achieve a more levelled number of completions throughout the financial year. The above factors may lead to volatility in our quarterly financial results. These factors that affect the phasing of completions through a financial year tend to result in a weighting of plot completions, and accordingly revenue and profit, to the last quarter of financial years. Results of a single fiscal quarter or half year might therefore not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a full financial year and may not be comparable with the results in the other fiscal quarters or half year. Factors that affect our peak selling seasons can have a disproportionate impact on our performance in a particular period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Factors Affecting Comparability,17.4.2,Changes to Accounting Principles,"_IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers)_ IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) was issued in 2014 and was endorsed by the EU in 2016. IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 (Revenue). IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We adopted IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) from April 1, 2018 in accordance with the fully retrospective transitional approach without using the practical expedients for completed contracts or for modified contracts. We have applied the expedient allowing both non-disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, and an explanation of when it expects to recognize that amount as revenue for all reporting periods presented before the date of initial application. Under IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), revenue is recognized based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This can lead to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. The majority of our revenue and profit, including revenue from open market sales, continues to be recognized on legal completion. For those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from Registered Providers, revenue is recognized based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) also sets out the requirements for recognition of noncash consideration as revenue. Previously, where we entered into arrangements to provide housing to Registered Providers at below open market value in exchange for discounted land from partners, the associated housing unit revenue was recorded at open market value. IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) does not permit this, as the exchange transaction (land discount from partner) is not received directly from the customer (the Registered Provider) and so does not meet the criteria of non-cash consideration. This change has the impact of reducing reported revenue. Accordingly, the revenue recognized in respect of these housing units will be equal to the cash consideration received from Registered Providers, with no open market value adjustment. There are a limited number of developments where the eventual buyer of the affordable units is the same entity as the land vendor. In these instances, the discount received represents non-cash consideration, which continues to be recognized as revenue. _IFRS 16 (Leases)_ On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 (Leases) replaced IAS 17 (Leases) and the related International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee’s and the Standards Interpretation Committee’s interpretations, and results in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. IFRS 16 (Leases) is effective for fiscal years commencing on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted if IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) has also been applied. We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) from November 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, comparative information is not restated and the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 (Leases) is recognized in retained earnings at the date of initial application. In particular, as a consequence of IFRS 16 (Leases) our total assets and liabilities increased as the right of use asset associated with leases and the corresponding liability, which were previously treated as operating leases, are recognized on the balance sheet. In addition, operating lease expenditure has been reclassified and split between depreciation and finance cost, and as a result, our EBITDA increased. IFRS 16 (Leases) was effective for the financial year ended October 31, 2020. The impact of adopting IFRS 16 (Leases) for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was the recognition of right of use assets of £8.0 million and lease liabilities of £8.6 million on transition in respect of offices, company vehicles, site plant equipment and show homes. The impact on Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was ----- £0.6 million. This information may not be indicative of the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases) on our total assets, total liabilities and EBITDA for the next financial year or any future period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

As a result of program disruption and the costs of operating with COVID-19 working practices and social-distancing measures, our delivery volumes declined significantly given construction activity was significantly stalled from April through August 2020, our margins declined slightly compared to the financial year ended October 31, 2019 and our EBIT and ROCE performance eroded significantly. However, as demonstrated by our performance for the nine months ended July 31, 2021 and our forward order book, we have recovered strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe that we are well positioned to deliver on our planned growth in the medium term. We have benefitted from a robust UK housing market, with a favorable mortgage environment, ongoing government support and strong demand, against the resilient economic backdrop during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the strict lockdown measures that were imposed through April 2021, for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, our Adjusted EBIT and ROCE increased 12.8% and 150 basis points, respectively, as compared to the financial year ended October 31, 2019. We believe our financial results in recent quarters demonstrates the resiliency and strength of our business model. The COVID-19 lockdown restrictions imposed in March 2020 caused our financial performance to decline but did not stress our overall financial profile given the lower risk inherent in our partnership model. In addition, during the financial year ended October 31, 2020, £24.4 million in partner payments were deferred, representing approximately 80% of our total commitments, which illustrates the flexible land creditor profile we maintain.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

This can lead to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. The majority of our revenue and profit, including revenue from open market sales, is recognized at legal completion. For those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from Registered Providers (which are government approved organizations that provides Affordable Housing, including Housing Associations, Local Authorities and private companies) for the provision of housing or where we undertake development contracts, revenue is recognized based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. We consider the provision of land and residential properties to represent a single performance obligation which represents a judgement taken in the application of IFRS 15. _Sale of Housing to Open Market Customers_ Revenue and profits associated with these activities are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income on legal completion. Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognized at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable upon legal completion. Open market sale plots are recognized at the agreed sales price which is deemed to be fair value. _Sale of Housing to Registered Provider Customers and Associated Development Contracts (with Stage Payments)_ We construct and sell residential properties and undertake associated development activities under longterm contracts with customers. Such contracts are entered into before construction of residential properties or associated development activities begin. Under the terms of the contracts, we are restricted from redirecting the properties or development works to another customer and have an enforceable right to payment for work done. Revenue from construction of residential properties and associated development activities is therefore recognized over time based on a certified monthly valuation of work performed or the assessed physical stage of completion at the balance sheet date. We consider that this method is an appropriate measure of the progress towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations under IFRS 15. ----- _Sale of Housing to Registered Provider Customers (without Stage Payments)_ Revenue and profits associated with these activities are included in the statement of comprehensive income on legal completion, at which point control is passed from us to the purchaser.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Our objective is to manage liquidity by ensuring that we will always have sufficient liquidity to meet our ----- liabilities as they become due. This is assessed under normal and stress conditions, without incurring losses or risking damage to our reputation. In connection with the Transactions, we will establish the Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of £70 million. We believe we have a rigorous cash management processes. Cash balances are reported daily with detailed analysis of variances to short term cash forecasts. Short term cash forecasts are updated monthly and for a period of 26 weeks, with the first eight weeks on a daily basis and the remaining 18 weeks on a weekly basis. These complement our minimum of four long term quarterly cash forecasts each year which are compared to the annual cash flow budget and to previous quarterly forecasts. These facilitate management’s assessments of our expected cash performance and to compare to the facilities available and our covenants. Key risks to liquidity and cash balances are a decrease in the value of open market sales, a downturn in the UK housing market, deterioration in credit terms obtainable in the market from suppliers and subcontractors, a downturn in the profitability of work, delayed receipt of cash from customers and a general decline in the ability of local authorities to fund urban regeneration projects. In order to mitigate this risk we continually monitor open market house sales volumes and prices; continuous monitoring of working capital levels and contract profitability and the review of client and supplier credit references and credit terms with clients and suppliers to ensure they continue to be appropriate.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.28,Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,17.28.4,Credit Risk,"Credit risk relates to our risk of financial loss if a customer fails to meet their contractual obligations. The risk mainly arises on our trade receivables and amounts due from construction contract customers. IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model, rather than an incurred credit loss model to be applied. This requires the assessment of the expected credit loss on each class of financial asset at each reporting date. This assessment takes into consideration changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset. Our exposure to credit risk is limited for open market housebuilding activities as we typically receive cash at the point of legal completion of our sales. The credit risk on Registered Provider sales depends on the individual characteristics of the counterparty, many of whom are in the public sector or are funded by the public sector (e.g., housing associations). We believe the credit rating of these customers to be good and the credit risk on outstanding balances to be low. A highly immaterial provision is present in all periods. We do not have any concentration of risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract receivables or trade receivable balances, with receivables spread across a wide range of customers. We apply the simplified approach under IFRS 9 to measure expected credit losses associated with trade and other receivables. The carrying value of receivables is reduced at each reporting date for any increase in the lifetime expected credit losses with an impairment loss recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.30,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW History and Overview of United Kingdom Housing Market,17.30.1,,"Housing output in the United Kingdom has ranged between approximately 130,000 and 250,000 completions per annum since 1980, a level much lower than in the 1960s and 1970s when direct local authority build programs pushed housing completions toward 400,000 per annum. Against this backdrop, private sector housing completions have trended between 150,000 and 210,000 per annum since the 1960s – except for the periods immediately following the 1970s’ recession and the global financial crisis that started in 2008 (the “GFC”) when completions fell below this level. This is in contrast to many European countries where housebuilding rates per person have exceeded that of the UK. In 2004, the Government commissioned the Barker Report to conduct a review of the underlying supply issues and responsiveness of housing in the UK, with due consideration given to the role of competition, capacity, technology, and finances of the housebuilding industry. In addition, the report sought to explore the interplay between these factors and the wider UK planning system in order to distinguish where shortfalls were presenting themselves. More specifically, the review stated its key objectives as achieving: (1) improvements in housing affordability in the market sector; (2) a more stable housing market; (3) a location of housing supply which supports patterns of economic data; and (4) an adequate supply of publicly-funded housing for those who need it. As the report highlighted, the aforementioned level of housebuilding fell short of the growth in household formations and resulted in the recommendation that the UK should be building 240,000 houses per annum to reduce the growth in house prices to zero real growth. The report also highlighted the greatest shortfall of housing provision was within the affordable housing marketplace and recommended that greater Government subsidy in this area was required. While UK housebuilding rates improved post the Barker Report to 223,590 homes in 2007, the impact of the GFC resulted in housing completions falling to a record low of 135,980 in 2010. This was compounded by the stress in the banking sector and led to mortgage approvals for house purchases falling to approximately 26,000 in November 2008, compared to pre-GFC mortgage volumes which did not fall below 100,000 per month. These trends in housing completions have been against the backdrop of a growing housing shortage, as demonstrated by the following graph displaying the cumulative housing shortage in England between 2007 and 2020: This backdrop has led to the Government taking a more active role in the UK housing market, to promote home ownership and higher levels of housing completions. Arguably the most effective program has been the Help to Buy equity loan scheme, which was announced in April 2013 and provides buyers who contribute deposits of at least 5% with an interest free equity loan of up to 20% (London 40%) to help support the purchase of a new build home. The scheme was originally intended to run until 2017, but it has been extended several times and is now scheduled to run until March 2023 (with certain variations, including that it is available only to first-time buyers from April 1, 2021). The improved macroeconomic backdrop from 2013, alongside Government support, enabled housebuilding completions to rise to 214,190 in the year to December 31, 2019, the highest level since 2007. ----- 172,010 of these were built by the private sector, 38,390 by housing associations and only 3,800 by local authorities (compared to 415,460 total completions in 1967, 204,210 of which were built by the private sector). This level of build still fell well short of the Government’s target to build 300,000 homes per year by the mid2020s (as announced in the Autumn Budget 2017). The following chart shows the level of public sector and private sector new housing completions from 1969 to 2020, as compared against the Government’s current target of 300,000 homes per year: In keeping with other industries, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented major challenges for the UK housing market and the construction of new homes. While data for the UK is not yet available, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (“MHCLG”) estimates that completions and starts of new homes in England fell 17% and 16% in the year to December 31, 2020, respectively. This reflected the substantial closure of the UK housing market between March and May 2020 (alongside the national lockdown) and the practical effects social distancing had upon the rate of build. Since restrictions were eased following the first national lockdown in May 2020, housing market activity has been strong. Total housing completions in 2020 for England totaled 148,630, a decrease of 17% compared to the year ending December 31, 2019, despite the widespread disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic early in the year. Nationwide and Halifax reported house price increases of 7.3% and 6.0%, respectively, in the year ending December 31, 2020 – the strongest annual growth since 2016, demonstrating a continued momentum in UK house prices. The following chart shows the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the nationwide house price growth, as well as on the amount of newly agreed sales and completed transactions for the periods indicated: The following graph shows UK nominal and real house price growth from 2000 to the first quarter of 2021, according to Nationwide. Nominal house prices include all UK properties, without taking into account ----- seasonal adjustments. Real house price are adjusted for retail prices, using the Office for National Statistics Retail Price Index (“RPI”) to convert nominal prices to current prices. Source: Savills Residential Property Forecast, March 2021 Mortgage lending has also been resurgent with an average of 95,341 monthly mortgage approvals for house purchases in the seven months up to and including February 2021, the strongest level since 2007. More recent indicators suggest this momentum has continued, with the number of UK residential purchases in March 2021 being 102.3% higher than March 2020 and 32.2% higher than February 2021. Rightmove announced that it had recorded its busiest ever day on April 7, 2021, with 9.3 million visits to its website, and attributed this strength to growing optimism in the UK’s economic outlook (in light of the positive vaccine roll-out), the return of low deposit mortgages and the benefit of the stamp duty holiday extension to the end of September 2021. The extension will see no tax levied on the first £500,000 of property purchases until June 20, 2021, with this nil-rate band reducing to £250,000 until September 30, 2021, after which it will revert to £125,000. The provision of affordable housing remains a priority for the Government, with a pledge to invest approximately £12 billion in the construction of affordable homes (as defined by the NPPF as housing for sale or rent for those whose needs are not met by the market) in England between 2021 and 2026 – the largest investment into affordable housing in over a decade. The 2021-2026 program is expected to support the construction of 180,000 homes over five years from 2021 to 2026 and is expected to unlock an additional £38 billion of public/private investment in affordable housing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Demand for housing is driven by a combination of factors, such as the rate of economic growth (both nationally and regionally), the rate of population growth and the increasing number of first-time buyers, the average age and life expectancy of the population, the rate of household formation, the availability and affordability of mortgages, consumer confidence (discussed further below) and the unemployment rate. In addition, the outlook in prices remain strong across different region, representing an increasing opportunity for Keepmoat. ----- The following graph illustrates projected estimates of ASP growth across regions from 2021 to 2025: Source: Savills Residential Property Forecast, March 2021 Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, global GDP is estimated to have fallen 3.5%, with UK GDP declining 9.9%. While current data remains volatile due to the phasing of Government restrictions (UK GDP rose 1.2% in December 2020, fell 2.2% in January 2021, and rose 0.4% in February 2021), the UK economy appears to be recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to a successful vaccine roll-out. Recent forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimate GDP growth at 4.0% in 2021 and envisage that the economy will return to its pre-pandemic levels by Q2 2022. Elsewhere, the labor market continues to be distorted by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (“CJRS”) (with an estimated 4.7 million workers furloughed at the end of February 2021 versus 8.9 million in May 2020), with the ONS estimating the employment rate at 75.1% in February 2021 (1.4% down year-on-year) and the unemployment rate at 4.9% (0.9% higher year-onyear). Despite this, the OBR estimates that the unemployment rate will peak at 6.5% in Q4 2021 as furlough winds down and improve thereafter. Notably, for the period from January 2021 to March 2021, London had the highest level of unemployment at 6.8%, compared to 5.4% in the North East, 5.0% in the North West, 5.7% and 4.9% for the West and East Midland regions respectively, and a low of 3.4% in the South-East. The following graph sets forth the estimated growth in UK GDP and estimated unemployment rate through 2025: Source: Statista, 2021 ----- There have also been early signs of recovery in wage growth since the end of lockdown. In contrast to past periods of economic stress, the housing market has seen renewed momentum since May 2020, with many commentators attributing this to the release of pent-up demand and changing household preferences instigated by the COVID-19 pandemic.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

The Bank of England is predicting increased consumer confidence with the easing of restrictions on economic activity and households expected to spend around 10% of their additional accumulated savings over the next three years. The GFK Consumer Confidence Index rose to a 13-month high in April 2021, its highest level since the start of the pandemic.

UK Finance, a trade association for the UK banking and financial services sector, estimates that UK gross mortgage lending to £233 billion in 2020, representing a 13% decline from the prior year, and forecasts that it will fall to £215 billion in 2021 before recovering to £230 billion by 2022. However, recent mortgage approval data points to a stronger situation, with approvals in the seven months up to and including February 2021 averaging 95,053. This is 41% ahead of the comparative period a year earlier, which was undisturbed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nationwide estimates that first-time buyers spent an average of 31.7% of mean take-home pay on mortgage payments in Q4 2020. This compares to the average since 1984 of 33.1%, a low of 17.5% in 1996 and a high of 56% in 1989, as demonstrated by the following graph showing UK mortgage rates between 1995 and 2021: (1) Monthly interest rate of UK monetary financial institutions (excluding Central Bank) sterling 75% LTV fixed rate mortgage to households, not seasonally adjusted.

This has resulted in planning approvals for residential development in England rising toward 400,000 per annum, which compares to just over 200,000 completions across the entirety of the United Kingdom in 2019 and an average of 164,301 per annum in the five years up to and including 2012. This shift in the supply/demand dynamic has led to much more moderate land prices. Whilst UK house prices are approximately 30% higher than their pre2008 peak, UK greenfield and urban land values are only back to 90% and 80% respectively of their peak 2007 values.

The same percentage discount must then be passed on with the sale of the property to future buyers (who must also be first-time buyers), meaning that homes will always be sold at a discount to market value in perpetuity, with the aim of benefitting local communities, local workers and key workers and families. After the discount has been applied, the first sale must be at a price no higher than £250,000 (or £420,000 in Greater London). Changes proposed to the planning system to support this initiative may require that First Homes properties should account for at least 25% of all affordable housing units secured through developer contributions.

A vision for ‘Homes of the future’ was laid out within the Conservative Party pledges, with an intended incorporation of innovative design and technology noted as methods to address environmental considerations. The proposed Part L and Future Homes standard in the building regulations will reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of running a home, but will be more expensive to build. A primary focus remains to further prioritize brownfield site developments and protect the Green belt through enhanced biodiversity and improvements to poor land quality. The proposed 10% ‘Bio Diversity Net Gain’ element of the Environment Bill could inadvertently increase the cost of developing brownfield land due to it becoming dense, self-seeded vegetation over the decades it has been left vacant. This land is regarded as having a higher bio diversity value, than greenfield land and therefore achieving the proposed net gain is potentially more costly.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.36,Regulatory Environment,17.36.1,,"One of the key regulatory regimes that UK housebuilders must adhere to are those that concern planning permissions for residential developments. In England and Wales, the majority of spatial planning is regulated by the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. All developments, except for those which are permitted pursuant to permitted development rights, require planning consent by the relevant local planning authority. Planning consent is obtained through the preparation and submission of a planning application, which in some circumstances may include an environmental statement prepared as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process. The planning application is considered by the local planning authority following consultation with relevant stakeholders, having regard to national and local planning policies, environmental impacts and other material considerations. There are two types of planning consent that can be obtained. The first, known as outline planning consent, is typically sought for the development of greenfield sites or larger sites requiring development in phases. An application for outline planning permission allows for a decision on the general principles of how a site can be developed. Outline planning permission is granted subject to conditions requiring the subsequent approval of one or more “reserved matters.” Reserved matters are those aspects of the development which an application can choose not to submit details of with an outline planning permission. These include aspects such as appearances and layout. The second, known as full planning consent, grants detailed consent for the development. Planning consents are granted subject to various conditions which must be complied with at certain points throughout the delivery of a development. Some planning conditions require certain information to be provided to and approved by the local planning authority prior to certain works being undertaken. In addition, all planning permissions are granted subject to the development commencing within a certain period of time, failure of which results in the lapsing of the planning consent. In the case of most developments, local planning authorities require that housebuilders enter into Section 106 agreements prior to the grant of planning consent in order to make such developments acceptable in planning ----- terms. These agreements govern a developer’s commitments to build affordable housing and infrastructure, in addition to providing other community benefits. Obligations under these agreements could include financial contributions towards local infrastructure (including schools, roads and healthcare facilities) that are needed as a result of increased demand brought about by the development. Additional obligations could include affordable housing contributions, which may take place either through an on-site requirement for the housebuilder to build an agreed amount of affordable housing or payment of a commuted sum. The level of affordable housing contributions is often set within local authority planning policy but can be renegotiated on specific grounds. Section 106 agreements must be entered into by the owner of the land for which the related planning permission relates. As the obligations contained within such agreements run with the land and (subject to any exclusions agreed with the local planning authority), they are enforceable against subsequent owners of the land. In England and Wales, housebuilders may also be required to pay a Community Infrastructure Levy charge typically intended to contribute to the wider infrastructure of an area in which a site is located. Given the complexity and localized nature of the land planning system, the overall process is usually considered risky, time consuming and expensive. Following a consultation process launched in August 2020 which was aimed at reforming the planning system, the Government is expected to bring a new planning bill before the UK Parliament in Autumn 2021. Some of the key areas under consideration are: - consulting local communities from the beginning of the planning process; - harnessing the latest technology through online maps and data in order to ensure the planning system is more accessible; - ensuring local plans are developed and agreed in 30 months – down from the current average of seven years – so that homes may be built more quickly; - overhauling the current planning process with a clearer, rules-based system. Under the current system, approximately one third of planning cases that go to appeal are overturned at appeal; and - replacing the existing systems for funding affordable housing and infrastructure with a new, more predictable, and more transparent levy. In July 2021, the Government introduced its long anticipated Building Safety Bill (which is applicable in England, although some of the changes will also apply to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland). The Building Safety Bill has not yet made its way through the UK Parliament, and it is anticipated that this will take at least nine months from the introduction of the bill and possibly longer. Thereafter, the changes will come into force incrementally. The Building Safety Bill has been introduced to strengthen the regulatory system for building safety, change industry culture to foster a greater emphasis on safety and accountability, implement rigorous safety standards for construction products, and provide a clearer path to redress for homeowners. The main elements of the Building Safety Bill include: - overhauling the regulatory landscape for the design and construction of high risk residential buildings that are 18 meters or have at least seven stories and two residential units and their subsequent occupation, management and operation; - establishing a building safety regulator and updating existing building safety regulations; - establishing a new framework to provide national oversight of construction products and strengthening the powers of the Office for Product Safety and Standards in this area; - establishing a new homes ombudsman and simplifying the process to log complaints to the Housing Ombudsman Service for social housing tenants; - making financial provisions to support the removal of unsafe cladding, including through a levy on developers seeking permission to develop certain high rise buildings in England; and - strengthening the enforcement action that can be taken in the event of breach including in relation to criminal offences for non-compliance. ----- Impact assessments undertaken by the Government indicate that the reforms will cost the industry more than £1 billion in their first three years. This is not inclusive of the levy referred to above, nor is it inclusive of the proposed new tax for the UK residential property development sector (which also serves to meet cladding remediation costs). The proposed new tax will apply to residential developers’ profits over £25 million and the Government anticipates raising at least £2 billion over a decade. The Government is currently in consultations to determine the structure of the tax scheme ahead of its inclusion in Finance Bill 2021-22. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Sustainability is also a key driver of our operations, with a particular focus on community-building and place making. In July 2020, following stakeholder consultation, we published our Sustainability Strategy in which we identified our material issues and aligned our strategy to eight SDGs. Through our Sustainability Strategy, we have committed to minimizing our impact on the environment and biodiversity. In particular, we have announced that we intend to achieve a net zero carbon position by the mid-2040s (having formally committed to Race to Zero) and that we intend to publicly disclose our carbon performance from 2022 onwards. We were active on 94 sites as of July 31, 2021. In addition, as of July 31, 2021, the number of plots within our land pipeline was 24,654, with approximately 81% of our land pipeline, or 19,933 plots, being legally secured (meaning that we have a contractual right to develop or a conditionally exchanged contract). As of July 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our land pipeline, or 4,721 plots, were those on which we had been appointed preferred developer (meaning that we had been chosen by the land vendor as the final candidate to progress to contract for the development of the site). Together, these plots are equivalent to a six-year supply of homes, based on our pre-pandemic annual completion levels. As of July 31, 2021, we had a forward order book of approximately £503 million (representing 3,151 plots) with an open market sales rate of 0.77 for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021. As of September 19, 2021, we had reserved, exchanged or legally completed almost all of our planned sales for the financial year ending October 31, 2021. Furthermore, as of September 19, 2021, we had secured approximately 40% of our planned sales for the year ended October 31, 2022, 85% of our planned sales for the three months ended January 31, 2022, and 45% of our planned sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022. As of September 19, 2021, we had an eight-week rolling average rate of 0.93, demonstrating continued strong demand from our customers. Our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 were £628.5 million and £73.8 million, respectively. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data.” Over the same period, we generated Free Cash Flow of £44.1 million (and free cash flow conversion of 59.8%). The resilience of our business model was demonstrated through the COVID-19 pandemic. Working with our partners, we were able to agree a deferral of 89% of committed and uncommitted land spend, without losing any site investment opportunities as a result. We believe our financial results in recent quarters demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our business model. ----- Our focus on partnerships provides us with an attractive financial model, benefitting from typically lower land values, attractive (and often deferred) payment terms, the potential for additional elective deals with Registered Providers (beyond sales in connection with Section 106 affordable housing obligations) and access to grant funding to optimize returns.

We are focused on creating sustainable communities in places where people want to live, and we specialize in the delivery of affordable and high quality homes, principally targeted at first-time buyers. Headquartered in Doncaster, England, we operate across England and Scotland through nine operating regions. We are a top ten UK housebuilder, measured by the number of homes sold, including delivering 4,035 homes in our financial year ended October 31, 2019. Unlike traditional housebuilders, our business model is based on partnerships with entities interested in seeing an increase in supply of homes as well as those with demand for our product. These partners are primarily land owners (such as Homes England, Local Authorities and private land owners) or Registered Providers, which include the traditional not-for-profit and the newer for-profit entities that are registered with the Regulator of Social Housing to provide affordable housing. We engage each of our key stakeholders in residential projects by establishing, aligning and prioritizing their needs and successfully delivering their objectives. We have built our reputation by aligning our approach to our partners’ objectives regarding the sourcing, procurement, planning and delivery of successful, affordable housing developments that create significant social value. We believe that we are the original partnership-focused housebuilder in the United Kingdom, having worked with over 200 partners to date, with many of these relationships enduring for over 20 years. Our partnership model allows us to have a high degree of certainty over our land pipeline, with sufficient land secured for six years of development based on our future development plans and on 2019 home deliveries, while also typically allowing us to defer payment until milestones are met. We are also able to minimize development and planning risks by partnering with land owners through the early stages of a development project. Coupled with the relatively low land costs for the affordable homes that we target, we are able to operate a capitallight business model relative to traditional housebuilders, and generate relatively strong cash conversion and ROCE. In the financial year ended October 31, 2019, the last full financial year prior to the start of the COVID19 pandemic, our ROCE was 32.8%. We focus on developing urban and suburban locations where there is an inherent demand and supply imbalance for new homes. We aim to meet this demand through our five core standard house type ranges. This standardization allows efficiency in procuring materials and construction, increased certainty of cost and timing of delivery, and assists in establishing optimal site layout mix based on demand and our partners’ preferences. We are continually working with new technologies that underpin and refine our designs. We are committed to deliver a range of affordable housing, predominantly for open market sale, social housing and shared ownership – which provides us with a higher degree of market resilience over the long term due to generally consistent demand from first-time buyers and well-funded Registered Providers. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, approximately 74% of our sales were on the open market (which includes sales to private customers as well as elective sales to Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a site), with the remaining approximately 26% of our sales comprising sales to Registered Providers that are contracted at the outset of development of a site, including but not limited to those contracted to satisfy Section 106 obligations. Approximately 87% of our open market sales in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 were to private sale customers, of which approximately 76% were to first-time buyers (first-time buyers accounted for 76% during the financial year ended October 31, 2019). In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, approximately 45% of our total sales, including 67% of sales to first time buyers, involved the use of the Government HTB scheme. We believe that first-time buyers provide more resilient structural demand than the typically discretionary and cyclical home-mover segment. ----- The following charts show our sales mix (by percentage of total homes delivered) and our private sales customer mix for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021:",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

The UK Government’s position has historically been that everyone should have the opportunity to own an affordable, decent home within a sustainable and mixed community. To this end, support for the housing market and first-time buyers has been a target of government policy over recent years, starting with the introduction of the NPPF in 2012. In its 2021 annual budget, the Government reiterated its pledge to increase the number of new homes built per annum, with the goal of delivering at least one million additional homes through this parliamentary cycle. Overall, the Government has a target to build 300,000 homes per year through the mid-2020s (as announced in the Budget 2017), and we expect there to be continued support for the housebuilding sector as the Government seeks to achieve this target. The following chart shows the number of homes completed by private sector and public sector funding, as compared to the Government target of 300,000 per year. In particular, the first-time buyer market outside of London, our core target market, is aided by a supportive structural and political backdrop promoting both home ownership and affordable housing, including through UK central Government funds, loans, grants and subsidies, which assist in both the viability of schemes and also pace of delivery. As demonstrated by the recently launched “First Homes” program, which offers firsttime buyers a minimum 30% discount on the purchase of a new build home, we expect this segment to continue to be a key focus area for the UK government in the future. This has contributed to a rise in housebuilding completions to 178,310 in England in the year ended December 31, 2019, the highest level since 2007. This is, however, far below the 300,000 per year needed in England as estimated by the UK Government in early 2021 despite the macro-economic uncertainty created by the pandemic. As household formation continues to rise and the pandemic has reinforced buyer preferences for houses over flats, we have experienced a strong recovery in 2021 to date. ----- The demand backdrop for housing remains supportive with the continued increase in UK household formation. The following chart shows the number of homes in the UK since 2011, as of June 29, 2020, with 20212039 data estimates completed by private sector and public sector funding, as compared to the Government target of 300,000 per year. (6) Office for national statistics While it is not currently known whether the HTB scheme will be extended after 2023, what modifications to any extensions may be, or if other government support for the sector may be put in place, we believe the Government will remain focused on supporting those purchasers who form our key customer base. For instance, when the HTB scheme was modified and extended to March 2023, reforms were implemented to restrict the scheme to support only first-time buyers from April 1, 2021 onwards and with regional price caps from £186,100 in the North East to £600,000 in London. As our ASP was £162,000 in the year ended October 31, 2019, we believe this modification will have little to no adverse impact for our business. Our ASP compares favorably for entry price point customers when compared to our listed peers. Further, based on our ability to navigate recent changes to the Scottish equivalent of the HTB scheme, we do not believe that any termination of the HTB scheme would have a material effect on the demand for our homes in England. In Scotland, the “Affordable New Build Scheme” remains available to larger housebuilders (including Keepmoat), though it stopped accepting new applications on February 5, 2021. The suspension of new applications has had no major impact on our performance in the region, which we believe is primarily a result of our target market dynamics, competitive entry price point and strong reputation as a 5-Star Homebuilder.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Key attractions of this market segment include resilience in adverse macroeconomic environments, the greatest affordability levels in terms of income/price ratios and one of the strongest growth rates in historical and forecast volumes. This segment is also conducive to strong partnerships with land owners such as Homes England and other local authorities, as well as delivery partners, including Registered Providers, in their role as agents for the implementation of Government housing policies driven by social objectives. As a result, we have achieved consistently strong sales rates in recent years, outperforming more broadly focused housebuilders. From April 2017 to July 2021, Keepmoat has achieved an average open market sales rate per outlet per week of 0.82, which is above the broader housing sector’s average open market sales rate per outlet per week of 0.66. ----- The following charts illustrate the demographic breakdown of our private sales customers, including by purchase type, age, employment type, occupation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Figures do not always add to 100% due to rounding. First-time private buyers are a segment that has historically been resilient as purchases are more frequently driven by a “need to buy” rather than the typically discretionary and cyclical home-mover segment. Most first-time buyers also see a financial benefit to purchasing as compared to renting, with average mortgage payments in the UK approximately 18% lower than the cost of renting a private two-bedroom home (based on 2020 average payments). In addition to personal life cycle reasons, this provides a financial incentive to purchase even in economic downturns. First-time buyers accounted for 76% of our sales to private customers in the financial year ended October 31, 2020, while only 50% and 51% of all home purchase loans obtained in the UK in 2020 and 2019, respectively, were for first-time buyers.

Unlike traditional housebuilders, we primarily develop in collaboration with partners that have some form of long-term continuing interest (either through ownership or social responsibility) in the relevant development. We are a partner of land owners such as Homes England and other Local Authorities, as well as delivery partners, including Registered Providers of affordable housing, strategically catering to structural demand driven by social objectives and Government housing policies. Partnership relationships promote effective and capital light land sourcing and site development (often with deferred payment terms correlated to the pace of site development and unit sales), as well as the ability to unlock development sites often inaccessible to traditional housebuilders. Unlike the traditional model, the partnership model offers an attractive financial profile with lower land acquisition costs, favorable (often deferred) payment terms, cash generative and competitively priced deals with Registered Providers, access to grant funding and accelerated delivery, enabling us to pursue investments with an attractive ROCE. ----- The following chart provides an illustration of the lifecycle of a development and key differences in our model. (2) Keepmoat profile based on a sample of sites. Traditional profile based on management’s experience of the UK housebuilding industry. Over the past 25 years, we have developed strong relationships with many of the largest land partners in the UK, which are predominantly public land owners but also include private land owners, and have built a strong reputation for delivery, quality and place making (i.e., creating thriving, sustainable communities where people genuinely want to live, work and play). Relationships are maintained at multiple organizational levels, which help identify future projects and facilitate successful tender processes. This results in a high volume of repeat business and a strong visibility of the order book. Long-standing partner relationships such as ours are inherently difficult to replicate for new entrants. We believe that the partnership model also has a reduced risk profile, as it is fundamentally based on a structural alignment of objectives among ourselves and our partners, which results in pragmatism and flexibility when required. As demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, working with our partners, we were able to agree a deferral of 80% of committed land spend and 97% of forecast uncommitted land spend, without losing any site investment opportunities as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

This focus on product standardization is a key differentiating element of our business model and commercial proposition to our partners, contributing to the creation of a strong brand. To facilitate standardization, we typically utilize our five standard house type ranges, catering to the requirements of private sale, sale to Registered Providers and local authorities, future mobility standards and Scottish building standards (where applicable), which assist in establishing optimal site layout mix based on demand and partner’s preferences. Although it varies from year to year, in the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 88% of our homes were built using standardized housing types. The in-house development process of our portfolio of core standard designs is based on internal feedback for saleability, buildability, customer feedback and land/commercial optimization, and is a key driver of the continued operational improvements across the Group that have resulted in enhanced operating margins. ----- Standardization of house types has enabled us to accurately reflect third party designs (such as heating, roofs, furniture and kitchens) for space and accessibility standards. These standard details allow us to promote best practices for quality, safety and precise material scheduling, optimizing waste as a result. Importantly, standard specifications facilitate forward demand planning, purchase leverage and rebate maximization. It allows contractors to bid aggressively on our projects as they have greater confidence around deliverability on cost and on time. The standardization process has also enhanced the quality of our products which, in turn, has increased customer satisfaction and reduced aftercare costs. The efficiencies across the supply chain and cost control and optimization have strengthened our ability to maintain strong margins and provide a partial defense from cost inflation pressures. This is further enhanced by our disciplined approach through all stages of capital allocation, acquisitions and cost control.

As there is a lag between the securing of land and the ultimate delivery of finished product on that land, we may see benefit from this focus on land acquisition being realized over time. We have a controlled and disciplined internal land acquisition approval process, working within defined control gateways each requiring senior executive and/or Capex Committee approval. Our land approval protocol involves three stages. The Pre-Bid Capex proposal establishes the nature, suitability and targeted financial returns (for gross margin and ROCE) of the opportunity. The Capex 1 Proposal includes a review of planning, title and legal reports, site risks/mitigants and required approvals, with continued focus on delivering in line with the threshold financial returns. Finally, the Capex 2 proposal is the region’s final proposal to develop the site (including financial plan) once all legal matters and major approvals are received. We believe this rigorous land sourcing process, together with sales price optimization, build and sales management and the resulting increasing mix of higher quality and better procured sites, may all be contributing factors driving continued margin expansion. For example, for sites under development that were approved between 2017 and 2019 (excluding the North West MCI region), average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for each year of approval range from approximately 22% to 23% by year, whereas for sites either approved since 2020 or within our secured pipeline and to be approved, average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for each year of approval or for the “to be approved” category, range from approximately 24% to 25% by year or category. This is an increase from the average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for sites under development that were approved in 2016 and pre-2016, for which average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins are approximately 21% and 18%, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

The KM Group’s Adjusted EBIT increased 47.7% from £41.4 million for the financial year ended March 31, 2018 to £61.1 million in the financial year ended October 31, 2019. Inevitably, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact in the KM Group’s financial performance in 2020. However, illustrating the strength and resiliency of our business model, we generated revenues of £628.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of £73.8 million in the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 3.3% and an increase of 18.3%, respectively, as compared to the financial year ended October 31, 2019.

As of July 31, 2021, there were 24,654 plots in our land pipeline, of which approximately 81% were legally secured, meaning that we have a contractual right to develop or a conditionally exchanged contract. This equates to a land pipeline of six years at pre-pandemic annual volumes. We intend to continue to leverage our strong land pipeline and high near-term land visibility to increase delivery volumes. We currently characterize five of our nine regions (the East Midlands, South Midlands, North West MCI, Scotland and West Midlands regions) as “growth regions,” and we believe these regions have significant potential to deliver additional plots within the existing regional management structure as they mature. We will target both continued growth in volume and margin improvement, as the business delivers on regional management team investments that have been made in these growth regions and benefits from the continued realization of land acquired through improved sourcing processes. Approximately 86% of our land pipeline has agreed deferred land payment terms with our partners. Of our land pipeline plots that have been legally secured as of July 31, 2021, approximately 37% represents projects that were not legally completed and there remained conditionality (e.g., planning and groundworks survey) prior to finalizing the contract. There are further risk mitigation opportunities available to us within our partnership model such as land payments made by Registered Provider partners, overage agreements, pace and tenure delivery flexibility and multi-tenure development. The benefits of these risk mitigation features have been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with our strong relationships with partners providing flexibility to recalibrate land and delivery obligations during this challenging period. Altogether, we were able to either defer or pay in alignment with plot delivery £58.4 million of £65.5 million total forecast land payments (89%) from April 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

We intend to continue to focus on ensuring that our customers are supported throughout their house buying journey, meeting their expectations, and providing them with a high-quality new home. Sustainability is core to the partnership business model and we are committed to prioritizing ESG initiatives. Key stakeholders are aligned in their focus with approximately 74% of Local Authorities in the UK declaring a climate and biodiversity change emergency, with regeneration areas often more vulnerable to climate and environmental impacts. We are working with Wildscapes, which is a wildlife trust consultancy, to develop methodologies to support the delivery of a net gain in biodiversity for future developments. We are responsible for placemaking and regeneration which in turn helps create direct and indirect employment opportunities within low-income communities. We are focused on providing affordable, low carbon homes to contribute to delivering on our and our partners’ objectives of improving the environmental sustainability of the UK’s homes. We have committed to a number of near term ESG targets, including: introducing science-based carbon targets aligned to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius along with carbon performance metrics (currently anticipated to be set in late 2021); setting our decarbonisation roadmap within 12 months from July 2021, with the aim of achieving a net zero carbon position by the mid-2040s; mitigating supply chain risks and supporting our supply chain to become more sustainable; and updating our sustainability structure, providing greater oversight and focus on sustainability with the function reporting directly to the CEO and receiving greater focus from the Board.

Since then, we have grown organically and through acquisitions. During the 2008 financial crisis, we came under the ownership of the Lloyds Banking Group, which was then our financial lender. The Lloyds Banking Group exited in 2014, with TDR Capital LLP (“TDR”) and Sun Capital Partners (“Sun”) acquiring controlling interests. Under TDR’s and Sun’s control, we introduced a new management team focused on growing our business, expanding from four regions in 2014 to nine regions as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Our organic growth was enhanced in January 2017 by the acquisition of MCI a developer of social housing projects for local authorities and other Registered Providers, which strengthened our capacity, particularly in the North West of England. Following the acquisition of MCI, we further streamlined our operations, selling our regeneration business to ENGIE for £330 million. With our renewed focus on homebuilding, and the ----- completion of a successful internal restructuring exercise to streamline our regional operations, we obtained 5star Homebuilder status in 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

A Divisional Chairman is responsible for each of the two divisions, supported by a Divisional Finance Director in each division. Our current operational structure was adopted in 2020, following an internal reorganization aimed at optimizing our regional office locations versus our target geographies. We believe that our current divisional structure provides an appropriate span of control for the divisional management team, allowing the right level of oversight for each region to ensure that performance is carefully monitored while maintaining alignment of our overall strategy and growth plans. The following map shows the regions in which we operate and the locations of our regional offices as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, as well as the blended ASP of each region for the nine months ended July 31, 2021. We also have a satellite office located in Bristol, which is part of the West Midlands region. (1) Source: Savills UK Residential Property Forecast (March 2021).

The regions are empowered to deliver the Group’s overarching operational excellence strategy, applying the Group’s policies and systems to ----- local markets and circumstances. The regions have a high degree of autonomy, with clear reporting channels to central management and the ability to share central infrastructure support functions. We believe that this structure and approach means that we are well positioned for future growth in the right locations.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.41,Business Operations,17.41.2,Our Partnership Model,"Our partnership model is central to our approach to development and sets us apart from our competitors. Our partnership model presents the following benefits: - reduced competition for large scale land opportunities; - resilient demand for affordable homes; - capital light approach delivering strong ROCE; and - repeat business through track record and reputation. Unlike traditional housebuilders, we primarily develop in collaboration with partners that have some form of long-term continuing interest (either through ownership or social responsibility) in the relevant development, which are primarily land owners (such as Homes England, Local Authorities and private land owners) and Registered Providers of social housing. We assist our partners in achieving their key goals of regenerating sites that achieve positive social outcomes through the provision of high-quality, affordable housing. Our focus on this segment of the market provides us with significant expertise in the management of regeneration projects, which is a key differentiator between us and most traditional housebuilders. We believe that this model facilitates efficient, effective and capital light land sourcing and site development, while also enhancing returns and mitigating market and development risks. The following chart provides a comparison of certain key differences between our partnership model and the traditional housebuilding method: (1) Traditional housebuilders includes Barratt Developments plc, Bellway plc, The Berkeley Group Holdings plc, Crest Nicholson Holdings plc, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc, Taylor Wimpey plc, Vistry Group plc. ----- (2) Land cost is calculated as land cost as a percentage of ASP. (3) Asset turn calculated as Group Revenue divided by average opening and closing tangible net operating asset value. (4) Targets are provided for illustrative purposes only. This illustration does not purport to reflect the current returns on any particular site or for the Group as a whole or the potential returns that could be achieved on any particular site or the Group as a whole. These are medium term targets only and not a profit forecast. There can be no assurance that these targets can or will be met and it should not be seen as an indication of the Group’s expected or actual results or returns. Some of our partner agreements facilitate the drawdown of land under phased viability assessments. These forms of agreements accounted for approximately 19% of our land pipeline as of July 31, 2021, and see large development opportunities broken down into phases, with the land for each phase being appraised and valued at the time that we are ready to develop it. Payment terms are also agreed and drawn down once we are ready to develop that phase, and are therefore based on the prevailing market conditions at the time. This allows us to assess the performance of a prior phase before we commit and agree to payment terms and a land valuation for the following phase. The characteristics of phased viability schemes help to reduce the working capital requirements of each project, limit our market and planning risk (including exposure to unexpected land cost depreciation) and allow us to mitigate any exposure to challenging partner specifications or cost inflation related to construction and materials. For our other partner agreements, land is purchased from our partners as a single site, with the land value and payment terms (often deferred) agreed at the completion of the deal. We complement this approach with a build timescale that matches our sales patterns. Below is an illustrative comparison of the cash profile of our partnership model through the life of a site, compared with that of traditional housebuilding companies: As of July 31, 2021, our land pipeline comprised 24,654 plots equating to six years of land supply at prepandemic volumes. The composition of the land pipeline is as follows: - 19% is that which we categorize as “preferred developer” status, where we have been chosen by the land vendor as the final candidate to progress to contract for the development of the site. - 30% is secured with a conditional contract, often subject to planning approval and ground condition resolution. Consolidating these first two categories, 49% of the pipeline is made up of sites on which we have some conditionality prior to finalizing the contract. - The residual 51% is land on which we have legally completed the purchase or securing of the site. Our legally secured plots have certain features which mitigate certain risks associated with developing the plots. These features include (i) deferred payment terms, which are often correlated to the pace of delivery; (ii) land payments that are made by Registered Provider partners; (iii) low base land costs through negotiation and the inclusion of an overage share; (iv) pace and tenure delivery flexibility, which is particularly significant during periods of market slowdown; and (v) opportunities for multi-tenure delivery. ----- _Land Creditor Commitments_ Our partnership model seeks to enhance returns and mitigate risk by reducing upfront investment in the land through deferred payment terms, payments on a per-plot basis, payments triggered by cumulative plot sales or similar development milestones (that may or may not include specified backstop dates) and deferred land tranche payments. As of July 31, 2021, 86% of our land pipeline was purchased with land payments to be made on deferred terms. We believe that our land creditor profile provides us with an element of risk mitigation, as the majority of our payments are linked to development delivery milestones rather than needing to be made up front. Our land creditor commitments are unwound as the relevant payments for these deferred land costs fall due and are made from period to period. The following chart shows the amount of land creditor commitments as of July 31, 2021, that we expect to unwind during each of the periods indicated: In addition, some of our arrangements with development partners include overage mechanisms, whereby we may make additional payments to our development partner following completion of the land sale contingent upon exceeding agreed financial thresholds, with payments often deferred to the end of the development of the site or of a significant phase of the site. Together, these deferred payment obligations and overage obligations comprise our land creditor commitments. We believe that our land creditor profile, which is inherent to our partnership model, provides us with an element of risk mitigation as the majority of our payments are linked to development delivery milestones rather than needing to be made up front. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments.”_ The following table shows the breakdown of our land creditor commitments, by contract terms, as of July 31, 2021: #### Total Contract Terms (in millions of £) Fixed Date Liabilities .........................................................................  41.7 Overage (Determined)........................................................................  8.6 Sub Total ............................................................................................  50.3 Milestone Payments – with Backstop ................................................  70.7 Milestone Payments – without Backstop ...........................................  28.4 Overage (Not yet determined) ............................................................  60.1 Other ..................................................................................................  8.4 Sub Total ............................................................................................  167.6 Total .................................................................................................. 217.9 As of July 31, 2021, the majority of our land creditor commitments were to Homes England (43%) and ----- Local Authorities (34%), with the remainder to other partners (13%) and private vendors (11%).

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.41,Business Operations,17.41.3,Our Partners,"We leverage our long-term partner relationships to both access target sites and proactively identify delivery partners for development opportunities. As of July 31, 2021, 79% of the plots in our land pipeline were being developed under the partnership model. Our partners include public and private sector land owners as well as Registered Providers. In particular, we benefit from strong, long-standing relationships with public bodies (including Homes England, Local Authorities and charitable organizations, and Registered Providers) and private land owners. These relationships have been built using our successful track-record of delivering projects, our reputation for aligning our approach with our partners’ objectives, our established national scale and our deep understanding of the motivations beyond financial returns that are important to our partners (including social value, sustainability, accelerated delivery and design quality). We have established a track record of doing repeat business with a growing number of partners. Our partners select housebuilders that can help them deliver their housing, economic, social and environmental goals. Choosing a developer who can (a) repurpose brownfield land into well-designed schemes of affordable, high-quality homes, (b) regenerate neglected, derelict areas into thriving mixed tenure communities that are socially and economically inclusive, and (c) deliver this in a way that enhances the public realm and biodiversity and reduces carbon outputs which is at the forefront of partners’ objectives. In order to successfully operate our partnership model, it is imperative that we understand our partners’ goals and maintain and promote strong relationships and a strong reputation for delivery. Our reputation and understanding of these features contributes to our strong forward pipeline of projects and our competitive advantage. We believe that this understanding, alongside our extensive experience with the public procurement process and proven regeneration expertise, provides us with a significant competitive advantage. Furthermore, our partnership oriented focus allows us to remain closely aligned with Government housing policy and our close work with various levels of government allows us to participate in a wide range of pilot projects and government consultation initiatives. Working with these partners provides us with the potential to access grant funding and investment support (particularly from Homes England and Local Authority partners) to facilitate the development of land that would otherwise be unviable to develop. As a result of the structured and lengthened timelines that we operate under while working with our partners, we are able to carry out extensive due diligence and thorough evaluations of the technical and economic feasibility of a project development before committing to a land value, which in turn serves as an important risk mitigation tool. Conversely, in traditional development and in speculative transactions, the due diligence and evaluation of a site is often undertaken in a compressed timeframe so that the site can be acquired before the vendor has the opportunity to sell the site to another prospective purchaser. Registered Providers are experts in delivering multi-tenure housing, which may include social rent, affordable rent, market rent and shared ownership homes in a single development. We believe that a multi-tenure housing offer is essential in order to regenerate and deliver truly sustainable communities and this acts as a driving factor as to why we work with delivery partners including Registered Providers. In addition, creating multi-tenure communities allows us to diversify our revenue streams among various demographics and through shared ownership, outright sale and private rented homes. ----- Our largest delivery partner is Homes England, the non-departmental public body that provides funding and land to the housing sector to deliver the Government’s housing policies. Similarly, we are one of the largest strategic delivery partners of Homes England. Our relationship with Homes England (and its predecessors) extends over two decades and across all of its operating regions. Our relationship with Homes England has included support in matters related to the sourcing of land, infrastructure funding, the accessing of grants to assist in developing otherwise unviable sites, funding affordable housing programs and participation in the Help to Buy scheme. We have also participated in piloting new Government initiatives and providing input on policy consultations. We are a member of Homes England’s current DPP (“DPP3”), which was set up to facilitate public sector bodies bringing public land to the market. We have been a member of all of Homes England’s DPPs to date and are one of the most active developers on DPP3. Having been a member of each of the DPPs, we have extensive knowledge and understanding of the bid process, assessment criteria and delivery requirements, which in turn provides us with a significant competitive advantage when bidding on sites offered by Homes England. As of July 31, 2021, we had secured approximately 9,223 homes, across 38 sites through the successive DPPs. In June 2021 we applied to be part of Homes England’s new “dynamic purchasing system” and received confirmation in early September 2021 that our application had been successful. This system was designed to modernize the bidding process through the use of a digital platform, simplifying the process for housebuilders to join the list of preferred developers and bid for land, and is due to be used for land procurement from Autumn 2021 onwards. We are also a registered investment partner of Homes England, which gives us the ability to apply for affordable housing grants alongside Registered Providers. Homes England also provides development finance, long-term infrastructure funding and grant funding to both the housing sector and Local Authority partners to facilitate housing outputs. Since 2009, we have directly and indirectly benefitted from approximately £450 million of funding initiatives from Homes England to facilitate the delivery of new development sites and homes.

Approximately 79% of the plots in our land pipeline as of July 31, 2021 were being developed under the partnership model. The remainder of our homes are planned to be developed under speculative land deals whereby we purchase land to then develop sites on our own. We have a presence across much of the UK (excluding the greater London area, Wales, southern home counties and directly west and north west of London) and were one of the top-ten UK housebuilders from 2018 to 2020 (measured by the number of homes sold), delivering a total of 3,988 homes in the twelve months ended October 31, 2018, 4,035 homes in the financial year ended October 31, 2019, 2,460 homes in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 (reflecting the impact of COVID-19 during the second half of the financial year ended October 31, 2020) and 3,652 homes in the twelve months ended July 31, 2021. We focus on building homes with standardized designs, which in turn contributes to design and building efficiencies and quality control. Our designs are also relatively straightforward to build and sell, as they do not involve high rise buildings, complex construction methods or cladding. Our homes typically have two to four bedrooms, with 25% of our plots as of October 31, 2020 consisting of two bedroom homes, 59% consisting of three bedroom homes and 13% consisting of four bedroom homes. Of those private homes which achieved legal completion in the financial year ended October 31, 2020, approximately 57% were semi-detached houses, 15% were detached houses, 11% were end of terrace houses, 10% were mid-terrace houses and 7% were apartments. The following chart illustrates our housing portfolio and the ASP for each type of home for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 based on private legal completions in that period: Our homes are primarily aimed at first-time buyers and social landlords, with an average selling price of £161,000 for the financial year ended October 31, 2019, £165,000 for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 and £174,000 for the nine months ended July 31, 2021. Our customers are primarily private purchasers and Registered Providers. Open-market sales (including elective sales to Registered Providers agreed during the development of the sites) represented 75% of the total plots that we sold in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 (with an average selling price of £175,000 over the same period). The remaining 25% were sold to Registered Providers as part of the Section 106 affordable housing obligations in connection with the planning consent for the sites, or otherwise agreed with Registered Providers at the outset of development. Registered Providers are the main providers of new homes in the UK social housing sector and are part-funded by the Government. We have a proven track record of revitalizing communities through the delivery of high-quality homes in well-designed and well-connected neighborhoods and at prices that customers can afford. Over the past 25 years we have successfully delivered new homes in some of UK’s most challenging housing markets, demonstrating our commitment to delivery even in the most demanding market conditions. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 71% of our legal completions were situated in areas falling within the most deprived 30% of the UK, based on the Indices of Multiple Deprivation. ----- Brownfield sites represented 73% of our legal completions in the financial year ended October 31, 2020. Brownfield land is typically characterized by high population density, proven demand and a shortage of housing supply, and is often equipped with infrastructure (public transport, schools and shops).

This obligation is often a condition to planning consent for a particular site, and is set out in each case through a Section 106 agreement. Social housing that must be delivered through a Section 106 agreement is ineligible for Affordable Homes Programme funding and, as a result, Registered Providers generally purchases these homes at a significant discount to their open market value. This discount is factored into our land appraisal at the outset of the development. Registered providers typically pay for these homes incrementally as the site is developed. ----- - _Registered Provider sales, in addition to Section 106 obligations, agreed at the outset of _development of a site (categorized as Registered Provider sales): These sales represent_ agreements (agreed at the outset of development) to sell all or a proportion of the homes on a site to a Registered Provider as part of our strategy for purchasing and developing a site, in addition to any Section 106 obligations. As these sales are in addition to any social housing obligations under Section 106 agreements, they are eligible for Affordable Housing Programme funding, which helps generate attractive commercial offers from the Registered Provider. Registered providers typically pay for these homes incrementally as the site is developed. - _Elective Registered Provider sales agreed during the development of a site (categorized as open _market sales): These are sales agreed with Registered Providers after the development of a site_ has already commenced. Had each such sale not been made, we would otherwise have sold the home to a private buyer as part of our overall open market selling activity for the site. The decision to agree this form of sale is based on the specific economics of each potential Registered Provider elective sale, as benchmarked against other open market sale opportunities. These sales are particularly useful in periods where the residential housing market has slowed, or where a site is less attractive on the open market than otherwise predicted. As these elective sales are in addition to any Section 106 obligations, the Registered Provider is able to access Affordable Homes Programme funding, which helps generate attractive commercial offers. Registered Providers typically pay for these units through a deposit with the balance paid upon completion. Our work with Registered Providers provides us with a number of benefits, including: - a capital efficient work stream, as Registered Providers often pay incrementally and in advance of their homes being built (often with a significant upfront deposit), which thereby strengthens each project’s ROCE; - the multi-tenure housing (including shared ownership homes) that we offer to Registered Providers serves as a natural complement to our private sales; - Registered Providers are well funded by the Government and have delivery commitments to fulfil in a defined period of time; and - in addition to our developments with Registered Providers pursuant to Section 106 obligations or pursuant to build agreements at the outset of a site development, we have found that Registered Providers’ strong appetite for homes generally provide us with an opportunity to make additional elective sales during the period of development, on commercial terms that are in line with a home’s full open market value. The benefits of our partnership model and our work with Registered Provides have been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with our strong relationships with partners providing flexibility to recalibrate land and delivery obligations during this challenging period. Altogether, we were able to either defer or pay in alignment with plot delivery £58.4 million of £65.5 million total forecast land payments (89%) from April 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020.

The development, which was launched in October 2016, is a 15 hectare development of 425 homes, located in a deprived community in Salford. The development will include two hectares of green space, amounting to 13% of the total area of the development. 85 homes at the site, equating to 20% of the total homes developed, will be affordable homes. The project is expected to complete in June 2024. Environmental benefits at the site include the creation of a Sand Martin nesting colony on the riverbank and 99% of waste being diverted from the landfill. The sites environmental benefits have received notable recognition, having been shortlisted for the BIG Biodiversity Award for NEET (not in education, employment or training) horticultural project. - _Primrose Lodge, Goscote: Primrose Lodge is a brownfield development project that we have undertaken together with Walsall Housing Group (selected through its DPP). The development, which was launched in November 2019, is a 11.9 hectare development of 407 homes, located in a deprived community in Goscote, Walsall, on the site of a former interwar housing estate. 126 homes at the site, equating to 31% of the site’s total homes, will be affordable homes. The project is expected to complete in May 2026. Environmental benefits at the site include: (i) no net loss of biodiversity through native species planning in woodlands and public open spaces; (ii) sustainable drainage ponds providing amphibian habitats and local species nesting boxes and habitation; (iii) the inclusion of an electric vehicle charging point in all homes; (iv) sustainable drainage designed for a one in one hundred year flood plus 40% climate change adaptation; and (v) 99% of waste being diverted from the landfill. Social benefits include a commitment to providing work placements, school support, construction college support and apprenticeships, with 44 jobs having already been created to date. - _Waterside, Leicester: Waterside is a brownfield development project that we have undertaken together with Leicester City Council, and which represents our first major scheme in the city. The development, which was launched in November 2019, is a 6.95 hectare development of 288 homes, located in a deprived community near Leicester city center on a site formerly occupied by an industrial estate and cement batching plant. The site will include a 79 bedroom extra care facility. The project is expected to complete in April 2026. Environmental benefits at the site include: (i) a low carbon homes specification that generates 5% lower emissions when compared to building regulations; (ii) a design to achieve zero net loss of biodiversity; (iii) sustainable drainage to prevent localized flooding in a high flood risk area; and (iv) 99% of waste being diverted from the landfill. Social benefits include (i) the creation of 88 work placements to date along with nineteen full-time jobs that will continue to exist after development has completed; (ii) a commitment to create three apprenticeships; and (iii) the creation of a “World of Work” program that will be delivered to construction students at Leicester College. - _Seacroft Hospital, Leeds: Seacroft Hospital is a brownfield development project that we have undertaken together with Homes England. The development, which was launched in December 2016, is an 18.7 hectare development of 503 homes, located in a deprived community near Leeds (a community which is ranked in the bottom twentieth percentile in the UK index of multiple deprivation), on a former hospital site. The site will include 15% affordable homes, with 15% built to lifetime homes standards. The project is expected to be complete in October 2022. Environmental benefits at the site include: (i) a low carbon homes specification that has 20% lower emissions and 10% lower energy requirements when compared to building regulations; (ii) 2.7 hectares of public open space, with ecologically sensitive features including species habitats and 277 trees; (iii) the inclusion of an electric vehicle charging point in all homes with off-road parking; and (iv) 98% of waste being diverted from the landfill. Social benefits include the development of active travel routes linking to the Bradford Leeds Cycle Superhighway and links to the Primrose Valley park.

These requirements are most common when working with Local Authorities on large-scale projects that involve multi-year, multi-phase development and land draw-downs. These joint venture opportunities generally allow us to obtain exclusivity on land within certain areas, limiting competition and boosting land security over an extended period of time. We currently have three active joint ventures: - _Durham Villages Regeneration Limited (“Durham Regeneration”): Durham Regeneration is a 50/50 joint venture that we entered into with Durham Council in 2003. It is our longest standing joint venture. The original purpose of Durham Regeneration was to regenerate the former coal mining villages and towns around Durham City. Durham Regeneration now operates across the county. Discussions are ongoing with Durham County Council regarding potential future sites. - _Sheffield Housing Company (“Sheffield Housing”): Sheffield Housing was incorporated in 2011 and is 50% owned by Sheffield City Council, 45% owned by us and 5% owned by Great Places, a Registered Provider. We typically provide the build and sales capability to Sheffield Housing under a contract for a set return, which serves as a low-risk source of revenue. We are also then eligible for dividends as a shareholder of Sheffield Housing, thereby also benefitting from any upside potential in the developments. - _New Tyne West Development Company LLP (“New Tyne”): New Tyne was incorporated in 2011 and is 50% owned by Newcastle City Council and 50% owned by BK Scotswood LLP. BK Scotswood LLP is in turn a joint venture subsidiary that was originally 50% owned by us, and 50% owned by Barratt Developments, which is a company engaged in residential property development. In December 2020, we acquired Barratt Developments’ 50% interest in BK Scotswood LLP.

We source land for our business from both public and private sector partners. We believe that by understanding bid briefs and being agile and resourceful in delivering on the land vendors’ requirements, we make ourselves an attractive partner. Our largest source of land (currently representing approximately 79% of our land) are our partnerships with the public sector, typically Homes England and Local Authorities, with whom we have formed strong relationships and strategic private partners, with whom we achieve a high proportion of repeat business. We also source land from the private sector through our regional contacts with individual land owners and land agents (which currently represent approximately 21% of our land). With both public and private partners, our participation in a partnership development may be structured in several ways, each of which is intended to provide a blend of risk and return appropriate to the land being acquired. Certain arrangements may require us to acquire the land being developed (sometimes in phases). Other arrangements may grant us with development rights while the original land owner retains ownership of the site and ultimately transfers completed units directly to the home purchaser. In some instances, we may also enter into joint ventures with partners to secure exclusive development rights over large scale land holdings, with our longest running joint venture lasting over 25 years. The timelines from identification of a site to beginning its development can vary widely from as little as 12 months to two years or longer, and then the development phase can last for a number of years depending on size and complexity of the project. Public-sector land is usually brought to market through a competitive tender process, determined by the “Find a Tender Service” (“FTS”) (previously the Official Journal of the European Union (“OJEU”)) process, which governs how the public sector disposes of its land assets and procures development services. In the case of Homes England, disposals are currently effected through the DPP (currently DPP3), of which we are a member. Historically, being a member of DPP3 has reduced the number of competitors that we have competed with to secure large scale public land opportunities, providing us with access to development sites typically unavailable to housebuilders who are not members of DPP3. However, Homes England launched its successor to the DPP, the DPDPS, on September 1, 2021, which has been designed to modernize the bidding process through the use of a digital platform which encourages new entrants to the market, and thereby simplifies the process for housebuilders to join the list of preferred developers and bid for land. We have submitted an application to be a member of the DPDPS and have received confirmation of our membership on the panel. With this new system, ----- housebuilders will still have to ‘qualify’ to be able to join the list of preferred developers, but they will be able to apply to join at any time, rather than only upon renewal of the delivery partner panel once every four years, as is currently the case. The public procurement process is a formal, complex and sometimes lengthy process, which, along with the regeneration aspect of most public-sector land and the pricing dynamics of the affordable housing market, deters some larger housebuilders from competing for these opportunities. However, our significant experience with developments of this type and deep knowledge of the financial dynamics and the requirements of these public sector partners allows us to navigate this process efficiently and effectively. We often begin preparations for a scheme bid well before we receive formal notification of a project. Land purchased through the public sector will generally involve multiple phases over an extended timeframe. The typical process and indicative timeframe is as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

The quality of our land pipeline also benefits from our knowledge of, and relationships with, local markets. These factors allow us to successfully work with local planning authorities, and our planning risk is significantly mitigated by the fact that we often partner with partners such as Homes England and Local Authorities, who support us throughout the planning application process. The overall timetable associated with the planning process generally takes approximately 18 months, with the planning committee meeting taking place approximately 16 months after a preferred bidder has been selected.

The bid assessment criteria often include land value, quality of design, use of modern methods of construction (“MMC”) and socio-economic elements (including the use of local supply chains and training and apprenticeship opportunities). A housebuilder’s reputation and track record of delivery will also be a consideration in awarding large scale regeneration projects. The criteria are usually broken down into specific categories, with scores and weightings attached to each. Therefore, developers are generally aware of how bids will be assessed before they are submitted. For example, Homes England typically assesses scheme bids against two core categories, with 50% of the weighting attributed to the financial offer and 50% attributed to design and social value. Local authorities often more evenly weigh the financial offer, design and social value. We tailor our bids in accordance with the bidding criteria that is released for each project, and we believe that we enjoy a significant advantage against many competing bidders by virtue of our deep understanding of the public procurement process, combined with our experience and track record of delivering notable regeneration and development projects aligning with the social goals of public sector partners. Public bodies generally focus on disposing of brownfield land, which typically has lower land value and can therefore provide a greater potential upside upon development (depending on regeneration costs). This contributes to our relatively low average land cost of approximately 11% of sales. Private sector land is often brought to the market through the owner or a land agent working with the owner. We also identify site opportunities directly through land searches and planning leads. These provide the potential for off-market deals where one-on-one negotiation may take place. In both cases, we conduct an initial assessment to filter out opportunities and compete only for those where we believe we have a high chance of successfully securing the site. We have strong relationships with a small number of national private sector land owners with whom we do repeat business, as well as with a number of land agents. The strength of these relationships, which are based on a mutual track record of delivery and understanding of business drivers, has been instrumental in our ability to secure large scale, capital light deals with private sector vendors. In those cases where we are successful in our bid for a project, we are appointed as the preferred developer and each other party will work towards signing a binding contract while we complete additional due diligence, as described below. _Approval Process and Due Diligence_ Once a potential development opportunity has been identified, we follow a clearly defined due diligence process before we finalize any land purchase. We have a controlled and disciplined internal land acquisition ----- approval process, working within defined control gateways with extensive senior executive review. Our approval process can be divided into three stages: - _Stage 1 — The “Pre-Bid Capital Expenditure” Proposal: This stage occurs prior to the submission of a formal bid or offer for a land parcel, and is intended to establish the financial suitability of an opportunity. The proposal sets out the nature of the opportunity, including scale and scope, and considers the opportunity against our targeted returns for gross margin and ROCE. These target financial returns are then used as benchmarks in stages 2 and 3 of the process (as described below). Our regional teams, led by the regional managing director, complete the “Pre-Bid Capital Expenditure” proposal and present it to the Divisional Chairman for approval. Homes England bids also require approval from the Group Development Director. There is very limited expenditure incurred at this stage of the majority of bids. Approval of a Stage 1 proposal allows the region to perform more detailed planning, design, technical and legal due diligence, as described in Stage 2 below. - _Stage 2 — “Capital Expenditure 1” Proposal: This stage is completed before we enter into a contract to purchase or develop a site. A region commissions a suite of reports to facilitate the formulation of a plan to develop the site. The due diligence undertaken by the region to prepare a “Capital Expenditure 1” proposal includes: (i) _Land — legal reports and reports on title; (ii) _Technical — planning reports, geo-technical (ground) reports, surveys (topographical and environments) and design (architectural and engineering working); (iii) _Sales — market research reports; (iv) _Commercial — cost estimates and validation; and (v) _Construction — health and safety assessments, environmental assessments and programs to facilitate the accurate appraisal of a site. The focus is on identifying the key constraints (including sustainability constrains), risks and mitigation plans for the site, embedding them into the site appraisal and ensuring it still delivers in line with the threshold returns expected for gross margin and ROCE. The costs incurred as part of this stage include the design work by the architects and engineers, geotechnical work, surveys, solicitors fees and other consultants fees. The regional team presents this proposal to our Capex Committee, which comprises our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Group Production Director and Group Development Director, and which is supported by our legal team. Our Capex Committee reviews the scheme’s risk profile against the anticipated returns and cohesion of the regions plan while assessing the site for approval to proceed to exchange of contract. Approval is also required from the relevant Divisional Chairman and the Divisional Finance Director. Once Stage 2 approval is obtained, our legal team authorizes our panel solicitors to exchange contracts to purchase or develop a site. - _Stage 3 — “Capital Expenditure 2” Proposal: This stage is completed before we commence construction of the site. It reflects the completion of our pre-development due-diligence process, presenting the region’s final proposal to deliver the site, including the financial returns the region is committing to deliver (gross margin and ROCE). It reviews the final position on the land contract conditions, other legal matters, final details of the deal, technical constraints, latent risk and mitigation plan, breakdown of the site start budget build cost, a construction plan, a sales plan confirming values and volume (with updated independent market research) and the final profit output and cash requirements of the proposal. At this stage, planning consent has been granted and most, if not all, of the technical approvals have been obtained. Additionally, we will have already tendered the construction work, providing more cost certainty prior to commencing the development of the site . The regional team present this proposal to our Capex Committee for approval, along with approval from the Divisional Chairman and Divisional Finance Director. ----- Each region within the Group has land, technical, commercial, construction and sales functions to undertake (directly or through consultants) all of the pre-development due-diligence when assessing a site for acquisition. The technical function has overall responsibility for the ground, design, planning, utilities and environmental investigations. The nature, scale and assessed risk of a scheme and land deal, will determine the extent of the investigation undertaken, The work undertaken by consultants in high-risk areas, including geotechnical and groundworks areas, is peer-reviewed by other panel consultants to ensure we have identified the extent of any risk and to ensure that we have robust mitigation plans to protect our financial returns. Examples of the due diligence work that we undertake during our land acquisition approval process include: - full schedule of technical fees to undertake land due diligence; - planning consultation with Local Authorities and planning consultants to establish policy and requirements; - establishing site boundaries and legal ownership; - topography of the site; - conducting site access checks with the land registry and highways authority; - establishing the full requirements to develop the site, including remediation, foundation types, roads and sewers design and drainage connections and requirements; - conducting a full utilities trace which includes gas, water, electrical and communications equipment using ground penetrating radar; and - conducting engineering appraisals such as current drains and site requirements. The technical planning process is detailed and aimed at avoiding and minimizing risk when construction teams are on site. Following technical due diligence, the scheme will be packaged, tendered and costed for submission as described with respect to Stage 3 as described above. _Agreement of Development Framework and Objectives_ With respect to our partnership developments, after being selected as preferred developer we begin to negotiate with our partner an agreement laying out the basic framework of our relationship in each development. Typically, the framework agreement outlines terms applicable for the drawdown of land (sometimes on a phased basis), funding sources, the development timeframe, development milestones, permissible types of development, land price, land payment timing and the overage share, where applicable. We will then refine the objectives of our development with our partners. With Local Authorities, this usually entails neighborhood transformation through mixed-tenure housing construction and sometimes other community facilities. We are able to offer our partners a wide range of housing designs to suit their different needs and can tailor our developments to meet specific goals, such as space standards, tenure, sustainability and affordability. _Project Execution_ Land Acquisition and Construction The ways in which we secure development opportunities may require us to acquire the land being developed (sometimes in phases), or otherwise we may be granted with development rights while the original land owner retains ownership of the site and ultimately transfers completed units directly to the home purchaser. Our developments predominantly utilize the partnership model, although we from time to time acquire land in speculative deals where we believe that we can achieve attractive financial returns by developing the land on our own. These private developments may sometimes shift to partnership arrangements during the course of development, for example, by entering into an agreement with a Registered Provider during the course of development rather than at the outset. ----- Our North West MCI region has a different, but complementary operating model to our other regions. The North West MCI region, which became a part of our business following our acquisition of MCI in 2017, works exclusively with Registered Providers. The North West MCI region sources land in much the same way as our other regions, but agrees to deals whereby a Registered Provider buys the site and also pays us to build homes on the site through build contracts. The Registered Providers pay in advance for the land and progressively for the construction of the homes, resulting in a model with minimal working capital requirements and substantially removing the land and sales risk. Our other regions may also enter into similar arrangements with Registered Providers to deliver all homes on a site to that provider. This typically happens if we have a commercially attractive offer from the Registered Provider and can generate both a requisite gross margin and an attractive ROCE, with the Registered Provider funding both the land and build WIP. Once land is acquired or secured for development, we commence construction, with a focus on realistic build programs, product and process standardization and a focus on quality at each stage of the build. Standardized designs allow us to achieve design and building efficiencies while helping to maintain quality control and simplifying compliance with relevant building requirements. We seek to leverage our scale and procurement capabilities to deliver homes reliably and manage costs appropriately, utilizing rigorous “cost to complete” meetings to maintain control on costs throughout the process. Our construction team is responsible for the delivery of the build process on site to ensure it meets the required safety, quality and program requirements. Sites are appropriately resourced with experienced management teams to ensure the construction phase runs smoothly at each site. Infrastructure work is carefully programmed to optimize ROCE. Quality is a top priority for our business, and all supporting design detailing, workmanship and material specifications have been developed to embody good practice and simplification. These specifications, created in collaboration with all departments and subcontractor forums, are used at all stages of our design, procurement and subcontractor appointment processes. They are embedded in our quality training programs and site inductions and are also used as build quality checks. We have a formal inspection and sign off process that allows us to benchmark our build quality, consisting of an internal quality inspection process and external NHBC key stage inspections. Alongside this, we have produced a series of best practice guides for our site teams to ensure that our homes meet the required standard and comply with our detailed trade specifications. Customer satisfaction is supported by our inspection process, which drives our culture of keeping customers as the key focus of our business. Sustainability is also one of our key focus areas in terms of our approach to construction. Our sustainable construction practices include the utilization of timber-frame construction (accounting for 12% of homes completed in each of the financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020), the integration of digital and standardized designs which increase our ability to use offsite manufactured components, improved site efficiency, control of waste, and a modular homes partnership with ilke Homes. See “—Environment and Sustainability” below for further detail. Our core house type range is designed using Building Information Modelling (“BIM”). BIM is used to create house types using digital 3D models which facilitate simpler design, scheduling, cost estimating, programming, construction, sales visualizations, and sharing with partners and consultants (such as architects, engineers, community groups and planners). Certain house types designed and built using BIM further support improved efficiency, waste reduction and collaboration with our third-party designers. Our core house types accounted for 85% of all homes that we delivered in the financial year ended October 31, 2020. Additionally, we have been at the forefront in the use of MMC. These methods, which we believe are particularly well suited for high-volume developments, range from whole homes being constructed with factorybuilt volumetric modules to the use of componentized elements in the construction process. In Scotland, timber frames are used exclusively, whereas at other of our sites, they are used selectively where required in the bid brief. Furthermore, we look to integrate off-site manufactured components, such as roof and floor cassettes, which minimize waste and on-site processes within a traditional build. We have a strong understanding of MMC and make use of this in testing new technology and exploring and responding to demand for MMC-built homes on our sites. Standardization We focus on building homes from our standard house type range, with over 75% of our homes completed in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 being standard types. Standardization, and in particular a “Standard House Type Range” contribute to design and building efficiencies and quality control, as well as simplifying compliance with relevant building requirements. We utilize a clearly defined standard house type range that enables our business to benefit from standardization while facilitating flexibility to adapt both internal levels of specification and external elevations. ----- We apply standardized elevation and specification detailing in order to adapt to local planning design guides and regional market expectations. Standardization leads to less risk and greater cost predictability, while different exterior designs provide us with the flexibility to adapt to the local vernacular. The following charts shows the percentage of homes built by us that have used standardized designs during each of the years indicated below: We utilize a number of core standard design types as set out below: - _Open Market Sale Homes: these homes are designed to meet the needs of open market sales customers, and are focused on keeping homes affordable while optimizing land use and profitability. This is the default setting when planning a site, unless partners specify different, larger space standards. - _Design Quality Standards Homes (“DQS”): this is a house type of range aligned to an older design code, still preferred by some Registered Providers, which is larger than the “Open Market Sale Homes” range. These homes are designed for social rent at full occupancy. Homes built in accordance with these standards adhere to enhanced space standards for circulation, internal storage and specific minimum furniture layouts. - _Nationally Designed Space Standards Homes (“NDSS”): this is a house type range aligned to the Nationally Described Space Standards, representing a larger internal space standard, which is available for adoption by Local Authorities. NDSS homes are subject to local plan viability testing and approval by the planning inspectorate. These homes are deemed suitable across all tenures defined by the level of occupancy and were introduced to supersede DQS. - _Mobility Standards Homes: this house type range meets a higher level of accessibility and incorporates adaptability to address future mobility requirements for occupants. These homes typically include wider doors, enlarged circulation spaces and ground floor washrooms which are sized and serviced for future conversion into a ground floor shower room. - _Scottish Homes: these homes are developed to meet the Scottish building regulation and space standards. Our use of standardization provides us with a number of benefits, including the following: - increased efficiency resulting in reduced pre-development time scales and professional fees; - improved cost certainty, construction program certainty and accuracy of land feasibility analysis; - standard details promoting best practices for quality, safety and precise material scheduling, which in turn reduces waste; - standard finishes specification enabling forward demand planning, purchase leveraging and rebate maximization; - improved quality resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction and a reduction in aftercare costs; ----- - strong brand creation and the sharing of marketing assets between sites and regions; - repeat delivery supporting the efficiencies of our supply chain from tender to completion; and - streamlined incorporation of new regulatory standards and considerations into future project designs. Our approach to standardization is developed based on internal feedback for saleability and buildability, customer feedback, commercial viability, and land optimization. Furthermore, trade specifications have been developed to support the delivery of our homes to promote quality and safety in build and occupation. Design and Place-Making We have a proven track record of revitalizing communities through the delivery of high-quality, affordable homes, in well-designed and well-connected neighborhoods and we believe that our focus on design quality and place-making helps drive our success in planning applications and sales performance. We actively contribute to the NHBC Standard Review Group and other industry working groups to help ensure our design, detailing and specification represent best practices and are aligned to future change. Fundamental to our design principals is the creation of a sense of inclusion and community through the delivery of new homes of mixed tenures in attractive, regenerative environments that complement existing local areas and promote health and well-being. We consider the unique characteristics of each site and its surroundings and seek to incorporate and enhance existing natural landscape features and habitat to create a sense of place. Design guides support the use of the house types and elevational styles in delivering the principles of good place making. For example, strong street scenes, gateway access blocks, urban squares, overlooked public realm and vista stoppers can all be efficiently achieved using the standard range of houses. Our design model ultimately creates an attractive living space while maximizing development density. Pursuant to our partnership model, we engage with Local Authorities and other partners at an early stage to create design schemes that are acceptable to our local community and help to shape the social and community infrastructure provided in the area. Early planning and clear design and construction briefs for a regeneration site are particularly important to set a distinctive sense of place and the tone for the partnership with the local community. We also engage with communities at early stage regarding regeneration schemes to engender local support in both a political sense and from the community directly. We believe that our reputation for design and related collaborative working relationships with regeneration stakeholders are important factors that land owners and their advisers consider when considering us as a development partner. We strive to innovate and develop our designs to suit the requirements of all of our customers, including first-time buyers, families, social housing partners, supported housing providers, and the elderly. Our designs include enhanced mobility standards, where required, to support the needs of both able-bodied and disabled people. In certain situations, the design of new homes has been adapted to include special features to support the customer in their daily routine, for example including a lift, a bathroom with a lifting hoist and wider doors to allow for a wheelchair user to be able to easily access all areas of the home and garden. While tailoring designs in order to meet the needs of the customers is a focus of ours, we are also committed to ensuring the homes that we design are commercially optimized with respect to house type profitability, plot profitability and development density. The house type range that we’ve established creates a balanced mix of designs to foster generational and social diversity, support good place making and deliver plotting efficiency. We recognize the key role that commercial and other non-residential buildings and amenities (including neighborhood centers, retail space and schools) contribute to creating vibrant communities. Although our core business does not involve the development of these buildings and amenities, these are typically developed or delivered by third parties, and many of our brownfield developments are anchored around existing commercial and non-residential buildings and amenities. We are committed to building stable, sustainable, diverse and balanced communities, which have at their core an integration of public space, landscaping, biodiversity and sustainable drainage systems. Procurement and Supply We widely employ sub-contractors to build our homes, both for the purposes of efficiency and as part of our commitment to supporting local communities. Because of the fragmented nature of the market in which subcontracting firms operate, we typically work with local small-and medium-sized enterprises instead of national ----- companies. Prior to appointing sub-contractors, we pre-qualify them in line with the PAS 91 standardized questionnaire, through the use of a third party assessment provider. Each sub-contractor is assessed across a range of areas covering, among other items, health and safety, insurances, environmental, quality management, antibribery and corruption, financial standing, modern slavery and equal opportunities. Sub-contractors submit tenders based on the house type and design specifications, at which point we then compare the tender quotes against the appraisal and standard regional costs. Sub-contractors operate under our Keepmoat brand and our health and safety (“H&S”) team provides them with advice and support and monitors compliance with regulatory and best practice standards. We work continuously with sub-contractors to ensure a high-quality of product is delivered at a competitive cost base. We employ a diversified range of sub-contractors, which limits our exposure to individual sub-contractor risk and provides more downside protection and flexibility than a direct labor force. The construction and delivery of homes involves a substantial supply chain. We operate an advanced centralized procurement process to minimize lead time and construction delay, obtain quota guarantees and negotiate fair payment terms. Our materials supply-chain strategy is typically underpinned by annual, Group-wide deals with suppliers with a national, regional or local coverage. This enables us to negotiate better commercial terms through our consolidated volume and enables the utilization of volume-related rebates. We procure all material components centrally and have no sole supply agreements on any key materials. Our supply strategy is delivered through our supply chain director, who is supported by experienced commercial teams employed by us to manage our material supply chain and sub-contractor relationships. Our subcontractors are responsible for providing and installing a proportion of the materials required to build a house. Our suppliers play an essential role in our business, providing the materials and services that we use to build homes. Our business requires substantial amounts of construction materials, including bricks and blocks, in addition to construction and equipment and waste disposal services. We believe that maintaining a high-quality supplier base that is fully aligned to our values is critical to support our growth. Consequently, we seek to maintain a close partner-based relationship with local supply chains. This approach encourages face-to-face engagement with our suppliers to maintain core standards and to continuously improve quality, safety, service, innovation and cost competitiveness. We operate a series of group-wide, long-term strategic frameworks providing preferential commercial terms and service levels at a national and regional level to supply the requisite services, materials, site equipment and business consumables. These frameworks capture both direct purchases of supplies by us and indirect purchases of supplies, which we specify for use, by our contractors, offering significant pricing advantages, while also including important delivery, service and product warranties which helps us maintain and improve our quality and service to our customers. Our “Supply Chain Team” manages over 97 arrangements, which include framework agreements, commercial arrangements and formal price lists. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 88% of our direct spend was channeled through these frameworks. Our supply frameworks align with the Keepmoat Homes Standard Specification and opportunities to work closely with suppliers to assess new products and technologies to support our drive for standardization (for example, using roof and floor cassettes to simplify, speed up, make safer aspects of construction, while reducing the amount of waste). Our supply frameworks also provide customer care and product warranty support to our customer services teams, with many providing value engineering support, free site surveys and scheduling and pricing services. Additionally, our supply frameworks reduce business risk and help ensure a secure supply of our essential materials. We work hard to mitigate price increases and to ensure that our agreements are always competitive and provide the best quality without compromising on standards. Many of our framework agreements include rebate agreements. We maintain regular contact with suppliers and manufacturers to ensure continuity of supply, and negotiate our product allocations by volume. The availability of materials is secured in line with demand and we carefully manage the supply of our key products, including bricks and plasterboard, by working with our regional businesses and our supply chain partners. We engage with our suppliers to keep them informed of key forecasting information, providing them with a rolling build program on a monthly basis, in addition to product specific demand schedules. We also notify our supply chain of any changes to our working practices as appropriate. Our top-10 direct materials suppliers, based on expenditure in the financial year ended October 31, 2020, were as follows: -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

These teams collaborate with our partners and local communities throughout a development’s lifecycle, from inception to viability assessment, planning applications and infrastructure planning and then construction and completion. Our central marketing team is responsible for branding, corporate literature, digital support and public relations. It also operates our social media platforms, produces sales and marketing literature, promotes our developments and works towards strengthening our brand identity. As of July 31, 2020, we had two employees in our central marketing team. We utilize a number of typical marketing strategies, including the following: - targeted social media advertising aimed at our core market demographics, using Facebook and Instagram, focusing on key locations identified in our market research; - advertising in suitable local and professional publications, aimed at our core market; - local advertising on bus routes and using digital platforms at stations near sites; - development and house type brochures available in our onsite marketing suites; - informative brochures and advertising explaining the “Shared Equity” and Help to Buy schemes, available in our marketing suite and through online and postal mail shots, as well as print, online and social media; - first-time buyer clinic events; - first-time buyer and drop-in sessions arranged with large local employers and held at their premises and coupled with potential incentives for employees of these organizations; and - an “Easymove” facility to help customers with the sales process of their existing home. Our regional sales teams operate out of our sales outlets, of which we had 56 outlets operating as of July 31, 2021. Regional sales teams are overseen by sales managers, who maintain a detailed understanding of the local real estate market and trends. Members of our sales teams are generally present at our active sales outlets and guide buyers through the home buying process. Our sales outlets are typically open five days per week, with sites in certain high demand areas being open seven days per week. We directly recruit, employ and train our sales ----- executives to deliver their sales services to our specific target customer demographics. As of July 31, 2021, we had 145 employees in our regional sales teams. Our sales teams are supported by our digital sales capabilities, which have taken on increased importance in recent years. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, we opened eight digital sales offices. We also secured 1,254 online reservations through our digital sales offices and our “Reserve Online” tool in the same financial year, which was equivalent to approximately 50% of our completions in the period. The typical process and timeframe for a house sale is as follows: - _Site visits (week 0): at this stage, the customer typically undertakes multiple visits to the site to review the development and the available housing choices; - _Preliminary credit assessment (weeks 1-4): at this stage, the customer has narrowed down his or her interest. Our sales team refers the customer to an independent financial advisor to make a preliminary credit assessment and evaluate mortgage eligibility; - _Reservation (week 4): the customer reserves the property and pays a nominal fee; - _Exchange contracts (weeks 12-14): at this stage, the customer typically instructs a solicitor to undertake the conveyancing work, progresses the mortgage application and enters into a contract for the purchase; and - _Legal completion (week 24-26): the customer completes the purchase and moves in, after the house is built and inspected for quality. We pursue a sales strategy that blends the potential for margin enhancement through open-market sales with the certainty, risk mitigation and cash generation of selling to Registered Providers. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 74% of our sales were on the open market (which includes sales to private customers as well as elective sales to Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a site) and 26% to Registered Providers as part of the Section 106 affordable housing obligations agreed in connection with the planning consents required for our sites or as otherwise agreed with Registered Providers at the outset of development. In comparison, in the financial year ended October 31, 2019, we sold 78% of our plots in the open market and 22% to Registered Providers. Open market sales are delivered primarily through our sales team, who are present at each site. We typically design a sales area, including a sales office and show homes, to present a shop-window of how the site will look once developed. We look to open these sales areas as early as possible in the development of our sites to allow customers to experience what they may eventually purchase. Conversely, sales to Registered Providers are agreed at the time of the planning process, pursuant to our Section 106 obligations, in accordance with an authority’s affordable-housing policy. Through our strong relationship with national and local Registered Providers we are able to agree commercially-driven elective sales to Registered Providers subsequent to the initial planning stage, which serves an important tool in maintaining sales flexibility throughout the life of the site. These sales are often only at a small discount to open market prices as they benefit from grants or other funding (such as Affordable Homes Programme funding). Although a relatively small proportion of our business, we treat private rental sector (“PRS”) sales as complementary to our open-market and Registered Provider sales. PRS sales are location sensitive as they only work on commercially acceptable terms in areas with strong rental demand and rental values. We discuss PRS sales with our partners and seek to devise sales strategies on a site-by-site basis. We completed sales for a total of 2,774 homes, 2,460 homes and 4,035 homes in the nine months ended July 31, 2021, the financial year ended October 31, 2020 and the financial year ended October 31, 2019, respectively. As of July 31, 2021, our forward order book, which represents (i) plots that are contracted for but homes have yet to be completed on the lot and (ii) plot reservations for which contracts have yet to be exchanged, was approximately £503.2 million, comprising of 3,151 plots. As of September 19, 2021, we had reserved, exchanged or legally completed almost all of our planned sales for the financial year ending October 31, 2021. Furthermore, as of September 19, 2021, we had secured ----- approximately 40% of our planned sales for the year ended October 31, 2022, 85% of our planned sales for the three months ended January 31, 2022 and 45% of our planned sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022..",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

The customer may cancel at any time before the exchange of contracts, and if they have purchased through the Help to Buy scheme and have cancelled within ten calendar days of the reservation, they will be entitled to a full refund of their reservation fee. Otherwise, the customer will be refunded the reservation fee less administrative costs of £125. Once contracts have been exchanged, the customer may only serve notice to cancel the sale if (i) we have not served the completion notice (confirming the date on which completion will take place) before the long stop date specified in the sale contract; or (ii) we have made substantial changes to the property that were not agreed in advance by the customer. If the purchaser does not serve notice to cancel where the property is not ready and the completion notice has not been served by the relevant long stop date, then we may continue to build the property, concluding as soon as reasonably practicable, and the customer must complete the purchase. If the customer fails to complete the purchase on the completion date (once such date has been set), we may provide ten days’ notice to complete the purchase, following which we will have the right to rescind the contract if the customer still fails to complete the purchase. If we are to exercise our right of rescission, we may retain the deposit and any accrued interest, claim damages if applicable and re-sell the property.

First-time buyers are one of our key demographics, representing 76% of our private sales in the financial year ended October 31, 2020. First-time buyers with the benefit of financial support schemes from the Government have historically proven to provide resilient structural demand and constitute a deep and relatively predictable market. First-time buyers are typically “need to buy” customers, in that they are experiencing life events such as moving out from parental homes or getting married. We serve a young and diverse customer group, with 73% of private sale customers aged 35 or younger (based on statistics from a survey of 1,053 customers in the financial year ended October 31, 2020). We generally do not have large exposure to customers in any particular occupation, implying a well-diversified customer economic exposure. In terms of the way that our customers finance their purchases, based on statistics from the same survey in the financial year ended October 31, 2020, approximately 68% of our private sale customers utilized the Help to Buy scheme, 30% were unassisted and 1% utilized the Affordable Homes Programme.

We review our processes on an ongoing basis and continually strive to introduce further improvements to allow us to deliver greater levels of customer service. We include all regional management teams in this process to ensure improvements are delivered consistently across the entire business. Our bespoke quality inspection process has enabled us to deliver greater and more consistent levels of quality control in the homes that we build. We are continuing to develop our quality inspection process to introduce even more rigor to processes to make sure we continue to deliver high-quality homes for our customers. In addition to the changes to our quality inspection process, we have also developed a range of training programs for our people, which are regularly delivered to ensure that they understand the importance that we place on delighting our customers. We maintain close contact with our customers throughout their journey, from their initial enquiry, during the exciting process of purchasing their new homes and after they move in, to ensure they consistently receive a high level of service.

The HSS committee’s terms of reference include determination of our strategic objectives and improvement initiatives, H&S policy, performance monitoring, assurance (internal and external audit) and maintenance of ISO 9001, 14001 and 45001 certification. We received a Gold Award from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (“RoSPA”) in 2020. The criteria for the award included, among other items, accreditation to ISO standards, levels of compliance with guidelines for high-risk activities and objective H&S performance, including accident rates. The Gold Award is the achievement awarded by RoSPA and is awarded to companies that can demonstrate: - excellent occupational health and safety management systems evidenced by strong third party audit results and company culture demonstrated by answers to key performance questions; - a rigorous approach to occupational health; - high levels of compliance with control measures (evidenced by active monitoring of performance) for principal risks; - low/reducing rates of error, harm (accidents and work related ill health) and loss (e.g. accident and ill health costs); - no fatal or major injuries due to employer negligence; and - no significant enforcement issues such as notices and/or prosecutions. In line with Home Builders Federation reporting requirements, our annual injury incident rate in June 2021 was 205 per 100,000 employed.

We have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help ensure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws, including internal and external compliance audits, national quality assurance certification audits (both centrally and regionally), monthly inspection of all development sites by our H&S team and annual construction compliance audits of all sites by our H&S team. We also engage a third party expert adviser (Waterman EHS) to maintain an environmental legal register for us, identifying compliance requirements and assisting us in identifying and developing actions needed to comply with forthcoming environmental legislation. Our priority areas of focus are carbon & energy, waste & resource efficiency, remediation (with brownfield development being a core part of our business model), pollution & water and ecology & biodiversity. We regularly review our objectives for each of these areas, driving continual improvements across our business. We also provide regular environmental training for our staff. Our environmental management system is certified to ISO 14001:2015. In July 2020, following stakeholder consultation, we published our Sustainability Strategy in which we identified our material issues and aligned our strategy to eight United Nations SDGs. Through our Sustainability Strategy, we are committed to ----- minimizing our impact on the environment and biodiversity. Additionally, in working with Wildscapes, which is a wildlife trust consultancy, we are looking to develop methodologies to support the delivery of a net gain in biodiversity for future developments. The protection of ecological features is essential to our business, as is the inclusion of sustainable drainage solutions and green infrastructure strategies, supported by ecological assessments, to enhance and future proof the sustainability and attractiveness of our developments. We also strive to address the future impacts of climate change such as extreme weather events and overheating. Another key component of our sustainability drive is the employment of advanced techniques and the minimization of our environmental impact in our design and build processes. For instance, we have recently been focusing on timber-frame construction, which, in addition to having a faster return on capital outlay, is also a sustainable form of construction. We were an early adopter of sustainable building information modelling to maximize development efficiency and align design to off-site manufacture and on-site assembly techniques. Additional actions and practices that we have employed include the use of standardized designs to improve site efficiency and control waste, modular homes provided by ilke Homes aimed at contributing toward a high-quality, low-carbon and precision-engineered housing solution and participation in Gorton low carbon homes trials. Approximately 96% of our construction waste was diverted from landfills in the financial year ended October 31, 2020. Since May 2021, we have transitioned to 100% of electricity from renewable sources. Our portfolio has been developed to meet the needs of our partners in the delivery of enhanced NDSS space standards and mobility standards for a mix of tenure. Furthermore, given that digital technology is considered to be one of the strands to achieving a healthier life and an essential element for enabling the flexibility for home working, future developments will benefit from broadband fiber connectivity with speeds of one gigabit.

To lead our team in this period of significant transformation, we recently appointed Myles Gibbins to the role of IT & Digital Director. Myles brings over 20 years’ experience in the home building industry and possess exceptional knowledge and experience of delivering similar business transformation projects. Over the past several years, we have invested significantly in digital technologies in order to re-engineer the customer journey and make the process of buying a new home easier and more closely aligned to the expectations of our young customer demographic. This investment ensured that we were able to sell homes through our reserve online tool while brick-and-mortar sales offices were closed during COVID-19 related lockdown periods. Recent enhancements to our digital technologies include a new appointment booking system, an online “House Configurator” to allow new customers to add options and upgrade their new homes and an online payment tool to enable all payments to be made through our website. In particular, the addition of the booking tool has resulted in additional benefits to our business, including improved visibility on footfall to sites, ----- which has in turn enabled us to optimize our staffing levels accordingly. Further enhancements are now in development, including additional features such as identity checks and anti-money laundering checks. We make use of Business Intelligence and Dashboards to support our internal monitoring and reporting and strategic decision making. Additionally, our core desktop and server infrastructure has been aligned such that each relies on Microsoft, and in particular, Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure. The alignment of these systems promotes certain efficiencies and allows for the quick restoration of data and services in the event of any disruption.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Company and to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor): (i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary or desirable; (ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor (and any claim of a Debtor arising as part of any Cash Management Services) over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors; (iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets and (C) any other claim of an intra- group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor (and any claim of a Debtor arising as part of any Cash Management Services) over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors; (iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors: (A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Creditor ----- or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other liabilities, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors; (v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to: (A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities (and liabilities owed to a Debtor as part of any Cash Management Services) or liabilities to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and (B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent has no obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price). If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Enhanced Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release. If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Enhanced Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give, and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release. Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities, ----- guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Company, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Company and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities. If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities and Transaction Security securing Second Lien Liabilities and/or Topco Liabilities will be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release that either: (i) the Second Lien Agent, Second Lien Notes Trustee (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), Topco Agent and Topco Notes Trustee (as applicable) have approved the release;

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it ----- will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of £100,000 in principal amount, and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.” Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of £100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes: (1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes; (2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part; (3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or (4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

No Escrow Account will be established on the Issue Date to the extent the Acquisition is anticipated to complete on or shortly after the Issue Date. The Escrow Account, if established, will be segregated from the Issuer’s other funds. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. Any initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account in connection with the Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement such as ordinary course charges and fees paid to the bank holding the Escrow Account) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” Interest will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes. See “Risk Factors—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuer _will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account will not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without relying on an additional equity investment from the shareholders.”_ To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of the Notes, the Issuer will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, subject to certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account and the Issuers’ rights under the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to one or more escrow account charges dated the Issue Date between the Issuer, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Charges”); provided, however, that such liens and security interest shall ----- automatically be released and terminate upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined below). The Escrow Charges will provide that the funds will be segregated and held for the purposes specified herein. By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as directed by the Issuer in such short-term liquid investments (including bank deposit products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments, as the Issuer will from time to time direct in writing. To the extent needed, the Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account, upon instruction of the Company or the Issuer, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or the most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the Escrow Release in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the Notes under the Indenture as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In addition, the Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property in respect of negative interest having accrued on the Escrowed Property. Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in the previous paragraph, the Company and the Issuer will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company or the Issuer) (the “Escrow Release”) (the date of the Escrow Release being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee, on or prior to December 31, 2021 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), of an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”), upon which the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further investigation, certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the “Escrow Conditions”) will be met substantially concurrently with or promptly following (that is, within three Business Days) the Release on the Escrow Release Date: (1) on or prior to the Completion Date, the Equity Contribution necessary to complete the Acquisition will have been made; (2) the Acquisition will be consummated promptly (that is, within three Business Days) following release of the Escrowed Property, on the terms as described in the Offering Memorandum under the section “Summary—The Transactions,” except for any changes or other modifications or waivers to such terms that will not (when taken as a whole) have a material adverse effect on the Holders; (3) immediately after consummation of the Acquisition, the Company will own, directly or indirectly, 100.0% of the share capital of the Target; and (4) at the time the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate is delivered, there shall not be an Event of Default with respect to the Company or the Issuer under Clause (5) of the definition of Events of Default. Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the Escrow Accounts will be reduced to zero. In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent and the Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (the date of any such event being the “Special",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Written notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company no later than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agents, and will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is given by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest or Additional Amounts owing to Holders of the Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes and, if the Escrow Accounts alone do not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption and, as such, the Issuer will be required to obtain the necessary funds elsewhere, such as equity investment from shareholders. The Company or the Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which in each case must be an Initial Purchaser or one or more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being deemed a Release; _provided that the Company and the Issuer provide a substantially equivalent security interest to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security interest was initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; and provided further that use of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Company or the Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account. Any such new Escrow Account will be segregated from the Issuer’s other funds, and shall be controlled by the Escrow Agent, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption.

However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Issuer) as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

The Proceeds Loan will be denominated in pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes. The Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a rate at least equal to the interest rates of the Notes. Interest on the Proceeds Loan will be payable quarterly in arrear in respect of the Notes on or prior to the corresponding date for the payment of interest on such Notes. The Proceeds Loan Agreement will provide that the Company will pay the Issuer interest and principal due and payable on the Notes and any Additional Amounts due thereunder. All amounts payable under the Proceeds Loan will be payable to such account or accounts with such Person or Persons as the Issuer may designate. The maturity date of the Proceeds Loan will be the same as the maturity date of the Notes. Except as ----- otherwise required by law, all payments under the Proceeds Loan Agreement will be made without deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that the Company is required to make any such deduction or withholding, such entity shall gross-up each payment to the Issuer to ensure that the Issuer receives and retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. The Proceeds Loan will provide that the Company will make all payments pursuant thereto on a timely basis in order to ensure that the Issuer can satisfy its payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture, taking into account the administrative and timing requirements under the Indenture with respect to amounts payable on the Notes. An assignment of the Issuer’s rights under, and receivables in respect of, the Proceeds Loan Agreement will be granted in favor of the Security Agent as part of the Collateral, as described below under “—Security— _General.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.8,Notes Guarantees,21.8.1,General,"On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 150 days from the Completion Date and substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior basis by Keepmoat Limited, Keepmoat Homes Limited and M.C.I. Developments Limited (the “Post-Closing Guarantors”). The Guarantors also guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain guarantee limitations as set out therein. In addition, as described below “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility in the future or certain Credit Facilities or Public Debt, in each case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time or cost of granting the Notes Guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes _Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” For further information on the_ Agreed Security Principles, see “—Security—General.” Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and other similar laws, rules and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our _Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.” The validity_ and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described under “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests _and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, winding up or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Company for application under the Proceeds Loan. As of and for the quarter ended July 31, 2021, the Guarantors ----- (including the Post-Closing Guarantors) accounted for 99% of total assets, 100% of revenue and 99% of Adjusted EBITDA of KM Group on a consolidated basis. The Issuer is a finance subsidiary formed solely for the purposes of issuing the Notes and as of the Completion Date its only material assets will be its rights and claims under the Proceeds Loan. As such, the Issuer will be dependent on the Company to make payments on the Proceeds Loan for cash to service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes. In turn, the Company is a holding company with its material assets being the Capital Stock of the Target, which in turn is a holding company. As such, the Company will be dependent upon its indirect Subsidiaries for cash to service interest, principal and other payments on the Proceeds Loan. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Company or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation, winding up or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that nonguarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer, the Company or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer, the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer, the Company or such Guarantor. Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture.

Each of the releases set forth above will be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

The Liens on the Collateral to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are referred to herein collectively as the “Security Interest.” Any other property or assets over which Security Interest may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with general statutory limitations, capital maintenance rules, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and other similar laws, rules and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The_ grant and control of the security will also be subject to certain Agreed Security Principles. The following is a nonexhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which provide that Collateral shall not be created or perfected to the extent that it would: - result in any breach of general legal and statutory limitations, capital maintenance rules, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction (provided that the relevant grantor of security shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle); - result in a material risk to the officers of the relevant grantor of security of contravention of their fiduciary or statutory duties, any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction and/or of civil or criminal liability (provided that the relevant grantor of security shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle); - result in costs (including adverse effects on or with respect to taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable fees) that, in the opinion of the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company (both acting reasonably), are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that security; - relative to any assets subject a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint or to third party arrangements which prevent those assets from being charged or assigned (provided that this does not prejudice the relevant entity from using all reasonable endeavors to obtain consent to such charging or assignment), including without limitation any joint ventures or shares in joint ventures; - have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant obligor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the agreements to which it is a party; - result in security being given over any Development Assets unless and until any such Development Assets which otherwise are required to be subject to Transaction Security in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles have been unconditionally and irrevocably released from any applicable third party security, liabilities or other arrangements in connection with any development; - result in security being given by or over any acquired person or asset which are required to support acquired (or acquisition) indebtedness to the extent such acquired (or acquisition) indebtedness is permitted by the terms of the Indenture to remain outstanding after an acquisition; or ----- - result in security being given over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than in relation to security under general business conditions of bank accounts which do not prohibit or prevent the creation of Collateral over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document). The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by the Company. The Liens securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will also secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, and may secure other future Indebtedness Incurred after the Issue Date; _provided, however, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a distressed disposal of, or enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, the Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a superpriority basis have been repaid in full. In addition, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” each of the Security Providers, the Issuer and the Guarantors is permitted to charge the Collateral in connection with future Incurrences of Indebtedness, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition to the release provisions described below, the Security Interest will cease to exist by operation of law or will be released, depending on the type of security interest, upon the defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the enforcement or sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders, and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the _Notes and Our Structure—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.” In addition,_ the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to release the Security Interest, by reference to the interests of other creditors of the group. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to (a) public auctions or competitive sales process or (b) after obtaining a valuation and fairness opinion.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely, without further enquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer after this offering and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (6)). The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Person, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.16,Change of Control,21.16.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional _Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (equal to £100,000 or in integral multiples_ of £1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Notes of £100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. No later than 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the ----- security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than the later of (x) 60 days from the date such notice is delivered and (y) the date of completion of the Change of Control Triggering Event, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility that permits the lenders thereunder to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event; provided, however, that such Change of Control Offer is conditional upon such Change of Control if either (i) a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer for the Notes is made or (ii) a tender offer that the Issuer believes would more likely than not result in a Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. ----- The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include, in any manner that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this ----- covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(4) in the case of any refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing; (5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, deeds of indemnity to insurance companies, guarantee facilities or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, deeds of indemnity to insurance companies, guarantee facilities or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, deeds of indemnity to insurance companies, guarantee facilities or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing; and (10) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS. Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;_ _provided_ that the amount of any refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness, or the additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock, in respect of such Indebtedness and such increased amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary on such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred on such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any pounds sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Sterling Equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date or, with respect to the Target and its Subsidiaries, the Completion Date, shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date or the Completion Date, as applicable; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a currency agreement (with respect to sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being ----- refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent nor the Registrar is responsible for those operations or procedures.

They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. As Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

The Indenture will not incorporate or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, including Section 316(b) of such act. The gross proceeds of this offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be on-lent to the Company. In turn, the Company will use the proceeds, together with the Equity Contribution, to be used to: (i) fund the consideration payable for the Acquisition, (ii) repay existing indebtedness of the Target Group, (iii) repay transaction costs of the sellers, and (iv) pay related fees and expenses incurred. Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the Issuer will, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, but only to the extent the Acquisition will not complete on or shortly after the Issue Date, deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account (as defined below). In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined below) occurs and the Escrow Agent (as defined below) shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below).

Prior to the Completion Date, neither the Company nor the Issuer will control Keystone Topco Limited (the “Target”) or any of its Subsidiaries (together, the “Target Group”), and no member of the Target Group will be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Completion Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities on the Issue Date and any such non-compliance will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Completion Date. The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the priority of payment for amounts received by the Security Agent.

The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing US holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the US holder, and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received.

A US holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such US holder. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the US dollar value of the foreign currency ----- purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant US holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such US holder will determine the US dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If a US holder receives foreign currency on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the US dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such taxable disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis US holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis US holder, will determine the US dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis US holders in regards to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the US holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis US holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date. Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be US source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal to the difference, if any, between the US dollar value of the US holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the US holder disposes of the Note, and the US dollar value of the US holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the US holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such US holder on such disposition. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be US source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate US holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed with the US Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for US federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. However, if Additional Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period, have the same CUSIP or ISIN as the original Notes issued hereby, and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all the notes, including the Notes issued hereby, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on passthru payments on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security. Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge. On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of insolvency officeholders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency officeholders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its centre of main interests (“COMI”) in a member state of the European Union, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of any English Obligor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the United Kingdom or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the United Kingdom. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions. See “—Cross-border Recognition _of English Insolvency and Restructuring Proceedings.”_ English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by the Notes Guarantees and secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the payment obligations of the Issuer in respect of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer, of a Notes Guarantee against an English Obligor and of the security interests over the Collateral. ----- The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights for payment of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer, under the Notes Guarantees and/or under the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Obligor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the ----- amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below. See “—Priority on Insolvency.” Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, the debtor company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as described in “—Qualifying Floating Charge”) where the floating charge has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court. Different appointment procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business as an agent of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “—Prescribed Part”). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed such that no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Regulations. Accordingly, if any of the English Obligors were to enter into administration, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator while the relevant company was in administration.

The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into administration.

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement,” as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration”). The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointer. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointer). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Prescribed Part”).",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

An English Obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that ----- such creditors are given under the scheme.

While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties. A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed compromise, there is no requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting, and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of the plan, provided that the court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ and (b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes of this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors do not vote in favor of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes. Following approval of the restructuring plan at the meetings of creditors, the restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether each applicable statutory condition has been satisfied and consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies.

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the ----- company’s members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act – see “—Administration”). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the United Kingdom in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction (see “—Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of the English _Courts”), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England,_ Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary windingup – it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “—Avoidance _of Transactions”)._ In light of the coronavirus pandemic, legislation has been introduced which temporarily restricts the ability of creditors to present winding-up petitions and of courts to grant winding-up orders. While these measures remain in place, (a) winding-up petitions on the basis of a company’s inability to satisfy a statutory demands alone are void if the relevant statutory demands were served between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021, and (b) where winding-up petitions are presented between April 27, 2020 and September 30, 2021 based on other grounds, the petitioning creditor must show that it had reasonable grounds to believe that coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the company or that the company’s inability to pay its debts would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on the company. Between April 27, 2020 and September 30, 2021, a court may similarly only grant a winding-up order in circumstances where a company is deemed unable to pay its debts and it appears to the court that coronavirus has had a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition if the court is satisfied that the company’s insolvency would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on the company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. ----- Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness); - _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers as well as bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent such claims exceed the statutory limit. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - _Fifth ranking: `o` firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; `o` secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and `o` thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid; and ----- - _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the granting of the security and/or guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid. _Onset of Insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below). A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. ----- A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest or guarantee granted by the English Obligors include, without limitation, the following described below: _Transactions at an Undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) where the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the company’s insolvency is within a period of two years from the date the company grants the security interest or the guarantee. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see “—Connected Persons”), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose an obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preferences_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside payments, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) where such payment, creation of security interest or guarantee constituted a preference. A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into insolvency within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if a transaction has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. However, a court shall not make an order unless the company which entered into the transaction was influenced by a desire to produce a preferential position in relation to that person when taking their decision. ----- In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose an obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. _Transactions Defrauding Creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where a transaction was at an undervalue and the court is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction including the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and use of the provision is therefore not limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no statutory time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose an obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Voidable Floating Charges_ Under English insolvency law, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year prior to the onset of the company’s insolvency (or two years in the case of a floating charge in favor of a connected person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to; (b) the goods or services supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for a company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of granting the floating charge or to become insolvent as a consequence of doing so does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration. However, if the floating charge is created or otherwise arising under a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in “Administration” above. ----- _Recharacterization of Fixed Charges_ As referred to above (see “—Fixed Versus Floating Charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterized as a floating charge. If such recharacterization falls within the suspect period referred to above (see “—Voidable Floating Charges”), this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the Consideration. _Disclaimer_ An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to an executed contract nor can it, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. Any person suffering loss or damage in consequence of the operation of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and may prove for the loss or damage in the winding up.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion of the court. The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Among other requirements, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its entry into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial ----- benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable.” Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law. _Security Registration_ Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest (the “Registration Period”). While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the Registration Period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the Registration Period has expired. The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets. _Moratoriums_ As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “— _Administration”), moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “—Liquidation/Winding- up”). Restriction on the Operation and Exercise of Ipso Facto Provisions_ Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant officeholder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act).",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and the United Kingdom, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain UK insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the United Kingdom) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the United Kingdom) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the foreign jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in the UK of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations only provide for recognition of proceedings under British insolvency law, which in relation to England and Wales covers proceedings initiated under the Insolvency Act other than receivership proceedings and members’ voluntary liquidations, and does not extend to restructuring processes governed by corporate law such as schemes of arrangement and restructuring plan processes. The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 and the Lugano Convention 2007 (subject to the United Kingdom’s pending accession to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties. _Recognition in the European Union_ Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the European Union (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the United Kingdom and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the United Kingdom was a member state of the European Union. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may adversely affected as a result. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Subject to the terms set forth in the purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), the Issuer has agreed to sell, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase, the entire principal amount of the Notes offered hereby from the Issuer. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may change the prices at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates, who are qualified broker dealers under applicable law, including in respect of sales into the United States. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Company and its subsidiaries will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the US Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 60 days after the date the Notes are issued, to not, and to cause its subsidiaries to not, without having received the prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that have a tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes and the Notes Guarantees). The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.” In addition, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Investors.” Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; - has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Securities to any retail investor (within the meaning of Article 4(1) of MiFID II) in the European Economic Area; and - has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Securities to any retail investor (within the meaning of point (8) of Article 2 of the EUWA) in the United Kingdom. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer, its subsidiaries or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us, the Company and its subsidiaries or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum ----- nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.” The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time solicit offers for, or offer or sell, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the US Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List in accordance with the rules of the Authority; however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obliged, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the US Securities Act and the US Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure—There may _not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ The Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Stabilizing Manager to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes _and Our Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be      business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the US Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the US Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or on the next           successive business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may engage in brokerage activities, may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve ----- securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If one or more Initial Purchaser or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates, they may routinely hedge their credit exposure to us or our affiliates in a manner consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchaser and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are lenders under the Existing Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Term Facility, which will be repaid with the net proceeds of the Offering. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are acting as mandated arrangers, lenders and/or agents under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are acting as arrangers, lenders and/or agents under the committed bridge facility financing that we have entered into to provide financing for the Acquisition in the event the Offering is not consummated, and in connection therewith such entities will receive customary fees and commissions. Additionally, the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates have historically provided, and may in the future provide, certain investment and commercial banking services to us and our affiliates (including hedging, customary overdraft facilities, charge cards and hire purchase financings) and have performed, and may perform, other services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received, or may receive, customary advisory and transaction fees, commissions and expense reimbursement. Moreover, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are or may become parties to certain of our hedging arrangements, following the closing of the Offering. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

In order to enforce any such US judgment in England or Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England or Wales. In such an action, the court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the US court (subject to what is stated below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). However, an English or Welsh court may decline to enforce a US judgment where: - the US judgment was procured by fraud; - the US judgment was given contrary to the English rules of natural or substantial justice, for example the defendant was not given due notice of the original proceedings or was not given an adequate opportunity to be heard in the original proceedings, or the defendant did not have the opportunity to correct procedural irregularities under the laws of the court giving judgment; - recognition of the US judgment would be contrary to English public policy; - recognition of the US judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998; - the US judgment conflicts with an earlier English judgment, or foreign judgment that is enforceable in an English court; - the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration agreement or a contractual choice of court agreement or where recognition or enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to the terms of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982; - enforcement of the US judgment would involve the enforcement of foreign taxes, fines or penalties (which involves payment to the State as distinct from an individual) or revenue or other public law; - enforcement of the US judgment would contravene Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980, which precludes, among other things, the enforcement by any court in the United Kingdom of any judgment given by a court of an overseas country which is a judgment for multiple damages which exceed the compensatory element of the judgment award; or - enforcement of the US judgment is time-barred or outside any relevant limitation periods.

These risks are monitored and managed through robust policies and procedures. Liquidity risk relates to the Group generating sufficient cash flow to meet its operational requirements while avoiding debt covenant breaches or excessive debt levels. Total borrowings are a combination of long-term loans and long term committed revolving working capital credit facilities. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group continually monitors open market house sales volumes and prices; working capital levels and contract profitability; and both client and supplier credit references and credit terms with clients and suppliers to ensure they continue to be appropriate. Credit risk is in relation to trade receivables from customers. Given that the majority of trade receivables are with public and regulated organisations, the exposure to credit risk is very limited. Interest rate risk relates to the impact of interest rate increases on the Group’s floating rate borrowings. The Group’s term loan, revolving credit and overdraft facilities are all on floating rates. Whilst the risk of an increase in interest rate is beyond the Group’s control, management continually keeps this exposure under review. Price risk relates to costs increasing beyond budget due to the reduced availability of skilled labour or shortages of building materials at competitive prices. The Group works hard to mitigate price increases and ensures that agreements are always competitive and provide the best quality without compromising on standards. In the course of its ordinary activities, the Group is exposed to financial risks which include liquidity, credit and interest rate risks.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1829,INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1829.29,Going concern,1829.29.1,,"The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval, having reassessed the principal risks facing the Group and determined that there are no material uncertainties to disclose. In making their assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, the Directors have considered the projected performance of the Group, and both the financial resources currently in place and also those financial resources that are committed and will be available to the 10 ----- #### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 30 October 2020 Group following the completion of the acquisition of Keystone Topco Limited, the 100% immediate parent of the Group by funds controlled by Aermont Capital LLP (“Aermont”) (“the Aermont Acquisition”). The assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern has been made both on the basis that the Aermont Acquisition of the Group is completed (which at the date of this assessment is unconditional under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement dated 4 August 2021 (“SPA”) following satisfaction of all the conditions to the SAP on 20th September 2021) and also on the basis that the Aermont Acquisition does not complete. At 31 July 2021 the Group held cash and cash equivalents of £45.2m and total loans and borrowings of £175.0m, which consisted of £7.3m of overdraft, bank and other loans of £10.2m and £157.5m of term loan facility that matures in December 2024. Should further funding be required, the Group has a committed £75m RCF (of which an overdraft of £7.3m was utilised at 31 July 2021), subject to compliance with certain financial covenants, of which £15.0m matures in December 2021 and £60.0m matures in June 2024. At the date of the assessment, the financial resources that are committed and will be available to the Group on completion of the Aermont Acquisition total £345m, comprising £275.0m of senior term facilities with a six-year maturity and £70.0m of committed revolving credit facilities (‘RCF) which have a maturity of five and half years. At completion, £70.0m of the committed RCF will be undrawn. It is Aermont’s intention that the £275.0m of debt facilities required for the Aermont Acquisition is provided through the proposed issue of senior secured notes by Maison Finco Plc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Maison Bidco Limited, on The International Stock Exchange. The Offering Memorandum for the proposed issuance of the senior secured notes has been issued on the date that the condensed consolidated interim financial report for the nine-month reporting period ended 31 July 2021 was approved by the Directors. As such, in consideration of its net current assets of £334.4m at 31 July 2021, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its current liabilities and working capital requirements. The performance of the Group is dependent upon a number of external factors and the wider macro-economic environment in which it operates. The material factors that may affect the future financial performance of the Group include flat or negative economic growth, buyer confidence, mortgage availability and affordability, new housing supply, falls in house prices or land values and the cost and availability of materials, subcontractors and suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to an increase in the inherent uncertainty in the Group’s assessment of these factors. Since the restart of construction and sales activity in May/June 2020 following the closure of sites in the first national lockdown, the UK housing market and the Group’s level of sales reservations has shown a strong and continued recovery. Demand relative to supply remains strong and the business has successfully managed construction activity and new site openings to align delivery accordingly. During the second national lockdown from November 2020 to January 2021 and throughout the calendar year of 2021 to date the business traded without significant interruption. However, the outlook remains unclear: whilst unemployment is low and not expected to rise significantly when the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme ends in Autumn 2021, inflationary pressures from higher energy costs and supply chain issues may impact the wider macro-economic environment. Future tightening of restrictions in response to new variant outbreaks of COVID-19 and consequential local or national restrictions may cause further disruption to the Group’s operations. The Directors’ assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern includes consideration of cash flow forecasts for the Group and the current borrowing and debt facilities available to the Group and those facilities that are committed and will be available to the Group following the completion of the Aermont Acquisition. To assess the Group’s resilience to adverse trading conditions, its financial forecast has been sensitised through a series of scenarios reflecting the principal downside risks for the UK economy and housing market. The scenarios reflect potential downside risks as presented in the latest available external economic forecasts. This exercise included an aggregated reasonable worst-case scenario reflecting a manifestation of the principal risks to a severe but plausible level. This scenario assumed that sales volumes and average selling prices fall below the levels forecast by the Group by 20% and 7.5% respectively, and that the Group’s operations are temporarily disrupted for three months due to a national response to a resurgence of the virus. The effects were modelled over a 15-month period, alongside reasonable mitigation that the Group would expect to undertake in such circumstances, primarily a reduction in investment in inventories in line with the fall in expected sales and the actions successfully deployed during the Group’s closure of its operations in March 2020. The effects have been modelled without assumption of Government assistance during this period. In all scenarios, including the reasonable worst case, the Group is able to comply with its financial covenants, operate within its current facilities, and meet its liabilities as they fall due. The intentions of Aermont and their plans for the Group on completion of the Aermont Acquisition, have been shared with the Group and are set out in the Offering Memorandum for the proposed issue of senior secured notes by Maison Finco Plc, along with Aermont’s proposed funding structure. These published intentions, stated in the Offering Memorandum, confirm an alignment to the existing strategy and support of the management team and confirm that the committed funding structure comprises £476.1m equity, £275.0m senior secured notes with a six-year maturity profile, as well as a £70.0m RCF. 11 ----- #### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 30 October 2020 With regards to the Aermont Acquisition, the Directors consider the strength of the available information on Aermont’s intentions for the Group, the funding secured and related cash flow modelling to be fully supporting of and sufficient for the continued operation of the Group in line with the projected performance and associated cash flows. Accordingly, the Directors consider there to be no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue to operate as a going concern. They have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date of approval of these condensed consolidated interim Financial Statements regardless of whether the Aermont Acquisition completes. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim Financial Statements. The Group has also reviewed its exposure to climate change and Brexit-related risks and concluded that these did not have a significant impact on the financial performance and/or position of the Group for the period and as at 31 July 2021, respectively. The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 3 to 29. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and borrowing facilities are described on pages 27 to 29 of the Strategic Report. Having considered the Group’s forecasts including its forecast cashflows, the directors are satisfied that the Company has sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct its activities and meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months. Accordingly, these financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis. Further details of the Directors’ assessment of going concern can be found in the principal accounting policies on pages 38-39. Keystone Midco Limited (the “Company” and the “Keystone Midco Group”) is a holding company and heads up a sub-group within the group headed by Keystone JVco Limited. Management have assessed going concern on a wider group basis as follows. At 31 October 2020, the wider group owned by Keystone JVco Limited (the “Keepmoat Group” or “Group”) held cash and cash equivalents of £56.8m and total loans and borrowings of £165.2m, which consisted of £0.3m of overdraft, bank and other loans of £11.6m and £157.5m of term loan facility that matures in December 2024. Should further funding be required, the Group has a committed £75m RCF (of which £0.2m was utilised at 31 October 2020), subject to compliance with certain financial covenants, of which £15.0m matures in December 2021 and £60.0m matures in June 2024. As such, in consideration of its net current assets of £315.0m, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its current liabilities and working capital requirements. The performance of the Group is dependent upon a number of external factors and the wider macro-economic environment in which it operates. The factors that particularly affect the performance of the Group are described in the strategic report (pages 3-21), with the principle risks and uncertainties that may impact the Group outlined (pages 22-26). The material factors that may affect the future financial performance of the Group include flat or negative economic growth, buyer confidence, mortgage availability and affordability, new housing supply, falls in house prices or land values and the cost and availability of materials, subcontractors and suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to an increase in the inherent uncertainty in the Group’s assessment of these factors. Since the restart of construction and sales activity in May 2020 post lockdown, the UK housing market has seen strong demand with reservations and sales recovering to pre-lockdown levels, and the Group’s construction activity has returned to normal levels and delivery has been aligned to demand accordingly. However, the outlook for the economy remains unclear: unemployment is expected to rise when the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme comes to an end in April 2021 and market activity could be affected by the impact of the UK’s new post Brexit trading relationship with the EU. Future outbreaks of COVID-19 and consequent local or national restrictions may cause further disruption to the Group’s activities. The Group has extended its existing super senior revolving credit and fixed term debt facilities by £27.5m during the year to 31 October 2020. Furthermore, the Group received £7.5m of capital investment from its shareholders in July 2020. Under the extension of the super senior revolving credit facility, the Group was bound to a new covenant requiring a minimum of £20m of available liquidity at each month end and £30m of available liquidity at the end of each quarter. This covenant applies from July 2020 until December 2021. The Group’s financial forecasts reflect the Directors considered view of expected performance, based on the information available at the date of signing of these Financial Statements. This includes the ongoing costs of COVID-19 safe working practices implemented by the Group. To assess the Group’s resilience to adverse trading conditions, its financial forecast has been sensitised through a series of scenarios reflecting the principal downside risks for the UK economy and housing market. The scenarios reflect potential downside risks as presented in the latest available external economic forecasts. This exercise included an aggregated reasonable worst-case scenario reflecting a manifestation of the principal risks to a severe but plausible level. This scenario assumed that sales volumes and average selling prices fall below the Group’s forecast levels by 20% and 7.5% respectively, and that the Group’s operations are temporarily disrupted for three months due to a national response to a resurgence of the virus. 38 ----- ### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020 The directors have considered the adequacy of the Group’s financial resources through a review of the financial projections for the business and taking into account the refinancing of the Group’s debt during the year. The Group drew down a £150m term loan and a new RCF facility on 11 December 2018, for further details see note 15. After careful consideration the directors are satisfied that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the date of signing the financial statements.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below - **Estimation of development profitability The gross profit from revenue generated on each of the Group’s developments in a specific period is based on the latest forecast for the whole site gross profit expected to be generated over the life of that development or phase. The expected gross profit is calculated as an output of development valuations completed using latest selling prices and forecasts of all land and construction costs associated with the development. These calculations of expected gross profits require a degree of estimation due to their long-term nature and are sensitive to future movements in both the estimated cost to complete and expected selling prices. Group’s management has established internal controls to regularly review and ensure the appropriateness of the forecasts and estimates made on an individual development basis. However, a change in estimated gross profits over a number of developments (due, for example, to changes in estimates of costs remaining or a reduction in average selling prices in the private market) could materially affect profitability. As an illustration, a reasonably possible change in profits of 1% across all developments in the 9 months to 31 July 2021 would have reduced gross profit and net assets by an estimated £4.8m. - **The right to develop land under a build lease The Group enters arrangements with land-owners under which it acquires an interest in land under a build lease with the benefit of a right to develop. The directors judge these arrangements as in-substance purchases and not leases under the scope of IFRS 16. This is on the basis that the Group has physical possession of the land and has accepted the asset and the land-owner has an enforceable right to payment, the freehold is passed to the end customer; the Group takes on any risks associated with the land and ultimately benefits from the reward on sale of the developed plots. On this basis, land rights acquired under these arrangements are treated as inventories and are held at the lower of cost or net realisable value as per the Group’s accounting policy for inventories. - **Acquisition accounting When applying IFRS3 principles to the step-acquisition of a subsidiary, the directors exercise judgment in determining the fair value of equity instruments and the non-controlling interest. These judgments are integral to the recognition of the consolidated assets into the Group. 12 ----- #### Keystone Midco Limited Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended 31 July 2021 The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group’s management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.

The methods used to value such intangible assets require the use of estimates. Future results are impacted by the length of amortisation periods adopted, and changes to the estimated useful lives which would result in different effects on the income statement and balance sheet. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, along with finite life intangible assets and other assets of the Group’s cash generating units. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions (including discount rates, timing of cash flows and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective. - **Fair value on land acquired at a discount to market value Where the Group enters into specific arrangements with partners who provide discounted land in return for the provision of social housing, the fair value of the housing units provided, which equates to the open market value of the discount to land, is reflected in the financial statements. Land value in the balance sheet is therefore reflected at its fair value with this fair value being released to revenue and cost of sales as the land is sold. - **Estimation of costs to complete, work in progress and contract provisions In order to determine the profit and loss that the Group is able to recognise on its developments in a specific period, the Group has to allocate total costs to the developments between the proportion completing in the period and the proportion to complete in a future period. The assessment of total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation. However, Group management has established internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made on an individual site basis. - **Discounting of development land payables Where the Group enters into long-term payable arrangements with vendors of land, the Group discounts the value of land acquired to reflect the time value of money. The Group relies on forecast future land payment dates and an estimated cost of the Group’s incremental capital cost to perform the discounting calculation. 34 ----- ### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018 The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Company’s management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.

I am extremely proud of the way the Executive Team, led by Tim Beale, have steered the business safely through the crisis with the support of our highly competent senior management team. I would like to thank the Executive Board and the wider Leadership team and Regional Directors, across the business, who also showed their support by taking a voluntary 20% salary reduction for the period that our sites had to be closed during the first national lockdown. This was an act of outstanding leadership and clearly demonstrates their commitment to Keepmoat Homes. The value of our Partnership Business model was once again demonstrated last year when it was tested under extreme circumstances, with the strength of our relationships with our Partners helping us to steer the business safely through the Pandemic. The Board and our lenders are confident that our unique Partnership Business Model will continue to drive our future success. This was clearly demonstrated last year when we were able to increase our credit facilities by £27.5 million and our shareholders signalled their continued support with an injection of additional equity, and the business embarked on a programme of significant investment in new IT infrastructure.

Keepmoat Homes is an excellent business and, importantly, it is a different type of home builder which is uniquely placed to serve the needs of the UK today. It is the UK’s largest dedicated partnership home builder focused on building sustainable communities. Keepmoat is committed to putting customers first delivering high quality affordable homes, using a mix of tenures across the country. One of Keepmoat’s defining features is its quality product at affordable prices. With an average selling price of £161,000, Keepmoat helps customers achieve their aspirations of owning their own homes, with 70% of the homes we sell, on the open market, being sold to first time buyers. With a presence in all of the top 10 markets outside London, we are a trusted partner to Homes England, local authorities and registered providers, with many of these relationships enduring for over 20 years. These trusted and lasting partnerships underpin our multi-tenure strategy and our position as a top 10 UK home builder, ranked 8[th] in terms of the number of homes we deliver across the country each year. Our work with registered providers and the build-to-rent market (or private rented sector) is increasingly important to us, as our partners want to see more multi-tenure developments. Furthermore, as the UK’s leading brownfield homebuilder with 80% of current developments on brownfield sites, our work goes beyond the delivery of new homes. By regenerating urban and brownfield land, we give life to thriving new communities and we are delighted to see increased support for bringing forward brownfield land from the public sector. It is this special business model which helps drive our operational and financial performance. It enables Keepmoat to successfully deliver the right products, at the right price, in the right places, while boosting revenues and improving our return on capital, which is one of the highest among our peers. I am particularly excited at the prospect of working with Chief Executive Tim Beale again, having previously worked together for around 20 years. The changes he has successfully implemented since his appointment as CEO have seen Keepmoat strengthen its position as a leading UK homebuilder with a balanced business model, putting customers at the heart of the journey, while implementing and maintaining the highest standards of build quality and operational efficiency. It is these factors which will underpin our exciting growth strategy which we will continue to execute over the coming years. While it is early in my tenure as Chairman, I would like to thank each and every one of our people for all their hard work every day, our reliable supply chain and our strategic business partners for their commitment to Keepmoat. Finally, the Board is confident that our unique business model will continue to drive significant growth in quality homes delivered, revenues and profits in the current financial year and beyond. Stephen Stone Lloyds Bank plc 3rd Floor 10 Gresham Street London EC2V 7JD ----- ### Strategic Report Introduction After seven years with Keepmoat Homes, I have taken the decision to step down as Chief Executive Officer. I made this decision with the full support of the Board following the successful refinance of the business, which follows a period of very strong growth at Keepmoat Homes which has seen the business treble in size in the last five years and following the very successful sale of Keepmoat Regeneration two years ago. I am delighted to say that I will become a Non-Executive Director of Keepmoat Homes and remain fully involved in that capacity. The new financing arrangements put in place an improved debt package for the business to support its continued growth over the next six years and offers improved terms including lower costs and increased financial capacity to ensure that Keepmoat Homes can continue to move forward with its strategy of controlled and profitable growth. This is an extremely positive step and reflects the confidence of our lenders in the business. The funding deal increases our total available debt facilities to £205m (previously £175m) providing greater support for us to deliver our growth plans.  We have a pipeline of over 30,000 plots and are well positioned to deliver our multi-tenure strategy and to continue to increase the supply of homes across the country. We have also changed our financial year end from March to October in order to support our continued growth plans by optimising the timing of our year-end from both a sales and build perspective.  In the resulting seven-month accounting period to 31 October 2018 we delivered 2,108 high quality new homes across the UK and recorded revenues of £324.2m. For the 12 months to October 2018 we delivered 3,988 new homes, 271 more than the 12 months to March 2018 and we saw an increase in our revenues of 12.7% to £597m. Finally, I am delighted to say that Tim Beale, previously our Chief Operating Officer and Deputy CEO, has stepped up to become Chief Executive Officer. Tim joined us in May 2017 and has made a significant contribution to the group in this time. Having spent his whole career in the housebuilding industry, Tim’s arrival at Keepmoat followed 14 years at Crest Nicholson, latterly as a member of the executive board and Chairman of the South West, Chiltern and Southern divisions. I am fully confident that under Tim’s leadership the business will go from strength to strength as he focusses on what we do best – looking after our fantastic people to ensure that we can continue to provide high quality homes that we can be proud to deliver to our customers.

The last financial year has been one where we have faced unprecedented challenges with the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic continuing to affect all aspects of our daily lives. However, I am delighted to report that on the back of a very positive start to the year, whilst our financial and operational results were significantly impacted by the period of shutdown and ongoing economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19, our business has demonstrated the resilience of the multi tenure partnership model, and we are in a strong position moving forwards and well set up to deliver our future growth plans. We made a good start to the year with positive post-election sentiment and demand for new homes reflected in excellent sales figures and the business trading in line with our expectations for the period to March, before the onset of the pandemic. Demand for new homes has remained strong throughout as one of the effects of the Pandemic has been to make people place greater value on owning their own homes with flexible space for living, working, exercising and relaxing. Our predominantly First Time Buyer audience and average selling price of £165,000 has further supported our continued strong performance. In fact, our forward order book and pipeline in all our regions remain strong across all tenures, this forward visibility positions us well for investment and growth in the future. When the UK entered its first national lockdown, as a responsible home builder, we prioritised the safety of our people, our customers and the communities we work with and took the decision to temporarily cease operations. All our developments were closed in a safe and secure manner at the start of April 2020, with surplus PPE donated to NHS Trusts and Charities to support medical staff and key workers. During the shutdown period, the business supported customers who were ready to complete, as lockdown restrictions came into force, to ensure that they were able to safely move into their new homes. Throughout the first national lockdown interest and demand for new homes remained strong, with our sales teams working remotely and many customers choosing to reserve their new homes online. As lockdown restrictions began to be eased in May, the business implemented a phased reopening programme. Sales offices were reopened with the creation of a bespoke online appointment booking system to allow customers to visit our sales centres and show homes across the UK safely, in line with Government and Public Health guidelines. In the previous financial year, we had already invested in digital technologies to re-engineer the customer journey to make the process of buying a new home even easier and more closely aligned to the expectations of our young customer demographic. This investment has paid dividends, with the reserve online tool enabling the business to continue to sell homes whilst sales offices were closed during lockdown. Further enhancements including the appointment booking system and an online payment tool to enable all payments to be made via the website, enabled sales offices to reopen safely, operating on an appointment only basis and minimising unnecessary contacts. The bookings tool has provided additional benefits to the business with improved visibility on footfall to sites, enabling staffing levels to be optimised accordingly. Looking ahead and building on the success of the Reserve Online tool, phase two is now in development to include additional features such as ID checks, anti-money laundering checks and electronic document signing. 3 ----- ### Strategic Report Chief Executive’s Strategic Update I was delighted to take over the role of Chief Executive Officer at Keepmoat Homes in February 2019 and to be given the opportunity to steer the business through its next phase of growth and development. The last 12 months have been a truly transformational period for Keepmoat Homes which has seen us focus on establishing a strong management team and creating a high-performance culture where our people feel valued and empowered to deliver success. This was recognised through our recent Investors In People (IIP) Audit, where our assessor, who has been involved with Keepmoat Homes for a number of years, paid tribute to the remarkable turnaround in the business describing it in his report as ‘huge and quite amazing’ in terms of the enormity of change and the level of progress and commitment in a relatively short period of time. We still have more to do, as these changes have not yet permeated every area of the business, but I am confident that we are now in a very strong position moving forward. I believe that we now have the right people in the right roles and I am extremely proud of the management structure we have created which has enabled us to deliver an outstanding result in the financial year to 31 October 2019. We have increased our revenues by 8.8% to £649.8m and delivered 4,035 high quality new homes for our customers. As we move in to FY20 and a period of increased stability following months of political uncertainty, I am pleased to say that the market for quality new homes is strong and is particularly favourable, following the recent general election, in Keepmoat Homes’ northern heartland. This is also supported by the continued availability of mortgage products that help people get on to the property ladder by making it more affordable to buy than rent. This is key to our core First Time Buyer market. In the last financial year 70% of our Open Market Sales were to First Time Buyers and they will continue to be a focus for the business moving forward. Delivering high quality new homes and delighting our customers is our top priority, so I am pleased to say that in the 12-month reporting period, Keepmoat Homes increased its customer satisfaction score to 87.4% which is sufficient to achieve a 4-star builder status across the business and I am confident that this will increase to 5-star in early 2020. Our current score of 87.7% in the 2019 Home Builders Federation (HBF) annual customer satisfaction survey is a 12% improvement on our 2018 result and a 15% improvement on our 2017 result.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

We also made use of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, when our teams were placed on furlough, enabling us to protect the jobs of our c1,100 employees and ensure the business was in a strong position to restart as soon as it was safe to do so. Throughout this period all employees including those on furlough were paid 100% of their salary. In addition, our Executive Board, the wider Leadership team and Regional Directors across the business took a voluntary 20% salary reduction for the period that sites were closed. I would like to thank them for their commitment to supporting the business. The confidence of our lenders in the strength and resilience of the business allowed us to successfully increase our credit facilities by £27.5 million creating greater liquidity, and our shareholders signalled their continued support with an injection of additional equity. 4 ----- ### Strategic Report Chief Executive’s Strategic Update I believe that the way we have successfully steered the business through this crisis is testament to the strength of our extremely competent management team, with the right people now in the right roles to drive the business forward. I am also delighted to report that, during the last financial year, Debbie Waddington, Group HR Director, was promoted to the Executive Board, in recognition of her significant contribution and further underpinning the importance of our people to the business During the initial lockdown period, our IT team supported the business with the fast deployment of the right equipment to allow people to work from home and facilitated the adoption of video conferencing and remote team working tools supported by investment in technology in board rooms and regional offices around the country. I am extremely proud of the way our highly engaged people came together right across the business, rose to the challenge and adapted to new ways of working. During this period, we used our time effectively to plan for the future and invest in new technology. With the support of our shareholders we have committed to the adoption of DXC Home Builder One, the fully integrated homebuilder ERP solution, powered by Microsoft Dynamics 365. We are the first UK homebuilder to adopt this technology which will give us best in class systems and infrastructure to take the business forward. To spearhead this vital business transformation and lead our IT team moving forwards, Myles Gibbins has been appointed to the role of IT & Digital Director. Myles brings over 20 years’ experience in the home building industry and unrivalled knowledge and experience of delivering similar business transformation projects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1829,INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1829.74,A regional focus on national delivery,1829.74.1,,"Keepmoat Homes is committed to delivering high-quality, affordable homes across the UK, with nine regional businesses organised into two divisions: The North Division, comprising Scotland, the North West, MCI (North West), the North East and West Yorkshire; and the South Division, comprising East Yorkshire, East Midlands, West Midlands and South Midlands. A Divisional Chairman is responsible for each of the two divisions, supported by a Divisional Finance Director. The above divisional and regional structure follows a structural review conducted by the Keepmoat Homes board, under which the Groups operations were reorganised in some geographies to ensure that the business is optimally structured to continue to progress with the delivery of its growth plans. This included the merger of our Keepmoat Homes presence in the North West within a single region to leverage the combined leadership team and deliver a consolidated approach to the regional market, operating the South West region as a satellite to the West Midlands office, and the relocation of our Southern regional office from Luton to the Northamptonshire area, to focus our presence in the South Midlands geography that has proved more suitable and successful for the Keepmoat business model. The regional businesses and their boundaries will remain flexible allowing for growth and expansion into new areas where this makes sense and is required to enable all offices to remain at an optimum size for effective management. Each of the regional businesses has its own management board and is empowered to deliver our overarching operational excellence strategy, applying the Group’s policies and systems to local markets and circumstances. This structure and approach mean that we are well positioned for future growth in the right locations. Over the past twelve months we have continued to concentrate driving excellence in all areas of the business including launching our Operational Excellence Strategy and introducing even greater rigour to manage our sites holistically to fully optimise our development economics over the full lifecycle of our developments. With enhanced financial processes and reporting, this enables us to ensure we are buying land with the right margins and in the right locations.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1829,INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1829.78,Positive Market Positioning,1829.78.1,,"The fundamental underpinnings for the UK Housing Market have remained strong including Government support, low interest rates and increased desire and aspiration to own a home. This has remained true despite the unprecedented challenges imposed by the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic, the continued uncertainty over the impact of the future relationship and trade agreements with the EU and the resulting uncertainty around employment and negative impacts on the wider economy. Keepmoat, with an average sales price of £165,000 and limited exposure to London and the South East, performed well to the end of March 2020 with sales across all regions in line with our expectations. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the period of shutdown that resulted had an impact during the remainder of 2020. Accordingly, the Board has continued to consider the potential effect on our business and has updated risk assessments. Key risks have been identified, such as the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK economy, supply and cost of materials, the impact on availability of labour and potential changes to Government policy and regulation. The business has appropriate mitigation plans in place to address any adverse impacts should they arise. Most of our building supplies are manufactured in the UK and are not at risk from future trade arrangements with the EU. An element of the products procured through our network of UK based suppliers will be imported from the EU and we are working closely with those suppliers to monitor the potential impact as the UK adapts to the new trade arrangements with the EU. We believe that the Group’s multi-tenure partnership approach and expertise in the first-time buyer market provides some resilience should any adverse market effects arise because of the COVID19 pandemic. We will continue to closely monitor market conditions into the future considering wider political and economic developments. The fundamental underpinnings for the UK Housing Market are strong, including Government support, health of mortgage lenders, constrained supply, general aspiration to own a home, a high level of employment and relatively low interest rates. However, since the result of the referendum vote to leave the European Union (EU) in June 2016, there has been a significant amount of uncertainty for business and consumers which has manifested itself differently in different sectors of the housing market. Fortunately, Keepmoat, with an average sales price of £161,000 and limited exposure to London and the South East has remained virtually unaffected in the year to 31 October 2019 with sales across all regions remaining healthy and in line with our expectations. Since the General Election in December 2019 market and customer sentiment has reflected a greater sense of political stability. Despite this the terms of the future relationship and trade agreements with the EU remain uncertain. Accordingly, the Board has continued to consider the potential effect on our business and has updated risk assessments. Key risks have been identified, such as the supply and cost of materials, the impact on availability of labour and potential changes to Government policy and regulation.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1829,INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1829.79,Government commitment to housing supply,1829.79.1,,"The policy landscape of the last 12 months has combined short-term responses to the pandemic with a post-election change of direction for planning and housebuilding. One of the most promising visions of the new government was to ‘level up’ and support those parts of the country that had been left behind. The Prime Minister’s ‘Build, Build, Build’ speech in June established the central role of housebuilding and construction in spearheading national economic recovery after the first COVID-19 lockdown. Since then, housebuilding has been supported through the Stamp Duty holiday on properties up to the value of £500,000 until 31 March 2021, more flexible construction site working hours, creation of the Construction Talent Retention Scheme and extended planning permission deadlines with planning committees also meeting remotely. The Help to Buy build and completion deadlines have been extended by two months to allow completion of delayed homes. Help to Buy is a popular and vital scheme that provides choice for homebuyers and stimulates construction of new homes. Keepmoat has supported a refocusing of the scheme on first time buyers from April 2021, with the majority of our homes being priced within the new Help to Buy price thresholds. We continue to work with both government agencies and mortgage providers on innovative mortgage products and other alternatives to the successful Help to Buy schemes. 7 ----- ### Strategic Report Chief Executive’s Strategic Update We welcome elements of the Planning White Paper which includes positives for housebuilders. More speed and predictability in planning decisions will enable us to build many more homes while national standardisation, especially in space standards, will enable us to do so more efficiently. We also welcome a green agenda that prioritises brownfield land and requires energy efficiency, biodiversity and sustainable development. A national planning system, charged with a desire to level up all areas of the UK, is a powerful post-pandemic vision. If we are moving to an era of more homeworking, homebuyers will have greater flexibility on where they live and will be able to choose to buy in areas where their money goes further. In these areas they will be able to afford houses, rather than apartments, with more space, more rooms and larger gardens. Supporting those ambitions is a key driver of Keepmoat’s business. We note the recent Government announcement that it is committed to funding and supporting the removal of unsafe cladding on highrise buildings. Keepmoat Homes has conducted a desktop review and has not identified the need for any remedial works associated with the removal of combustible cladding in relation to multi occupancy residential structures in its legacy development portfolio. In support of industry initiatives to improve fire safety moving forwards Keepmoat Homes has become a registered signatory to The Building A Safer Charter Declaration of Commitment which is designed to drive the culture change and action required to improve building safety by making improvements to current practice and behaviours. We welcome the ongoing cross-party consensus on the importance of housebuilding and the particular focus and support from all the main political parties on building more affordable homes during the 2019 General Election. In addition, the Government continues to support new home building with the extension of Help to Buy until 2023, albeit with reforms restricting the scheme to support First Time Buyers from 2021 onwards. We welcome these reforms which will ensure that funding is available to the people who need it most. We believe Help to Buy is a successful scheme that has supported new development whilst helping more people to buy a new home. The operating environment has been uncertain for three years due to the UK’s decision to leave the European Union (EU), with shortterm disruption to existing trade and regulatory arrangements, uncertainty around the long-term relationship with the EU and the potential political fall-out from a no-deal Brexit. Whilst we recognise the heightened risk profile associated with the Brexit process, Keepmoat Homes is in a strong position offering affordably priced homes, with a good range and choice of affordable house types available across our key markets. Post General Election, the UK now has a degree of political stability but still has a degree of uncertainty regarding a trade agreement with the EU. Despite this uncertainty, the prevailing economic and political backdrop for the industry is positive. Home ownership is still 5 ----- ### Strategic Report Chief Executive’s Strategic Update the tenure of choice for the majority of people, and this combined with the long-term undersupply of new housing means that underlying demand remains strong. We look forward to the content of the Government’s Planning White Paper in the year ahead, which will be designed to make the planning process clearer, more accessible and more certain. Further measures are expected in the March Budget, including devolving strategic planning powers to combined authorities across England, the First Homes initiative and liberalisation of planning regulations in regard to upwards extensions to properties. We also support the Government’s initiatives to assist the increase in output from the industry towards its goal of reaching 300,000 new homes built each year, across multiple tenures, by the mid-2020’s. We remain committed to contributing to this increase in new home delivery and Keepmoat Homes is well positioned to deliver new developments, with an emphasis on first time buyers and first-time movers. The fundamentals of the housing market are sound, with lenders keen to lend at low fixed rates, average wages rising and employment at a record high. The increase in buyer demand since the General Election would indicate that buyers and sellers feel the election result has finally provided a window of stability. The alignment of Keepmoat Homes with the ambitions of Government and our public-sector partners means we are optimistic about our future at the heart of the UK housing market. The Government continues to show strong commitment to the housebuilding sector with a view to meeting its target of building 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s, thereby increasing housing supply to its highest levels since the 1970s. We are pleased to see broad cross-party support for this commitment. Major landmarks in support of this policy were the revised National Planning Policy Framework, the Autumn Budget and the final report of the independent review of build-out rates, the Letwin Review. Outside these landmark policy announcements, new funding was announced in June and September to support affordable homebuilding, local authority borrowing, land assembly and small sites. The revised National Planning Policy Framework ensures that more land in the right places is available for housing. We welcome its provisions for leadership at local authority and city region levels, including an emphasis on good design, broadening of the range of affordable tenures recognised, and continued preference for brownfield development. Many of these measures can accelerate the delivery of new homes by reducing local opposition and shortening planning processes. Further planning reforms were announced for consultation later in the year, applying common sense to existing restrictions. New permitted development rights will allow upwards extensions above commercial premises and residential properties, including blocks of flats, and allow commercial buildings to be demolished and replaced with homes. At the same time, Government proposes giving greater freedom to local authorities to dispose of land at an undervalue. The 2018 Autumn Budget met two key requests for support. The Chancellor renewed the Help to Buy equity loan scheme for first time buyers until March 2023 and, in a measure trailed in the Prime Minister’s speech to Conservative Party Conference, abolished the Housing Revenue Account cap that controls local authority borrowing for house building. Alongside these flagship announcements were another £500 million for the Housing Infrastructure Fund, support for £1 billion of lending to SME housebuilders and, addressing a loophole for our housing association customers, Stamp Duty Land Tax relief for first time buyers of shared ownership homes. The Letwin review into build-out rates talked the language of mixed-tenure in recommending greater diversity on large sites in areas of high housing demand. New powers for local authorities, alongside guidance for developers, will help to avoid saturation of local markets. We will find out in 2019 whether the Government welcomes this approach or feels it needs to do more to force the build out of planning consents.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Uncertainty in the market and basic supply/demand economics may also drive UK manufactured product prices higher as the rates for imported products increase. We have worked closely with our supply chain since the result of the vote to leave the European Union to ensure that we understand the changes arising from Brexit. We have continued with this close engagement since the confirmation of the new trade arrangements to understand their challenges and contingency strategies. These include careful monitoring, increasing UK stock holding and diverting imports to alternative UK ports where bottlenecks are predicted. At this stage, we have not experienced any significant supply chain issues associated with Brexit. The fundamental underpinnings for the UK Housing Market are strong, including Government support, health of mortgage lenders, constrained supply, general aspiration to own a home, a high level of employment and relatively low interest rates. However, since the UK vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, there has been an increasing amount of uncertainty for business and consumers which is manifesting itself differently in different sectors of the housing market. Fortunately, Keepmoat, with an average sales price of around £154,000, has remained virtually unaffected in the 7 months to October 2018 with sales across all regions remaining healthy and in line with our expectations. Given the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit and its economic impact the Group has continued to consider the potential effect on our business and has carried out appropriate risk assessments.

This year has tested the effectiveness of our risk management and increased the residual risk associated with some of our principal risks and, whilst a global pandemic was not specifically called out in previous risk registers, its potential impacts and how we mitigate them certainly were and this is reflected in the direction of travel of some of the risks identified below: The Health & Safety Executive visited our sites on nine occasions and took no enforcement action and in recognition of our performance we were awarded the Gold Award by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA).",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

The resilience of our multi-tenure partnership business model, the immediate action taken by the Board, our recent balance sheet strengthening and our strong forward order book position us well to return to our planned growth in the medium term.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1829,INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1829.142,Financial Performance,1829.142.1,,"The Group delivered a resilient performance in the year given that COVID-19 resulted in the suspension of activities at our sites and sales offices from the start of April in line with the Government’s guidelines. The Group’s sites remained closed until the 11th May when twenty-four sites were reopened with limited construction activities commencing on plots at an advanced stage of build, with a further thirty-three sites opening during the month. By August we were operating on all our developments. Whilst we kept our sales centres open virtually through the lockdown period, demonstrating the effectiveness of our digital sales capabilities, we nevertheless experienced a reduced level of reservations during this period given that in person sales office and show home visits were not possible. Our sales offices in England were reopened on the 29th May, with those in Scotland following on the 12th June. Despite the impact of COVID-19, the Group delivered total completions of 2,460 homes in the year to 31 October 2020 (“FY20”), down 39.0% on the prior year (2019: 4,035 homes). As a result, revenue fell by 37.5% to £406.0m (2019: £649.8m). The average selling price of completions increased by 2.5% to £165k (2019: £161k). Our delivery to Registered Providers & the Private Rented Sector made up 30.3% of the Group’s volume (2019: 33.8%) reflecting the focus on our mixed tenure partnership model and providing resilience in the long term. Our contribution reduced by £54.9m to £64.7m (2019: £119.6m) with the decline primarily reflecting the reduction in completion volumes, and COVID-19 related costs, including disruption to site build programmes, site overhead inefficiency during remobilisation, and increased provisions in relation to pre-development work in progress on a limited number of sites, reflecting the evolving risk profile in the wider market. This year we delivered an adjusted EBIT of £11.4m (2019: £61.1m) largely as a result of the COVID-19 impact on both volumes and costs. The Group’s adjusted EBIT margin reduced to 2.8% (2019: 9.4%) reflecting the lower contribution margin and the non-recurring impact of non-productive site overhead costs of £5.7m that would normally be capitalised to WIP which were instead expensed during the period of lockdown. These effects were partially mitigated through receipt of £3.5m of grants from the Governments CJRS for those employees furloughed during the period of the temporary closure of the Group’s operations and the effect of COVID-19 on the Group’s discretionary annual bonus schemes for which nothing was payable for this financial year. Net financing costs at £25.5m were £3.4m higher than the prior year due to the levels of borrowing during the year and the cost of increasing our facilities. As a result, the Group delivered a loss before tax of £18.0m (2019: profit before tax £37.2m) for the year.

These actions included a reduction in pay of 20% for the Group’s Executive board, Regional Directors and Senior Leaders in the business for a period whilst our sites remained closed. We also negotiated an increase of the Group’s senior term loan and super senior revolving credit facility, which alongside a further capital investment from the Group’s shareholders ensure the strong liquidity of the Group and evidence the good relationships that Keepmoat Homes has with its banking partners. The components of the increased facilities and capital investments were secured in the following tranches: On 18 March 2020, the Group increased its super senior revolving credit facility by £5.0m, bringing the total limit to £60.0m. The terms of the additional limit are in line with the existing facility.

The Group incurred and capitalised total issue costs of £1.25m as a result of increasing the two existing debt facilities. On 15 June 2020, the Group also received £7.5m of additional funding from its shareholders in the form of the purchase of shares in Keystone JVCo Limited, the company's ultimate parent undertaking.

The effects have been modelled without assumption of Government assistance during this period. The Directors have taken into their considerations the national restrictions currently in place at the date in February 2021. In all scenarios, including the reasonable worst case, the Group is able to comply with its financial covenants, operate within its current facilities, and meet its liabilities as they fall due. Accordingly, the Directors consider there to be no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue to operate as a going concern. They have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group, and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date of signing of these Financial Statements.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1829,INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1829.192,Basis of consolidation,1829.192.1,,"The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Keystone Midco Limited, its subsidiary undertakings and the Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates. (a) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred, and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed in administrative costs as incurred. All identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, and contingent liabilities assumed are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest as compared with the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets are recognised as goodwill. Where the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the total consideration transferred, a gain from a bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the income statement after the fair values initially determined have been reassessed. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with accounting policies adopted by the Group. (b) Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, interest in joint ventures is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income. Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds its equity accounted investment in a joint venture, the carrying amount of the equity interest is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations. Appropriate adjustment is made to the results of joint ventures where material differences exist between a joint venture’s accounting policies and those of the Group. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of the impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in the income statement adjacent to its share of profit/(loss) from associates. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 39 ----- ### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020 The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Keystone Midco Limited, its subsidiary undertakings and the Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates.

Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. (c) Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method, applying the same policy as set out for joint ventures above. 35 ----- ### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2019 The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Keystone Midco Limited, its subsidiary undertakings and the Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1829,INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1829.195,Revenue and profit recognition,1829.195.1,,"Revenue is recognised based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This can lead to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. Primarily, for those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from registered providers for the provision of housing or where the Group undertakes development contracts, revenue is recognised based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. The directors consider the provision of land and residential properties to represent a single performance obligation which represents a judgement taken in the application of IFRS 15. _Sale of housing to open market customers_ Revenue and profits associated with the sale of housing to private open market customers are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on legal completion. Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable on legal completion. Open market sale plots are recognised at the agreed sales price deemed to be fair value. In certain instances, property may be accepted in part consideration for a sale of a residential property. The fair value established is reduced for estimated costs to sell. Net sale proceeds generated from the subsequent sale of part exchange properties are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales. The original sale is recorded in the normal way, with the fair value of the exchanged property replacing cash receipts. Part exchange properties are held within Inventories at net realisable value until subsequent sale. _Sale of housing to registered provider customers and associated development contracts with stage payments_ The Group constructs and sells residential properties and undertakes associated development activities under long-term contracts with customers. Such contracts are entered into before construction of residential properties or associated development activities begin. Under the terms of the contracts, the Group is continually restricted from redirecting the properties or development works to another customer and has an enforceable right to payment for work done. Revenue from construction of residential properties and associated development activities is therefore recognised over time based on a certified monthly valuation of work performed or the assessed physical stage of completion at the balance sheet date. The directors consider that this method is an appropriate measure of the progress towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations under IFRS 15. On the balance sheet, the Group reports the net contract position for each contract as either an asset or a liability. A contract represents an asset where costs incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses) exceed progress billings; a contract represents a liability where the opposite is the case. _Sale of housing to registered provider customers without stage payments_ Revenue and profits associated with these activities are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on legal completion as this is the point at which control is passed from the Group to the purchaser. _Profit recognition_ Gross profit is recognised for all house sales (to open market customer and to registered providers) and associated development activities, when the related revenue is recognised in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy, based on the latest forecast for the gross margin expected to be generated over the life of the development or phase of the development. The expected gross margin to be generated from each development is calculated as an output of a development valuation completed using latest selling prices and forecasts of all land and construction costs associated with that development. The application of a whole site margin to determine development profitability is a judgement taken in the application of IFRS 15. The estimation methodology used to determine the gross profit margin recognised on each development was refined during the year, this change in methodology did not have a material effect on the gross profit recognised in the year, of £64.8m. 40 ----- ### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020 Revenue is recognised based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred.

This can lead to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. Primarily, for those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from registered providers of housing, revenue will be recognised based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. The majority of the Group’s revenue and profit, including revenue from open market sales, will continue to be recognised on legal completion. _Sale of housing to open market customers_ Revenue and profits associated with these activities are included in the financial statements on legal completion. Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable upon legal completion. Open market sale plots are recognised at the agreed sales price deemed to be fair value. _Sale of housing to registered provider customers – with stage payments_ The Group constructs and sells residential properties under long-term contracts with customers. Such contracts are entered into before construction of residential properties begins.

This assessment takes into consideration changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been reduced. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows For loans and receivables, the amount of impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of financial assets is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets except trade receivables.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited for open market housebuilding activities as the Group typically receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales. The credit risk relating to registered provider sales depends on the individual characteristics of the contract counterparty many of whom are in the public sector or are funded by the public sector (e.g. housing associations).

Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The Group rents surplus property under short and medium-term arrangements. Income is recognised over the period of lease when the Group can reliably measure likely flow of economic benefits. These are treated as operating lease arrangements. _Accounting policy applied from 1 November 2019 (IFRS 16)_ The Group leases various show home properties, office space, cars and plant hire used in construction and development. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 6 months to 14 years but may have extension options. Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, for leases of real estate for which the Group is a lessee and for which it has major leases, it has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead accounts for these as a single lease component. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. Prior to 1 January 2019, leases of property, plant and equipment were classified as either finance leases or operating leases. For financial periods commencing from 1 January 2019, leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: - Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; - Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; - Amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees; - The exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and - Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option. Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. 43 ----- ### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset. Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: - The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability; - Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; - Any initial direct costs; and - Restoration costs. Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life. Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straightline basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and some plant on hire.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised in full if future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are only offset to the extent that that there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

In testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the recoverable amount of the Group has been determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the forecast revenue and profit, discount rates and long-term growth rates by market sector. Future forecast revenue is based on management’s knowledge of actual results from prior years and latest forecasts for the current year, along with secured works, management’s expectation of the future level of work available within the market sector and expected changes in selling volumes and prices for completed houses. In establishing future profit margins, the margins currently being achieved are considered in conjunction with expected inflation rates in each cost category and the current market value of land being acquired. Cash flows beyond the five-year plan period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% (31 October 2019: 2%) per annum. The growth rate used is an estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the market sectors where the Group operates. A pre-tax discount rate of 11.9% (31 October 2019: 10.7%) has been applied, being the estimated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for current market conditions. Following the UK’s exit from the European Union and the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has undertaken a detailed exercise around assumptions used in the cash flows noted above and a sensitivity analysis on those cashflows. The sensitivity analysis to changes in cashflow indicated head-room which was materially above the carrying value, so the directors are of the opinion that no impairment of goodwill is required.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Net realisable value for land where construction of homes had commenced at the year-end or is anticipated to commence within the next 12 months was assessed by estimating selling prices and costs (including sales and marketing expenses) taking into account current market conditions. Land where house building had not commenced at the year-end and was more likely to be sold undeveloped is assessed by re-appraising the land using current selling prices and costs for the proposed development and assuming an appropriate financial return to reflect the current housing market conditions and the prevailing financing environment. At the year-end, the net realisable value provision amounts to £nil (31 October 2019: £nil). This provision will be closely monitored for adequacy and appropriateness as regards under and over provision to reflect circumstances at future balance sheet dates. Government grants are recognised as deferred income and are allocated to the income statement over the useful lives of the related assets. The effect of this treatment is to reduce the fair value of work in progress by £7,421,000 (31 October 2019: £11,665,000) and to reduce cost of sales in the income statement by £1,379,000 (31 October 2019: £2,299,000).

The reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are therefore recognised in the opening balance sheet on 1 November 2019. On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as operating leases under the principles of IAS 17 Leases. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of 1 November 2019. The weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on 1 November 2019 varied depending on asset type and length of lease. In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard: - Applying a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics; - Relying on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous as an alternative to performing an impairment review – there were no onerous contracts as at 1 November 2019; - Accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 November 2019 as short-term leases; - Excluding initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application; and - Using hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease. The Group has also elected not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease at the date of initial application. Instead, for contracts entered into before the transition date the Group relied on its assessment made applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease. The associated right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on a retrospective basis as if the new rules had always been applied. Other right-of use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the balance sheet as at 31 October 2019. The following is a reconciliation of total operating lease commitments at 31 October 2019 (as disclosed in the financial statements to 31 October 2019) to the lease liabilities recognised at 1 November 2019:",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1829,INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1829.392,Introducing Digital Technology to our Customer Experience,1829.392.1,,"Our customers are early adopters of new technologies and many of their day to day experiences are conducted online, from shopping to consuming media. In 2019 we re-engineered our customer journey, using digital technologies to make the process of buying a home even easier, and more closely aligned to our customers’ expectations. Our customers can now reserve online from the comfort of their own home and receive a series of automated e-mail communications with helpful information at each key stage of their journey with us. The transformation of the customer journey has been driven by investment in a new website and other associated technology. This provides an improved showcase for our products and offers visitors a first-class user experience resulting in higher enquiry volumes (15% increase year on year). The new platform also offers greater scalability, enabling us to add new features and functionality cost effectively and in an agile manner. We have launched ‘My Keepmoat’, an account which allows our customers to manage and personalise their buying journey with Keepmoat Homes. Over 3,000 potential buyers have created accounts since going live in September 2019. We have also started to introduce digital technology to our sales offices through the addition of interactive touchscreen technologies, providing our sales advisors with tools which enable our customers to visualise their future home and street, even before the first homes are built. This is particularly beneficial for Keepmoat Homes as 84% of our homes are sold off plan and visual cues are a key influencer of buyer behaviour. 10 ----- ### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths Finally, a new web-based platform has been developed to enable customers to personalise their Kitchen and Bathrooms, selecting options and extras for their new home. Customers can do this at home or on a tablet in the sales office. As well as improving revenue from options and extras, we anticipate that the new functionality will increase customer satisfaction, by allowing customers to visualise different colour and product combinations ahead of them being installed.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

MMC is also an increasingly important requirement when bidding for public land, with Homes England requiring MMC across all sites brought forward through their Delivery Partner Panel (DPP3). During 2019 we secured two new Homes England schemes at Brue Farm, Highbridge and Croston Road, Leyland, both of which included a requirement to construct the homes using MMC. We have worked in partnership with ilke Homes to create a product tailored to the aspirations of the first-time buyer market and to meet the requirements of our public sector, registered provider and investor partners. MMC forms a key strand of our growth plans and fully modular units are expected to make up in the order of 5% of total output over the 2020 financial year. We are committed to increasing the number of homes we deliver using MMC and by increasing the percentage of off-site manufactured components into our traditional designs. We continue to develop new ways of working to help address challenges faced in the industry including reduced availability of skilled workforce, safety in build and a drive for increased speed of delivery, performance and quality. Currently 12% of completions were delivered in timber frame. We also use off site manufactured roof cassettes, spandrel panels and are trialling the use of pre-cut intermediate floor assemblies to increase the pre-manufactured value of our homes. We maintain a close working relationship with ilke Homes for the incorporation of a fully volumetric housing solution.

Our Group H&S department was restructured to give enhanced support to each division in the form of Divisional H&S, Environmental & Sustainability Business Partners who are experienced and professionally qualified in HSS and support the business in relation to policy, governance and guidance. Our focus on risk has been throughout all phases of a development with particular emphasis on site risks. We changed our system for assessing and controlling risk, giving responsibility to site managers who have the best understanding of our developments. This has resulted in greater ownership and improved management of H&S risks on site. We have also developed robust, clear performance standards for higher risk activities such as timber frame construction, working around underground services, falls from height and plant and pedestrian interface. We have invested in new IT H&S systems and platforms to enable us to be more efficient and effective. One such initiative saw us moving away from the traditional way of undertaking health and safety inductions, delivered on site by site managers, to these being carried out off site and on line. This has resulted in a significantly improved understanding by operatives of the precautions to be taken on site and has improved our resilience and compliance in this area. Our H&S support model has changed, to the extent that we moved away from employing internal safety advisors to regularly inspect sites to an outsourced model engaging NHBC to undertake site inspections monthly.

In testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the recoverable amount of the Group has been determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the forecast revenue and profit, discount rates and long-term growth rates by market sector. Future forecast revenue is based on management’s knowledge of actual results from prior years and latest forecasts for the current year, along with secured works, management’s expectation of the future level of work available within the market sector and expected changes in selling volumes and prices for completed houses. In establishing future profit margins, the margins currently being achieved are considered in conjunction with expected inflation rates in each cost category and the current market value of land being acquired. Cash flows beyond the five-year plan period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% (31 October 2018: 2%) per annum. The growth rate used is an estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the market sectors where the Group operates. A pre-tax discount rate of 10.7% (31 October 2018: 10.3%) has been applied, being the estimated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for current market conditions. In view of the uncertainty surrounding the UK’s decision to leave the European Union the Group has undertaken a detailed exercise around assumptions used in the cash flows noted above and a sensitivity analysis on those cashflows. The sensitivity analysis to changes in cashflow indicated headroom which was materially above the carrying value, so the directors are of the opinion that no impairment of goodwill is required. 48 ----- ### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2019 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.

Net realisable value for land where construction of homes had commenced at the year-end or is anticipated to commence within the next 12 months was assessed by estimating selling prices and costs (including sales and marketing expenses) taking into account current market conditions. Land where house building had not commenced at the year end and was more likely to be sold undeveloped is assessed by re-appraising the land using current selling prices and costs for the proposed development and assuming an appropriate financial return to reflect the current housing market conditions and the prevailing financing environment. At the year end, the net realisable value provision amounts to £nil (31 October 2018: £400,000). This provision will be closely monitored for adequacy and appropriateness as regards under and over provision to reflect circumstances at future balance sheet dates. Government grants are recognised as deferred income and are allocated to the income statement over the useful lives of the related assets. The effect of this treatment is to reduce the fair value of work in progress by £11,665,000 (31 October 2018: £9,875,000) and to reduce cost of sales in the income statement by £2,299,000 (31 October 2018: £2,011,000).",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

At 31 October 2019 the Group had bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility of £7,500,000 (31 October 2018: £37,500,000) and bank overdrafts of £6,311,000 (31 October 2018: £29,155,000).

An ageing profile of the Group’s loans and borrowings is presented in note 15. The Group’s objective is to manage liquidity by ensuring that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they become due. This will be assessed under normal and stress conditions, without incurring losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. Following the refinancing of the senior secured notes and the refinancing of the revolving credit facility the Group has released a further £22m of liquidity. The Group has rigorous cash management processes. Cash balances are reported daily with detailed analysis of variances to short term cash forecasts. Short term cash forecasts are updated monthly and are for a period of 26 weeks with the first 8 weeks on a daily basis and the remaining 18 weeks on a weekly basis. These complement a minimum of four long term quarterly cash forecasts each year which are compared to the annual cash flow budget and to previous quarterly forecasts. These facilitate management’s assessments of the Group’s expected cash performance and the associated comparison to available facilities and the Group’s covenants. Key risks to liquidity and cash balances are a decrease in the value of open market sales, a downturn in the UK housing market, deterioration in credit terms obtainable in the market from suppliers and subcontractors, a downturn in the profitability of work, delayed receipt of cash from customers and a general decline in the ability of local authorities to fund urban regeneration projects. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group continually monitors open market house sales volumes and prices; working capital levels and contract profitability; and both client and supplier credit references and credit terms with clients and suppliers to ensure they continue to be appropriate.

Following the refinancing during the year, the Group now holds facilities at floating interest rates at a margin over the London Interbank Borrowing Rate (LIBOR). This new financing has increased the liquidity of the Group but also the Group’s exposure to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. Whilst the risk of an increase in interest rate is beyond the Group’s control, management continually keeps this exposure under review. _Housing market risk_ The Group is affected by price fluctuations in the UK housing market. The market is impacted by consumer demand and employment levels and is dependent on the availability of mortgage finance. Furthermore, Government incentives, such as the “Help to Buy” scheme, have helped to stimulate consumer demand. Whilst these risks are beyond the Group’s ultimate control, risk is spread across differing business activities undertaken by the Group and the geographical regions in which it operates. _Currency risk_ The Group operates entirely in the United Kingdom and all of the Group’s revenue is generated in the United Kingdom and is denominated in pounds sterling.

Over the last 12 months I’ve worked closely with James and our Executive team to ensure we are consistently delivering quality new homes in the places where people need them. Over the next year we are focusing on our operations and plan to deliver over 4,000 new homes utilising both traditional and modular construction to help meet the country’s housing needs. We will also start on site on a number of transformational projects including Sighthill in Glasgow, Northfleet in Kent and the Waterside in Leicester. These developments are long term commitments to the regeneration of key UK cities and towns which embrace their heritage but build for their future. Keepmoat Homes has continued to strengthen its position as the UK’s largest and only dedicated partnership home builder and the leading home builder for first time buyers. We have a presence in all the top 10 markets outside London, and we are a top 10 UK home builder, ranked 7[th] in terms of the number of homes we build across the country each year. We work with Homes England, local authorities and registered providers to deliver much needed high-quality new homes across the country, with many of these relationships enduring for over 20 years. We are the largest delivery partner of Homes England and have delivered over 11,000 homes in partnership with them as a member of consecutive Delivery Partner Panels since 2009, accessing over £177m in funding initiatives to accelerate output delivery. We have used the Home Building Fund to accelerate the delivery of 2,200 homes and Help to Buy to support the ambitions of 70% of our homebuyers. In the seven months to October 2018 we built 1,578 homes for open market sale, with 72% being built for the very important first-time buyer market. The market for new affordable homes remains strong, supported by the availability of suitable mortgage products that make it more affordable to buy than rent. Government commitment to new housing also remains strong and has significant cross-party support. With the increasing demand for more new homes of all tenures to solve the UK housing crisis, Keepmoat Homes remains committed to working with its partners including local authorities, registered providers and the private rented sector (PRS). We sold 530 homes to registered providers and the build-to-rent market (or PRS) in the 7 months to October 2018 (25% of our total homes built) and this underpins our multi-tenure strategy. This includes 20 homes delivered for our partner Sigma and its PRS Real Estate Investment Trust (The PRS REIT plc), and we have a number of other sites under active consideration. These markets are important to us as our partners increasingly want to see multi-tenure development. In addition, as part of a balanced blend, they can help drive our financial performance by delivering additional volume and improving our return on capital which is already one of the highest amongst our peers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Through additional funding accessed via Homes England Shared Ownership and Affordable Housing Programme we are working in partnership with Heylo to deliver its Home Reach part rent, part buy, shared ownership scheme on our developments across the country. This will allow first-time-buyers and those on lower incomes to own their home for just 50% of the selling price with a five per cent deposit.

Our success in refining our approach to health and safety in that role throughout the 2017/18 financial year earned us a RoSPA Gold Award for 2017. That accolade recognises a very high level of performance, demonstrating well-developed occupational health and safety management systems and culture, outstanding control of risk and very low levels of error, harm and loss. RoSPA’s recognition does not mean the job is done. Our Safety, Health, Environment and Quality (SHEQ) strategy is focussed on three core areas: - Keeping people safe and healthy every day - Protecting and enhancing the environment - Being assured, informed and focussed on quality Significant progress has been made in these areas: - Active and visible leadership is being provided from the top of the Group. Our senior managers not only set an example of appropriate behaviour on site, but ensure that the Group’s expectations set a framework within which a safe culture can become embedded. - Clear and robust performance standards have been developed for five high-risk activities. We are enforcing safe working practices around plant and work at height. Our people are conscious of additional risks when assembling timber frame structures. And we have been successful in reducing incidents of underground services being struck. - A new approach to inductions is ensuring that everyone on site is fully engaged in our health and safety programme. An online training programme and test establish 100% understanding before new employees or contractors step onto a site. - An integrated approach to risk management is being taken that includes all stakeholders throughout all phases of a contract. We seek to design out risk at an early stage and ensure that sound technical decisions are not lost later in the process. - We have ensured that our contractors have Risk Assessment and Method Statements in place, but our focus is now turning to outcomes. We want to see that those statements have been adequately communicated, comprehended and complied with. Whilst our safety performance is significantly better than our peers within the HBF, the rate of improvement has stabilised, and we are committed to driving continual improvement across all aspects of health and safety. As the 2018/19 financial year starts, we are rolling out new systems and standards. Onsite inspections and audits will use contemporary software to record richer data, giving us improved management information and better understanding of incident and near miss data and trends. Having established a SHEQ Leadership and Review Process as part of our SHEQ governance arrangements, it is our intent to review performance throughout all levels of the organisation on a regular basis, always with the aim to improve our performance.

Risk management controls are integrated into our Divisional and Regional structures as well as our shared services and continue to be enhanced as our Internal Audit function becomes embedded within the business. The risk landscape is continually evolving however and as such we constantly appraise the internal and external factors that could impact our ability to deliver on our business targets and overall strategy and mitigate these accordingly. Our risk management process results in a detailed risk register being maintained for the Board and risks are reviewed regularly as part of the management reporting process and this includes a ‘bottom up’ and ‘top down’ consideration of risks. The principal risks identified and seen in the table below are considered as such because either individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on the implementation of the business strategy, financial performance, shareholder value and returns and reputation. Given the nature and severity of these risks, there has not been much movement since our last report for the March year end; however we have identified a principal risk associated with our key IT systems.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

As a consequence, this annual report addresses performance for the 7 month period to October 2018. Continuing the controlled growth seen in previous years, Keepmoat Homes delivered revenue of £324.2m for the 7 months to 31 October 2018 on 2,103 home sales with an average selling price of £154k. To provide meaningful performance comparison we have compared the unaudited 12 months to 31 October 2018 with the previous financial year to 31 March 2018 (FY18).

The key judgements can be effected by market conditions and unexpected events. _Assessments of costs to complete_ We focused upon this area because determining the carrying value of land and work in progress requires a high degree of judgement. The key judgements regarding forecasting future costs to complete can be effected by market conditions and unexpected events. _How we tailored the audit scope_ We assessed the adequacy of controls over site valuations, including costs to complete, site budget approvals, and the authorisation and recording of costs, including testing of controls over the allocation of costs to the correct sites. We visited a sample of sites to confirm the existence and condition of the work in progress, and also to evaluate the reasonableness of the assessment of stage of completion. We assessed the accuracy of management’s forecasting of site development profit against actual profits recorded. We sample tested and agreed certain costs incurred during the year included within land and build work in progress to supporting evidence as well as reviewing the proportion of that expenditure recognised as a cost of sale in the year in respect of units sold. We discussed a sample of sites with central and regional management in order to assess the reasonableness of net realisable values and corroborated the explanations received back to supporting documentation where appropriate. We performed an assessment of land and build provisions via enquiry and corroboration to supporting evidence. We tested the reconciliations from the site cashflows to the accounting system. We assessed the adequacy of controls over site valuations, including costs to complete, site budget approvals, and the authorisation and recording of costs, including testing of controls over the allocation of costs to the correct sites. We visited a sample of sites to confirm the existence and condition of the work in progress, and also to evaluate the reasonableness of the assessment of stage of completion. We assessed the accuracy of management’s forecasting of site development profit against actual profits recorded. We substantiated a sample of costs to complete per site cost-valuation reports to supporting documentation. We tested a sample of period end cost-valuation reports agreed to the site cashflows. We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates. The group has only one division consists of two statutory entities which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information due to their size. There are also a number of other group entities that contain financially significant balances which, in our view, required an audit of these specific financial statement line items. Specific audit procedures over exceptional items, administrative expenses, finance expenses, borrowings, and provisions were performed across these other components. The components over which we performed audit work represent all of the group's revenue from continuing operations and substantially all of the group's operating profit. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. All work was performed by the group audit team. ----- ### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited _Materiality_ The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall group materiality_** £860,000 (12 month period ended 31 Mar 2018: £1,400,000). How we determined it_** 5% of profit before tax from continuing activities, adjusted for interest on senior secured loan notes. _Carrying value of investments and intercompany receivables_ We focused upon this area because the underlying value in the Company is represented by balances due from the wider group and the investment held by the Company in its subsidiaries. The key judgement is the underlying cash generation and profitability of the wider group which can be affected by market conditions and unexpected events. _How we tailored the audit scope_ We assessed the adequacy of controls over the forecasting of the group and underlying controls over site valuations, including costs to complete, site budget approvals, and the authorisation and recording of costs, including testing of controls over the allocation of costs to the correct sites. We assessed the accuracy of management’s forecasting of site development profit against actual profits recorded. We performed sensitivity analysis over the forecasts of the group, specifically a decline in EBITDA (focusing on a downturn in revenue and increase in build costs) and increase in discount rate. We noted no concerns with the carrying value. We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates. The Company is managed by the Keystone JVco Limited group's head office function. All balances within the Company's financial statements have been subject to a full scope audit. _Materiality_ The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.

Due to the current capital structure of the group, we believe an adjusted profit basis is the appropriate benchmark to use in setting materiality. For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was £700,000 and £820,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £55,000 (12 month period ended 31 Mar 2018: £70,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. The key objective of the company is to hold investments in the various group companies. As a result, we believe total assets is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the parent company and is therefore the appropriate benchmark to use in setting materiality.

The Group carries out a detailed annual review of the net realisable value of land held for and under development both relating to plots currently in development, and land and phases of sites not yet in development. Net realisable value for land where construction of homes had commenced at the year end or is anticipated to commence within the next 12 months was assessed by estimating selling prices and costs (including sales and marketing expenses) taking into account current market conditions. Land where house building had not commenced at the year end and was more likely to be sold undeveloped is assessed by reappraising the land using current selling prices and costs for the proposed development and assuming an appropriate financial return to reflect the current housing market conditions and the prevailing financing environment. At the year end, the net realisable value provision amounts to £400,000 (31 March 2018: £900,000). This provision will be closely monitored for adequacy and appropriateness as regards under and over provision to reflect circumstances at future balance sheet dates. Government grants are recognised as deferred income and are allocated to the income statement over the useful lives of the related assets. The effect of this treatment is to reduce the fair value of work in progress by £9,875,000 (31 March 2018: £6,687,000) and to reduce cost of sales in the income statement by £2,011,000 (31 March 2018: £1,281,000).",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This can lead to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. Primarily, for those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from registered providers of housing, revenue will be recognised based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. The majority of the Group’s revenue and profit, including revenue from open market sales, will continue to be recognised on legal completion. 61 ----- ### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Previously, where the Group entered into arrangements to provide housing to registered providers at below open market value in exchange for discounted land from partners, the associated housing unit revenue is recorded at open market value. IFRS 15 does not permit this, as the exchange transaction (land discount from partner) is not received directly from the customer (registered provider) and so does not meet the criteria of non-cash consideration. This will reduce reported revenue. Accordingly, the revenue recognised in respect of these housing units will be equal to the cash consideration received from registered providers, with no open market value adjustment. There are a limited number of developments where the eventual buyer of the affordable units is the same entity as the land vendor.

Previously, where the Group entered into arrangements to provide housing to registered providers at below open market value in exchange for discounted land from partners, the associated housing unit revenue was recorded at open market value. IFRS 15 does not permit this, as the exchange transaction (land discount from partner) is not received directly from the customer (registered provider) and so does not meet the criteria of non-cash consideration, except in the case when the land vendor and buyer of affordable units are the same. Accordingly, the revenue recognised in respect of these housing units will be equal to the cash consideration received from registered providers, with no open market value adjustment. [2] Under IFRS 15, revenue recognised prior to the date on which it is invoiced to the customer is recognised as a contract asset. This balance was previously recognised within trade receivables and has so been reclassified. There was no impact on the income statement as a result of these reclassifications. [3] For registered provider sales there is a timing difference between payment for the houses and when control passes to the customer. A contract liability has been recognised for this amount, that was previously recognised within accruals and deferred income. There was no impact on the income statement as a result of these reclassifications. [4] Prior to the Group adopting IFRS 15 revenue from registered providers was recognised on legal completion. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This leads to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. Primarily, for those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from registered providers of housing, revenue will be recognised based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. The impact would be to recognise revenue earlier and the impact is shown above. The balance sheet impact of this is to decrease contract liabilities and increase contract assets. At the same time this adjustment reduces the value of inventories as cost of sales increases as revenue is recognised earlier. [5] Prior to the introduction of IFRS 15 a land commitment creditor was recognised for the fair value of housing due to registered providers. Going forward, following the change discussed in [1] above, the Group will only recognise a development land payable balance when the land vendor and buyer of affordable units are the same. The effect will be to reduce development land payables and land held for and under development by the same amount.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Our success in refining our approach to health and safety in that role throughout the 2017/18 financial year earned us a RoSPA Gold Award for 2017. That accolade recognises a very high level of performance, demonstrating well-developed occupational health and safety management systems and culture, outstanding control of risk and very low levels of error, harm and loss. RoSPA’s recognition does not mean the job is done. We refocused our Safety, Health, Environment and Quality (SHEQ) strategy at the end of 2017 on three core areas: - Keeping people safe and healthy every day - Protecting and enhancing the environment - Being assured, informed and focussed on quality Early progress has been made in these areas: - Active and visible leadership is being provided from the top of the Group. Our senior managers not only set an example of appropriate behaviour on site, but ensure that the Group’s expectations set a framework within which a safe culture can become embedded. - Clear and robust performance standards have been developed for five high-risk activities. We are enforcing safe working practices around plant and work at height. Our people are conscious of additional risks when assembling timber frame structures. And we have been successful in reducing incidents of underground services being struck. - A new approach to inductions is ensuring that everyone on site is fully engaged in our health and safety programme. An online training programme and test establish 100% understanding before new employees or contractors step onto site. - An integrated approach to risk management is being taken that includes all stakeholders throughout all phases of a contract. We seek to design out risk at an early stage and ensure that sound technical decisions are not lost later in the process. - We have ensured that our contractors have Risk Assessment and Method Statements in place, but our focus is now turning to outcomes. We want to see that those statements have been adequately communicated, comprehended and complied with. Whilst our safety performance is significantly better than our peers within the HBF, the rate of improvement has stabilised and we are committed to driving continual improvement across all aspects of health and safety. As the 2018/19 financial year starts, we are rolling out new systems and standards. Onsite inspections will use contemporary software to record richer data, giving us improved management information and better understanding of incident data and trends. Our ‘fit for work’ programme will set a new occupational health framework comprising information and health surveillance advice for both employees and contractors before, during and after their time on site. Having established a SHEQ Leadership and Review Process as part of our SHEQ governance arrangements, it is our intent to review performance throughout all levels of the organisation on a regular basis, always with the aim to improve our performance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

These risks are monitored and managed through robust policies and procedures. Further details are included in Note 25 of the financial statements. Liquidity risk relates to the Group generating sufficient cash flow to meet its operational requirements while avoiding debt covenant breaches or excessive debt levels. Total borrowings are a combination of long term loans and long term committed revolving working capital credit facilities. Credit risk is in relation to trade receivables from customers. Given that the majority of trade receivables are with public and regulated organisations, the exposure to credit risk is extremely limited. Interest rate risk relates to the impact of interest rate increases on the Group’s floating rate borrowings.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,156,OVERVIEW,156.61,Our audit approach,156.61.1,Key audit matter_** **_How our audit addressed the key audit matter,"_Carrying value of land and work in progress_ We focused upon this area because the value of the Group's land and work in progress represent a significant proportion of assets in the Group statement of financial position and determining the carrying value of land and work in progress requires a high degree of judgement. The key judgements include forecasting future costs to complete which can be affected by market conditions and unexpected events. _Presentation of exceptional items_ We focused on this area because there is an element of judgement involved in identifying exceptional items for presentation as such in the Group financial statements. _Accounting for and disclosure of Regeneration division disposal_ We focused on this area given the financial significance of the Regeneration division to the Group before its disposal, and due to the large and one-off nature of the transaction. We assessed the adequacy of controls over site valuations, including costs to complete, site budget approvals, and the authorisation and recording of costs, including testing of controls over the allocation of costs to the correct sites. We visited a sample of sites to confirm the existence and condition of the work in progress, and also to evaluate the reasonableness of the assessment of stage of completion. We performed a 'bottom up' alternative work in progress assessment across a number of sites, to assess the accuracy of standard costing. We sample tested and agreed certain costs incurred during the year included within land and work in progress to supporting evidence as well as reviewing the proportion of that expenditure recognised as a cost of sale in the year in respect of units sold. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s forecasting of site development profit against those recorded previously. We discussed a sample of sites with central and regional management in order to assess the reasonableness of net realisable values and corroborated the explanations received back to supporting documentation where appropriate. We performed an assessment of land and build provisions via enquiry and corroboration to supporting evidence. We tested the reconciliations from the site cashflows to the accounting system. We sample tested and agreed certain costs incurred to supporting documentation. We assessed whether, in our view, the costs presented as exceptional items met the definition as such. We reviewed the final disposal agreement and determined whether the gain on disposal was accurately calculated and accounted for appropriately. We also evaluated whether the disclosures included within the Group financial statements are in line with applicable accounting standards. ----- ### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited _How we tailored the audit scope_ We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates. Following the disposal of the Regeneration division on 30 April 2017, for the majority of the financial year the Group has operated as a single Homes division. The Homes division consists of two statutory entities which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information due to their size. There are also a number of other group entities that contain financially significant balances which, in our view, required an audit of these specific financial statement line items. Specific audit procedures over exceptional items, administrative expenses, finance expenses, borrowings, and provisions were performed across these other components. The components over which we performed audit work represent all of the Group's revenue from continuing operations and substantially all of the Group's operating profit. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. All work was performed by the Group audit team. _Materiality_ The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall group materiality_** £1,400,000 (2017: £2,400,000). How we determined it_** 5% of of profit before tax from continuing activities, adjusted for interest on senior secured loan notes, exceptional items and amortisation of assets acquired on acquisitions. _Carrying value of investments and intercompany receivables_ We focused upon this area because the underlying value in the Company is represented by balances due from the wider group and the investment held by the Company in its subsidiaries. The key judgement is the underlying cash generation and profitability of the wider group which can be affected by market conditions and unexpected events. Following the disposal of the Regeneration division significant dividends have flowed through the Group. _How we tailored the audit scope_ We assessed the adequacy of controls over the forecasting of the group and underlying controls over site valuations, including costs to complete, site budget approvals, and the authorisation and recording of costs, including testing of controls over the allocation of costs to the correct sites. We assessed the accuracy of management’s forecasting of site development profit against actual profits recorded. We performed sensitivity analysis over the forecasts of the group, specifically a decline in EBITDA (focusing on a downturn in revenue and increase in build costs) and increase in discount rate. We noted no concerns with the carrying value. We assessed the dividends received and paid by the Company specifically the ability for dividends to be paid and the supporting documentation approving the amounts. We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates. The Company is managed by the Keystone Midco Limited group's head office function. All balances within the Company's financial statements have been subject to a full scope audit. _Materiality_ The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall materiality_** £300,000 (2017: £2,160,000). How we determined it_** 2% of total assets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,156,OVERVIEW,156.61,Our audit approach,156.61.2,Rationale for benchmark applied,"The key objective of the Group is to deliver profitable growth to increase long-term shareholder value. Due to the current capital structure of the Group, we believe an adjusted profit basis is the appropriate benchmark to use in setting materiality. For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was £1,000,000 and £1,260,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £70,000 (2017: £115,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. The key objective of the parent company is to hold investments in the various group companies. As a result, we believe total assets is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the parent company and is therefore the appropriate benchmark to use in setting materiality. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £15,000 (2017: £108,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 64 ----- ### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited - Company",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,156,OVERVIEW,156.91,Adoption of new and revised standards,156.91.1,IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers,"In May 2014, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ was issued, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.  For the Group, transition to IFRS 15 will take place on 1 April 2018. IFRS 15 sets out the requirements for recognising revenue from contracts with customers. The standard uses a five-step model to apportion revenue to the individual performance obligations within a contact. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This can lead to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. Primarily, for those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from registered providers of housing, revenue will be recognised based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. The majority of the Group’s revenue and profit, including revenue from open market sales, will continue to be recognised on legal completion. 28 ----- ### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the year ended 31 March 2018 Management has modelled the impact on revenue and gross profit for the financial year ended 31 March 2018 and determined that the impact would have been to reduce revenue by approximately £3.5m, the impact on gross profit would have been immaterial. The standard also sets out the requirements for recognition of non-cash consideration as revenue.  Currently, where the Group enters into arrangements to provide housing to registered providers at below open market value in exchange for discounted land from partners, the associated housing unit revenue is recorded at open market value. IFRS 15 does not permit this, as the exchange transition (land discount from partner) is not received directly from the customer (registered provider) and so does not meet the criteria of non-cash consideration. Accordingly, the revenue recognised in respect of these housing units will be equal to the cash consideration received from registered providers, with no market value adjustment. The land discount will be accounted for in a similar manner to a Government grant, with the gross up in land WIP value entirely adjusted through cost of sales rather than revenue.  This will reduce reported revenue but will have no impact on reported gross profit. If this accounting policy had been applied during the year ended March 2019, reported revenue and cost of sales would both have been reduced by £25.3m.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

None of these revised standards and interpretations have been adopted early by the Group. - IAS 27 (Amended) - Separate financial statements - IAS 28 (Amended) - Investments in associates and joint ventures - IAS 40 (Amended) – Investment property - IFRS 7 (Amended) - Financial instruments: Disclosures - IFRS 9 (Amended) - Financial instruments - IFRS 15 (Amended) - Revenue from contracts with customers - IFRS 16 (Amended) - Leases With the exception of those mentioned below, the directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have a material effect on the financial position or performance of the Group and Company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

The standard sets out principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. The standard is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. The Group will not early adopt the standard. IFRS 16 removes the long-standing distinction between finance leases and operating leases and introduces a single lessee accounting model, with some limited exemptions for short-term leases of less than 12 months and leases of low-value assets, based on a ‘right to use’ principle. The Group is in the process of quantifying the implications of the new standard, but expects the following impacts: - There is expected to be an increase in total assets, as leased assets, currently accounted for off balance sheet (i.e. classed as operating leases under IAS 17) will be recognised on balance sheet. The biggest asset category impacted for the Group is expected to be land and buildings. - There is expected to be an increase in debt, as liabilities relating to operating leases are recognised. - Operating lease expenditure will be reclassified and split between depreciation and finance costs. Therefore EBITDA will increase.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,156,OVERVIEW,156.93,Basis of consolidation,156.93.1,,"The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Keystone Midco Limited, its subsidiary undertakings and the Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates. (a) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed in administrative costs as incurred. All identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and contingent liabilities assumed are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest as compared with the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets are recognised as goodwill. Where the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the total consideration transferred, a gain from a bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the income statement after the fair values initially determined have been reassessed. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with accounting policies adopted by the Group. 29 ----- ### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the year ended 31 March 2018 (b) Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, interest in joint ventures is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income. Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds its equity accounted investment in a joint venture, the carrying amount of the equity interest is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations. Appropriate adjustment is made to the results of joint ventures where material differences exist between a joint venture’s accounting policies and those of the Group. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of the impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in the income statement adjacent to its share of profit/(loss) from associates. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. (c) Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method, applying the same policy as set out for joint ventures above.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

This condition is regarded as met only when the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups) and the sale is highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,156,OVERVIEW,156.96,Revenue and profit recognition,156.96.1,,"Revenue and profit are recognised as follows: _Private house building, property development and land sales_ Revenue and profits on these activities are included in the financial statements on legal completion. Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable upon legal completion. Open market sale plots are recognised at the agreed sales price deemed to be fair value, whilst sales to registered providers are recognised at the fair value of the sale. _Construction contracts_ Revenue on construction contracts represents the fair value of work done and excludes value added tax and trade discounts. Once the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, margin is recognised in the income statement on a stage of contract completion basis by reference to management’s estimate of total forecast value less total forecast costs based on the proportion of total costs incurred to date on the contract as a whole. Provision is made in full for any potential loss on construction contracts as soon as such losses become apparent. Claims on customers or third parties for variations to the original contract are recognised in the income statement once entitlement to the claim has been established. Claims by customers or third parties in respect of work carried out are recognised in the income statement once the obligation to transfer economic benefit has become probable. 30 ----- ### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the year ended 31 March 2018 On the balance sheet, the Group reports the net contract position for each contract as either an asset or a liability.

It is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is a triggering event, by considering the net present value of future cash flows. For the purposes of testing for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement. Where the fair value of the consideration given is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired, the difference is immediately recognised in the income statement as a gain from a bargain purchase.

Where current tax losses are available but not utilised in the period, a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is considered recoverable. Taxable profit differs from that reported in the income statement because it is adjusted for items of income or expense that are assessable or deductible in other years, or are never assessable or deductible. Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax rates used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised in full if future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised. The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. - **Goodwill and intangible assets IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired tangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value such intangible assets require the use of estimates. Future results are impacted by the length of amortisation periods adopted, and changes to the estimated useful lives which would result in different effects on the income statement and balance sheet. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, along with finite life intangible assets and other assets of the Group’s cash generating units. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions (including discount rates, timing of cash flows and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective. - **Fair value on land acquired at a discount to market value Where the Group enters into specific arrangements with partners who provide discounted land in return for the provision of social housing, the fair value of the housing units provided, which equates to the open market value of the discount to land, is reflected in the financial statements. Land value in the balance sheet is therefore reflected at its fair value with this fair value being released to revenue and cost of sales as the land is sold. - **Estimation of costs to complete, work in progress and contract provisions In order to determine the profit and loss that the Group is able to recognise on its developments in a specific period, the Group has to allocate total costs to the developments between the proportion completing in the period and the proportion to complete in a future period. The assessment of total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation. However, Group management has established internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made on an individual site basis. 34 ----- ### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Company’s management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.

In testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the recoverable amount has been determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the forecast revenue and profit, discount rates and long-term growth rates by market sector. Future forecast revenue is based on management’s knowledge of actual results from prior years and latest forecasts for the current year, along with secured works, management’s expectation of the future level of work available within the market sector and expected changes in selling volumes and prices for completed houses. In establishing future profit margins, the margins currently being achieved are considered in conjunction with expected inflation rates in each cost category and the current market value of land being acquired. Cash flows beyond the five year plan period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% (2017: 2%) per annum. The growth rate used is the Group’s estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the market sectors in which the Group operates. A pre-tax discount rate of 10.5% (2017: 11.0%) has been applied, being the estimated weighted average cost of capital of the Group. The Group applied sensitivities to the assumptions used in the cash flows noted above and the sensitivities resulted in headroom which was materially above the carrying value. 45 ----- ### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

Net realisable value for land where construction of homes had commenced at the year end or is anticipated to commence within the next 12 months was assessed by estimating selling prices and costs (including sales and marketing expenses) taking into account current market conditions. Land where house building had not commenced at the year end and was more likely to be sold undeveloped is assessed by reappraising the land using current selling prices and costs for the proposed development and assuming an appropriate financial return to reflect the current housing market conditions and the prevailing financing environment. At the year end, the net realisable value provision amounts to £0.9m (2017: £1.0m). This provision will be closely monitored for adequacy and appropriateness as regards under and over provision to reflect circumstances at future balance sheet dates. Government grants are recognised as deferred income and are allocated to the income statement over the useful lives of the related assets. The effect of this treatment is to reduce the fair value of work in progress by £6,687,000 (2017: £4,497,000) and to reduce cost of sales in the income statement by £1,281,000 (2017: £2,447,000). 48 ----- ### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited for housebuilding activities as the Group typically receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales. The credit risk on registered provider sales depends on the individual characteristics of the counterparty many of whom are in the public sector or are funded by the public sector (e.g. housing associations). The Board consider that the credit rating of these customers is good and the credit risk on outstanding balances to be low. The Group does not have any concentration of risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract receivables or trade receivable balances, with receivables spread across a wide range of customers.

An ageing profile of the Group’s loans and borrowings is presented in note 18. The Group’s objective is to manage liquidity by ensuring that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they become due. This will be assessed under normal and stress conditions, without incurring losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. Following the partial redemption of the senior secured notes, the Group’s primary source of capital is £100m 9.5% Senior Secured Notes due for repayment in 2019. Short term liquidity is managed through the use of committed bank facilities and cash. See note 18 for maturity analysis of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities. The Group has rigorous cash management processes. Cash balances are reported daily with detailed analysis of variances to short term cash forecasts. Short term cash forecasts are updated monthly and are for a period of 26 weeks with the first 8 weeks on a daily basis and the remaining 18 weeks on a weekly basis. These complement a minimum of four long term quarterly cash forecasts each year which are compared to the annual cash flow budget and to previous quarterly forecasts. These facilitate management’s assessments of the Group’s expected cash performance and to compare to the facilities available and the Group’s covenants. 57 ----- ### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018",N/A,as_expected,2021,681

In order to mitigate this risk the Group continually monitors open market house sales volumes and prices; working capital levels and contract profitability and reviews client and supplier credit references and credit terms with clients and suppliers to ensure they continue to be appropriate.

The committed bank facilities are at floating interest rates at a margin over the London Interbank Borrowing Rate (LIBOR) and management continually keeps this exposure under review. At 31 March 2018, 68% (2017: 89%) of the Group’s borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest. _Housing market risk_ The Group is affected by price fluctuations of the UK housing market. The market is impacted by consumer demand and employment levels and is dependent on the availability of mortgage finance. Furthermore, Government incentives, such as the “Help to Buy” scheme, have helped to stimulate consumer demand. Whilst these risks are beyond the Group’s ultimate control, risk is spread across differing business activities undertaken by the Group and the geographical regions in which it operates. _Currency risk_ The Group operates entirely in the United Kingdom and all of the Group’s revenue is generated in the United Kingdom and is denominated in pounds sterling.

1789,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,156,OVERVIEW,156.280,,156.280.1,,"The last 12 months have been a transformational period for Keepmoat Homes. In the year to 31 March 2018 we delivered 3,717 much needed high quality new homes, 793 more than the year before, and we saw an increase in our revenues of 31.3% to £555.6m. Our new financial year has started well. We are planning to build over 4,000 homes this year and are looking to continue to build on that growth with our partners in the years to come. The disposal of Keepmoat’s Regeneration division to energy and services group ENGIE, completed successfully on 30 April 2017. Keepmoat Homes is now focused entirely on delivering the new homes the UK needs and remaining the UK’s leading partnership homebuilder. Keepmoat is the UK’s largest and only dedicated partnership homebuilder and we are committed to maintaining that position and increasing the number of homes we deliver. We have a presence in all the top 10 markets outside London. Our partners include Homes England with whom we have delivered 11,300 new homes under DPP1, DPP2 and other initiatives with a gross development value of £1.3bn. We also work in strong and enduring partnerships with local authorities and registered providers, with many of those relationships being 5 to 10 years, or in some cases over 20 years, in duration. These relationships are extremely important to us and through our business model we create both financial and socio-economic benefits for our partners, not least through the delivery and acceleration of much needed new homes across the UK. Keepmoat has been the largest partner of Homes England (previously the Homes and Communities Agency) as a member of successive Development Partner Panels. Since 2009, Keepmoat has accessed over £177m in funding initiatives to accelerate output delivery. We have used the Home Building Fund to accelerate the delivery of 2,200 homes and Help to Buy to support the ambitions of 70% of our homebuyers. Keepmoat’s customer base is at the core of the UK housing need, with Keepmoat Homes continuing to be the leading homebuilder of quality homes for first time buyers, at prices people can afford. Last year we built 2,555 homes for open market sale, with 69% being built for the very important first time buyer market and with 51% of our buyers under the age of 35. The market for new affordable homes remains strong in all of our markets, supported by the availability of suitable mortgage products that make it more affordable to buy than rent. It is also helped by the ongoing support for Help to Buy and we are expecting this to be continued, albeit we expect to see some reforms. Government commitment to new housing also remains strong and has significant cross party support. Keepmoat Homes is committed to a multi-tenure strategy with registered providers and the private rented sector (PRS). We sold 1,162 homes to registered providers and the build-to-rent market (or PRS) in the last financial year (31% of our total homes built) and this underpins our multi-tenure strategy. This includes 20 homes delivered for our partner Sigma and its PRS Real Estate Investment Trust (The PRS REIT plc), and we have a number of other sites under active consideration. These markets are important to us as our partners increasingly want to see multi-tenure development. In addition, as part of a balanced blend, they can help drive our financial performance by delivering additional volume and improving our return on capital which is already one of the highest amongst our peers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,681
