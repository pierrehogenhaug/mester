**UK MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties, as defined
in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the
FCA Handbook Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance
**Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting**
or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The securities described in the attached offering memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA.
For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”) II, (ii) a customer within the meaning of
Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not


-----

qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, or (iii) not a qualified investor
as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The attached offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of securities in any Member
State of the EEA that is subject to the Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities.

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors**

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as
amended, the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (as amended,
the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

The attached offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in the UK will
be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (as amended, the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers
of securities. The attached offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION—DATED OCTOBER 4, 2021**
**CONFIDENTIAL**
**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM**

### Maison FinCo plc

**£275,000,000      % Senior Secured Notes due 2027**
_Guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Maison BidCo Limited_


**NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**

**IN THE UNITED STATES**


Maison FinCo plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the “Issuer”), is hereby offering £275.0 million aggregate principal amount of its      % Senior Secured Notes due 2027
(the “Notes”). The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Maison BidCo Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the “Company”). The Notes will be issued pursuant
to an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated on or around          , 2021 (the “Issue Date”). The offering of the Notes is referred to herein as the “Offering.” The gross proceeds of the Offering will be on-lent to
the Company. In turn, the Company will use the proceeds therefrom, together with certain equity contributions, to finance the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of Keystone TopCo Limited (the “Target”), including the
repayment of the Existing Target Indebtedness (as defined herein) (the “Refinancing” and, together with the Acquisition and the Offering, the “Transactions”).
The Notes will bear interest at the rate of      % per annum, payable semi-annually in arrear on           and           of each year, commencing on          , 2022. The Notes will mature on          ,
2027.
At any time on or after          , 2023, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this preliminary offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). Prior
to          , 2023, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to the date of redemption, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may also redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the
original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes (as defined herein)) with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this
Offering Memorandum, if at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes) remains outstanding. Prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may
redeem, during each twelve-month period commencing with the Issue Date, up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued (including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes)
at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. The Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon the
occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law.
Upon the occurrence of certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase all of the outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a change of control will be deemed not to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection
with such event. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”
Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, to the extent the Acquisition will not complete on or shortly after the Issue Date, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will deposit the gross proceeds of the Notes into a
segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) in the name of the Issuer but controlled by the Escrow Agent (as defined herein) pending release to consummate of the Acquisition, and charged on a first-ranking
basis in favor of the Trustee (as defined herein) on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that the funds required to pay
the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any event within three Business Days). The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among
others, certain regulatory approvals and the performance of certain closing actions. If the conditions to the release of the escrow proceeds have not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined
herein) or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price of the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price
of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding such special mandatory redemption date.
The Notes will be general senior secured obligations of the Issuer, and on the Issue Date, will initially be guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Issue Date Guarantee”) by the Company. Subject to and in accordance with
the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements, the Notes and the Issue Date Guarantee will be secured on a first priority basis on the Issue Date by (i) a charge over all
of the shares in the Company on a third party limited recourse basis granted by Maison Hold Limited (“Holdco”); (ii) an assignment over structural intercompany receivables owing by the Company to Holdco; (iii) a
charge over all of the shares in the Issuer granted by the Company; (iv) an English law debenture granted by the Company with respect to its material bank accounts and a floating charge over all or substantially all of its
assets; and (v) an English law debenture granted by the Issuer with respect to its material bank accounts and any structural intercompany receivables owed to it by the Company and a floating charge over all or substantially
all of its assets (collectively, the “Issue Date Collateral”). Within 150 days of the Completion Date (the “Post-Closing Date”), the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Post-Closing Guarantees” and,
together with the Issue Date Guarantees, the “Notes **Guarantees”) by each of Keepmoat Limited, Keepmoat Homes Limited and M.C.I. Developments Limited (the “Post-Closing Guarantors” and, each of them, a**
“Post-Closing Guarantor” and, together with the Company, the “Guarantors”). Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements, within
10 Business Days of the Completion Date, the Notes or the Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first priority basis by a charge over all of the shares in the Target granted by the Company and an assignment over any
structural intercompany receivables owing by the Target to the Company, and on or about the Post-Closing Date, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first priority basis by (i) a charge over all of the
shares in Keepmoat Homes Limited granted by Keepmoat Limited; (ii) a charge over all of the shares in M.C.I. Developments Limited granted by Keepmoat Homes Limited; and (iii) an English law debenture granted
by each Post-Closing Guarantor over its material bank accounts and any structural intercompany receivables owed to it and a floating charge over all or substantially all of its assets in each case, subject to customary
limitations and exceptions (collectively, the “Post-Closing Collateral” and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”). See “Description of the Notes—Security” and “Description of the Notes—Notes
_Guarantees.”_
The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes or the Notes Guarantees, as applicable, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (as defined herein), and will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of the existing and future indebtedness
of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by property or assets that do not also secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees or that are secured by a first priority fixed charge on property or assets that secure the Notes
by way of a floating charge, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness
and other liabilities of subsidiaries of the Company that do not provide Guarantees. The Notes Guarantees may be released in certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure,”
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral
will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”
The property and assets that will secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees thereof will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility on a first-ranking and pari passu basis. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined herein), in the event of a distressed disposal of, or an enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture to be secured in priority to the Notes have been repaid in full. The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees
and the security interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.” The Collateral and the Notes Guarantees may be released in certain circumstances._
There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official
List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be
maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended.

**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 31.**

**Issue Price for the Notes:      % plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.**

**The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “US Securities Act”), or the laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not**
**be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the US Securities Act. In the United States, the Offering**
**is being made only to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) within the meaning of Rule 144A (“Rule 144A”) under the US Securities Act in compliance with Rule 144A under the US Securities Act. You are**
**hereby notified that the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from certain provisions of the US Securities Act provided by Rule 144A thereunder. Outside the**
**United States, the Offering is being made in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S”) under the US Securities Act. For additional information about eligible offerees and transfer**
**restrictions, see “Notice to Investors.”**
The Notes will initially be issued in the form of global notes in registered form. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.” We expect the Notes to be delivered to investors in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV
(“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”), on or about          , 2021 (the “Issue Date”).

exchange for the global notes only as set forth in the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

There is currently no market for the Notes. Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of

Exchange, that permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained, and
settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. Any investor or potential investor in the
European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or in the United Kingdom should not base any investment decision relating
to the Notes on the information contained in this Offering Memorandum after publication of the listing particulars

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors**

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the
markets in which we operate and compete. Unless otherwise indicated, we have generally obtained all information
regarding market, market size, growth rate, development, trends and competitive position and other industry data
pertaining to our business contained in this Offering Memorandum from industry publications, surveys or studies
conducted by third-party sources, as well as internal surveys and estimates and publicly available information.

Some of the information herein has also been extrapolated from market data, reports, surveys and studies
using our experience and internal estimates. Elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, statements regarding the
industry in which we operate, our position in this industry, the size of certain markets are based solely on our
experience, internal studies, estimates and surveys, and our own investigation of market conditions. We believe
that the sources of such information in this Offering Memorandum are reliable, but there can be no assurance that

vi


-----

any of these assumptions is accurate or correctly reflects our position in our industry, and none of our internal
surveys or information has been verified by any independent sources.

Industry and consultant publications and forecasts generally state that the information they contain has
been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is
not guaranteed. While we believe that each of the studies and publications we have used is reliable, neither we
nor the Initial Purchasers have independently verified the data that were extracted or derived from these industry
and consultant publications or reports and cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness. Market data and
statistics are inherently uncertain and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are
based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and
the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the
relevant market.

In addition, market data and statistics are often based on various assumptions. We cannot assure you that
any of these assumptions are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry, and none of our internal
surveys or information have or has been verified by any independent sources. While we are not aware of any
misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such data involve risks and uncertainties
and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under “Risk Factors.” As far as we
are aware and have been able to ascertain from information published by such third parties, no facts have been
omitted that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information in this Offering
Memorandum.

**TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES**

We own or have rights to certain trademarks or trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation
of our businesses. Each trademark or trade name of any other company appearing in this Offering Memorandum
belongs to its holder. We own and have the right to use the trade names “Keepmoat,” “Keepmoat Homes” and the
Keepmoat Homes logo among others. Solely for convenience, the trademarks, trade names and copyrights referred
to in this Offering Memorandum are often listed without the TM and [©] symbols, but we will assert, to the fullest
extent under applicable law, our rights to these trademarks and trade names.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

laws of certain applicable jurisdictions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, all

economy, brought about by uncertainty, loss of consumer confidence, higher interest rates,

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**The Issuer and the Company**

The Issuer is a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales on
September 7, 2021 for the purpose of issuing the Notes offered hereby and is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company. The Issuer conducts no business operations of its own and, as of the Issue Date, will have no
material assets and its only material liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness (including its obligations under
the Notes) and, as of the Completion Date, its only material assets will be its rights and claims under the Proceeds
Loan. The Issuer has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its formation and the issuance of the
Notes.

The Company was incorporated on July 23, 2021 for the purposes of facilitating the Transactions. As of
the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Company has no material assets or liabilities, does not have any
revenue generating activities of its own and has not engaged in actions other than those related to its incorporation
and in preparation of the Transactions. As a result, no historical information of the Company is included in this
Offering Memorandum.

The Target has not prepared consolidated financial information and operates its business through
Keystone Midco Limited and its subsidiaries. Because of the limited historical financial information available for
the Issuer, the Company and the Target, unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this
Offering Memorandum is the historical consolidated financial information of the KM Group, which is generally
representative of the financial information of the Group. See “—Differences Between the Financial Statements of
_the Target and the KM Group.”_

Keystone Midco Limited was formed under the laws of England and Wales on May 21, 2014. For more
information about our corporate structure, see “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure,” “Our Business”
and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**Differences Between the Financial Statements of the Target and the KM Group**

The Target has not prepared consolidated financial information and operates its business through the KM
Group. The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the KM Group, unless
otherwise indicated. As of and for the nine months ended July 31, 2021, the total operating revenue, operating
profit, total assets and total (current and non-current) liabilities of the Target represented 100%, 47%, 100% and
102% of that of the KM Group, respectively.

**_Administrative Expenses_**

The consolidated administrative expenses of the Target were £96.9 million for the nine months ended
July 31, 2021, whereas the administrative expenses of the KM Group were £89.8 million for the same period. The
Target’s consolidated income statement includes certain expenses that are recognized and affect cash flows at the
Target consolidated level only, and which are not recognized at the KM Group level because they are not incurred
within the KM Group. These expenses include an exit related Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) charge of £6.9
million which has been classified as exceptional. The Target operates an exit related LTIP, open to our executive
directors and senior management with awards being made at the discretion of the board of directors of the Target.
Awards under the plan are subject to being in service and an increase in the value of the group up to an exit event
occurring.

**_Finance Income and Expense_**

The Target recorded finance income of £1.1 million and finance expense of £20.5 million for the nine
months ended July 31, 2021, whereas the KM Group recorded finance income of £0.5 million and finance expense
of £19.6 million for the same period, respectively. The difference was due to additional interest expense of £0.9
million (in respect of a loan granted by Keystone JVco Limited to the Target in the amount of £7.5 million) and
interest income of £0.6 million (in respect of preference shares issued by Keystone Midco Limited to the Target)
recognized by the Target. The latter transaction is eliminated in the Target consolidation.

x


-----

**_Indebtedness_**

The Target and the KM Group account for liabilities recorded on their respective consolidated statements
of financial position in the same manner. As of July 31, 2021, the KM Group’s external debt for bank loans,
finance leases and loans from others amounted to £178.8 million.

The Target’s external debt of £187.7 million also includes the £7.5 million loan from Keystone JVco
Limited to the Target, with interest accrued thereon of £1.4 million.

**_Consolidated Equity_**

As of July 31, 2021, the consolidated equity of the Target was £9 million less than the consolidated equity
of the KM Group. This was caused by certain differences recorded in the nine months ended July 31, 2021, as
well as in past reporting periods, relating to variances in annual profit/(loss) results between the Target and the
KM Group, including notably the £6.9 million LTIP charge in the nine months ended July 31, 2021 and a £2.0
million LTIP charge in previous periods.

**_Intercompany Receivables and Payables_**

As of July 31, 2021, the Target recognized an intercompany receivable of £8.7 million (primarily
representing a £3.5 million investment in 12% preference shares issued by Keystone Midco Limited and £4.2
million of dividends owed thereon) as well as an intercompany payable of £0.5 million (representing a balance
owed to Keepmoat Limited).

**_Current liabilities_**

As of July 31, 2021, the Target also recognized a share-based payment liability of £7.9 million, an
associated employer tax liability of £1.1 million in respect of the LTIP and accruals of £0.2 million.

**_Deferred taxation_**

The KM Group recognizes a net deferred tax asset of £7.9 million.

Group’s financial year ended on October 31 for the financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020, and on
March 31 for the financial year ended March 31, 2018. In addition, in connection with the change in financial

“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers).”

In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales,
the independent auditor’s reports included in (i) the audited consolidated financial statements as of for the financial
years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020; (ii); the audited consolidated financial statements as of for the seven
months ended October 31, 2018; and (iii) the audited consolidated financial statements as of for the financial year
ended March 31, 2018 each state that they were prepared for and only for the members of Keystone Midco Limited
as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act of 2006 and for no other purpose; and,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, the independent auditor does not accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to anyone other than Keystone Midco Limited and its members as a body for its audit work or
the opinions it has formed, save where expressly agreed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s prior consent in
writing. The independent auditor’s reports for the KM Group for the financial years ended October 31, 2020 and
2019 are included on pages F-58 and F-132, respectively, of this Offering Memorandum. The independent
auditor’s report for the KM Group for the seven months ended October 31, 2018 is included on page F-195 of this
Offering Memorandum. The independent auditor’s report for the KM Group for the financial year ended March
31, 2018 is included on page F-270 of this Offering Memorandum. See “Independent Auditor” for a description
of the reports of the independent auditor of the Company. Investors in the Notes should understand that in making
these statements, the independent auditor confirmed that it does not accept or assume any liability to parties (such
as the purchasers of the Notes) other than to the Keystone Midco Limited and its members as a body with respect
to the report and to the independent auditor’s audit work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting
language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities
registered under the US Securities Act or in a report filed under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “US Exchange Act”). If a US court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting
language, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditor based on its report or
the audited consolidated financial statements to which it relates could be limited.

In addition, we have included in this Offering Memorandum unaudited consolidated financial
information of the KM Group for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, which has been calculated by adding
the unaudited results of operations of the KM Group for the nine months ended July 31, 2021 to the audited results
of operations of the KM Group for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 and then subtracting the unaudited
results of operations of the KM Group for the nine months ended July 31, 2020. The unaudited financial
information for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering
Memorandum, is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for
any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

We have not included financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP in this Offering
Memorandum. As of and for (i) the financial year ended October 31, 2019 and 2020; (ii) the seven months ended
October 31, 2018; and (iii) the financial year ended March 31, 2018, our consolidated financial statements were
prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differs in certain significant respects from US GAAP.

In making an investment decision, you should rely upon your own examination of the terms of the
Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own
professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and US GAAP, and how those
differences could affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Pro Forma Financial Information_**

This Offering Memorandum also includes unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information which
have been adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions (i) on as adjusted cash interest expense as if the
Transactions had been completed on August 1, 2020, and (ii) on as adjusted total debt, as adjusted total senior
secured net debt and as adjusted net debt as if the Transactions had been completed on July 31, 2021. The pro
_forma financial information is for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or to be indicative_
of the consolidated results of operations or financial position we would have reported, had the Transactions been
completed as of (i) August 1, 2020 for the purposes of the calculation of as adjusted cash interest expense and (ii)
July 31, 2021 for purposes of the calculation of as adjusted total debt, as adjusted total senior secured net debt and
as adjusted net debt, nor does such pro forma financial information purport to project as adjusted total debt, as
adjusted total senior secured net debt, as adjusted net debt and as adjusted cash interest expense at any future date.

The _pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are_
reasonable but may differ materially from actual amounts.

**Other Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios, including
Contribution, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Normalized
EBITDA, gross margin, Free Cash Flow, free cash flow conversion, ROCE, tangible net operating asset value,
tangible net asset value, as adjusted total debt, as adjusted total senior secured net debt, as adjusted net debt and
as adjusted cash interest expense (collectively, “Non-IFRS Measures”) that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction.

      - “Contribution” represents gross profit adjusted for exceptional items within cost of sales,
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and acquisition fair value adjustments.

      - “Adjusted EBIT” represents operating profit/(loss) before exceptional items, shareholder
monitoring fees, amortization of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition fair value adjustments
to inventory and impairment losses of investments in associated companies.

      - “Adjusted EBIT margin” represents Adjusted EBIT divided by Group revenue.

      - “Adjusted EBITDA” represents operating profit/(loss) before exceptional items, shareholder
monitoring fees, amortization of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition fair value adjustments
to inventory, impairment losses of investments in associated companies, depreciation,
depreciation of right-of-use assets and amortization of computer software.

      - “Adjusted EBITDA margin” represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by Group revenue.

      - “Normalized EBITDA” for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 has been calculated by
subtracting the Adjusted EBITDA presented in our management accounts for each of the months
ending August 31, September 30 and October 31, 2020 (with certain adjustments as necessary
to present on a basis comparable to the Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31,
2021) (the “October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA”) from the Adjusted EBITDA for
the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and then adding the Adjusted EBITDA presented in our
management accounts for each of the months ending August 31, September 30 and October 31,
2019 (the “October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA”), as further described in footnote
9 under “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other
_Financial Information.” We believe that Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July_
31, 2021 is a measure that assists in understanding our performance during a period impacted
by the market disruption caused by COVID-19 by substituting the October 2020 Management
Adjusted EBITDA for the October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA, comprising the
months of our last calendar equivalent financial quarter prior to the market disruption caused by
COVID-19. Our operations during the three months ended October 31, 2020 were negatively
impacted following the government imposed lockdown and the subsequent delayed ramp up on
home construction and sales, before resuming normalized operations during the three month
period ended January 31, 2021. As a result, we believe Normalized EBITDA is more
representative of our Adjusted EBITDA performance for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021
and takes into account, on a highly illustrative basis, the cyclicality of our business. Normalized
EBITDA presented herein is for informational purposes only. Normalized EBITDA for the
twelve months ended July 31, 2021 might not represent what our Adjusted EBITDA would have
been for the same period had the confinement measures not been implemented. In particular,
Normalized EBITDA does not (i) give effect to any other event, favorable or unfavorable, that
happened or could have happened during the three months ended October 31, 2020, other than
the events directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic or (ii) adjust for the positive or negative
effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the nine months ended July 31, 2021. The
information has been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions as described herein but such
assumptions do not take into account all conceivable variables and are therefore inherently
subject to risks and uncertainties. In addition, such assumptions may not give an accurate or
complete picture of the KM Group’s financial condition or results of operations, may not be
comparable to the KM Group’s consolidated financial statements or the other financial
information included in this Offering Memorandum and undue reliance should not be placed

upon them when evaluating an investment decision. Normalized EBITDA has been prepared
by, and is the responsibility of, the KM Group’s management, and has been prepared solely for
the purposes of this Offering Memorandum. It is not necessarily indicative of our results of
operations for any future period, is not prepared in the ordinary course by the Issuer, has not
been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act,
the Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards.

- “gross margin” represents Contribution divided by Group revenue.

- “Free Cash Flow” represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures and investments.

- “free cash flow conversion” represents Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA.

- “tangible net operating asset value” represents net assets adjusted for goodwill, acquisition
intangible assets, tax, cash, loans and borrowings, lease assets and liabilities and pension
assets/liabilities.

- “Adjusted tangible net asset value” represents tangible net operating asset value less net debt
and net other non-operating items.

- “ROCE,” or return on capital employed, represents the Adjusted EBIT for the relevant twelve
month period divided by the average of the opening and closing tangible net operating asset
value, expressed as a percentage. We believe that ROCE is a meaningful measure of our
profitability and cash generation for individual sites, regions and the business as a whole. We
believe that ROCE is therefore helpful for understanding the performance of our business.

- “as adjusted total debt” represents the total principal amount of debt as if the as if the
Transactions had taken place on July 31, 2021. See “Capitalization.” As adjusted total debt
excludes unamortized fees in respect of Existing Senior Term Facility and obligations of the
KM Group under the Company PIK Loan.

- “as adjusted net debt” represents as adjusted total debt, less the as adjusted cash and cash
equivalents set forth in “Capitalization.” As adjusted net debt excludes unamortized fees in
respect of Existing Senior Term Facility and obligations of the KM Group under the Company
PIK Loan.

- “as adjusted total senior secured net debt” represents the as adjusted total debt of the KM Group
secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral, excluding any liabilities secured by a fixed
charge or mortgage on Collateral subject to a floating charge, less any cash and cash equivalents
as set forth in “Capitalization.” The calculation of as adjusted total senior secured net debt
assumes that the Revolving Credit Facility has not been drawn as of the Issue Date.

- “as adjusted cash interest expense” represents the cash interest expense on as adjusted total debt
as if the Transactions completed as of August 1, 2020. As adjusted cash interest expense
excludes obligations of the KM Group under (i) the Company PIK Loan and (ii) all of our lease
liabilities.

- “Completions” represent the number of new build homes that we have sold over the applicable
period. For private homes this is the number of legal completions during the period. For
Registered Provider homes this represents the equivalent number of units sold, based on the
proportion of work completed under a contract during the period.

- “ASP” represents average selling price.

- “Land pipeline plots” include secured and preferred developer plots. Secured plots means that
land on which we have a contractual right, a conditionally exchanged contract to develop.
Preferred developer plots means that land where we have been selected as the preferred
developer or has won a bidding process, but contracts have not yet been exchanged.

- “Asset Turn” is defined as Group Revenue divided by average opening and closing tangible net
operating asset value.

xiv


-----

      - “Gross Development Profit” represents gross profit adjusted for marketing costs and exceptional
items within cost of sales.

      - “Gross Development Margin” represents Gross Development Profit divided by Group revenue.
Our calculation of Gross Development Margin includes certain projections, estimates and
assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change. Gross Profit Margin
is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to reflect the current returns on
any particular site or for the Group as a whole or the potential returns that could be achieved on
any particular site or the Group as a whole. Our calculation of Gross Development Margin may
not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.

      - “forward order book” represents the aggregate reserved position at any point in time, including
secured positions with Registered Providers as well as private reservations by individuals. Our
forward order book includes (i) plots that are contracted for but homes have yet to be completed
on the lot and (ii) plot reservations for which contracts have yet to be exchanged.

Where presented, unaudited consolidated financial information of the KM Group for the twelve months
ended July 31, 2021 is a Non-IFRS Measure.

We believe that the presentation of Non-IFRS Measures may or could enhance investors understanding
of our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that EBITDA-based
measures are commonly used by investors. Our Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable with similarly titled
measures used by other companies. For example, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA includes certain adjustments which some companies might not include in the definition of “adjusted
EBITDA.” Our Adjusted EBITDA and related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of financial
performance under IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction and should not be considered
substitutes to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measures of performance
derived in accordance with IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction. Our definition of
Normalized EBITDA includes adjustments which we feel are appropriate to reflect the negative impact on our
performance following the market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, though which may not be
appropriate for other companies or industries. Our Non-IFRS Measures have important limitations as analytical
tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as
reported under IFRS. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently from the definition of
“Consolidated EBITDA” under the Indenture. Some limitations of EBITDA-based measures include:

      - they do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

      - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

      - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service
interest or principal payments, on our debts;

      - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and

      - amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and the Non-IFRS Measures do not reflect
any cash requirements for such replacements;

      - they do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations; and

      - other companies in our industry may calculate Non-IFRS Measures such as adjusted EBITDA
differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be
available to us to meet our obligations. Accordingly, you should rely on our IFRS results, as applicable, and use
these Non-IFRS Measures only in a supplemental manner to evaluate our performance. Key performance
indicators and other non-financial operational data included in this Offering Memorandum are not part of our
financial statements and have not been audited. Our use or computation of these indicators may not be comparable
with the use of computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. None of the key

performance indicators or other non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum should be
considered in isolation or as a substitute to any indicator of our operating performance, cash flows or other measure
of performance derived in accordance with IFRS or the accounting measures of other jurisdictions.

Key performance indicators and other non-financial operational data included in this Offering

**Rounding and Interpretation**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in
million or thousand and percentage terms, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of
the data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. In
addition, as a result of such rounding, the totals of certain financial information presented in tabular form may
differ from the information that would have appeared in such totals using the unrounded financial information.
Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated using
the numerical data in the consolidated financial statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable,
and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

In respect of financial data set forth in the main body of this offering memorandum, a dash (“—”)
signifies that the relevant figure is not available, while a zero (“0”) signifies that the relevant figure is available
but has been rounded to zero. By contrast, no such differentiation has been made in respect of the financial data
set forth in the financial information section of this offering memorandum beginning on page F-1. In the financial
information section, zero (“0”) is used to signify both unavailable figures and figures which are either exactly zero
or have been rounded to zero.

**IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers)**

IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) was issued in 2014 and was endorsed by the EU in
2016. IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) establishes a comprehensive framework for determining
whether, how much and when revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including
IAS 18 (Revenue). IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) is effective for annual periods beginning
on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.

We adopted IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) from April 1, 2018 in accordance with
the fully retrospective transitional approach without using the practical expedients for completed contracts or for
modified contracts. We have applied the expedient allowing both non-disclosure of the amount of the transaction
price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, and an explanation of when it expects to recognize that
amount as revenue for all reporting periods presented before the date of initial application.

Under IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), revenue is recognized based on indicators of
control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This can lead to differences in revenue
recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. The majority of our revenue
and profit, including revenue from open market sales, continues to be recognized on legal completion. For those
sites in respect of which stage payments are received from Registered Providers of housing, revenue is recognized
based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion.

IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) also sets out the requirements for recognition of noncash consideration as revenue. Previously, where we entered into arrangements to provide housing to Registered
Providers at below open market value in exchange for discounted land from partners, the associated housing unit
revenue was recorded at open market value. IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) does not permit
this, as the exchange transaction (land discount from partner) is not received directly from the customer (the
Registered Provider) and so does not meet the criteria of non-cash consideration. This change has the impact of
reducing reported revenue. Accordingly, the revenue recognized in respect of these housing units will be equal to
the cash consideration received from Registered Providers, with no open market value adjustment. There are a
limited number of developments where the eventual buyer of the affordable units is the same entity as the land

xvi


-----

vendor. In these instances, the discount received represents non-cash consideration, which continues to be
recognized as revenue.

The financial information presented herein for the financial year ended March 31, 2018 has been derived
from the restated comparative information contained in the audited financial statements for the year ended October
31, 2018 as restated to give effect to IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers).

**IFRS 16 (Leases)**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. On January
13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on November
9, 2017. IFRS 16 (Leases) replaced IAS 17 (Leases) and the related International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee’s and the Standards Interpretation Committee’s interpretations, and results in almost
all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is
eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial
liability to pay lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. IFRS 16 (Leases) is
effective for fiscal years commencing on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted if IFRS 15
(Revenue from Contracts with Customers) has also been applied.

We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) from November 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Under
this approach, comparative information is not restated and the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 is
recognized in retained earnings at the date of initial application. In particular, as a consequence of IFRS 16
(Leases) our total assets and liabilities are expected to increase as the right of use asset associated with leases and
the corresponding liability, which were previously treated as operating leases, are recognized on the balance sheet.
In addition, operating lease expenditure has been reclassified and split between depreciation and finance cost, and
as a result, our EBITDA is expected to increase. Prior to November 1, 2019 we accounted for Leases under IAS
17 (Leases). As a result the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the seven months ended October
31, 2018 and as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 are not directly comparable to our audited financial
statements as of and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019 with respect to the treatment of leases.

IFRS 16 (Leases) was effective for the financial year ended October 31, 2020. The impact of adopting
IFRS 16 (Leases) for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was the recognition of right of use assets of £8.0
million and lease liabilities of £8.6 million on transition in respect of offices, company vehicles, site plant
equipment and show homes. The impact on adjusted EBIT for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was £0.6
million. This information may not be indicative of the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases) on our total
assets, total liabilities and EBITDA for the next financial year or any future period.

**Overview**

We are one of the UK’s oldest and most experienced partnership housebuilders, with “5-Star
Homebuilder” status awarded in 2021. We are focused on creating sustainable communities in places where
people want to live, and we specialize in the delivery of affordable and high quality homes, principally targeted
at first-time buyers. Headquartered in Doncaster, England, we operate across England and Scotland through nine
operating regions. We are a top ten UK housebuilder, measured by the number of homes sold, including delivering
4,035 homes in our financial year ended October 31, 2019.

Unlike traditional housebuilders, our business model is based on partnerships with entities interested in
seeing an increase in supply of homes as well as those with demand for our product. These partners are primarily
land owners (such as Homes England, Local Authorities and private land owners) or Registered Providers, which
include the traditional not-for-profit and the newer for-profit entities that are registered with the Regulator of
Social Housing to provide affordable housing. We engage each of our key stakeholders in residential projects by
establishing, aligning and prioritizing their needs and successfully delivering their objectives. We have built our
reputation by aligning our approach to our partners’ objectives regarding the sourcing, procurement, planning and
delivery of successful, affordable housing developments that create significant social value. We believe that we
are the original partnership-focused housebuilder in the United Kingdom, having worked with over 200 partners
to date, with many of these relationships enduring for over 20 years.

Our partnership model allows us to have a high degree of certainty over our land pipeline, with sufficient
land secured for six years of development based on our future development plans and on 2019 home deliveries,
while also typically allowing us to defer payment until milestones are met. We are also able to minimize
development and planning risks by partnering with land owners through the early stages of a development project.
Coupled with the relatively low land costs for the affordable homes that we target, we are able to operate a capitallight business model relative to traditional housebuilders, and generate relatively strong cash conversion and return
on capital employed (“ROCE”). In the financial year ended October 31, 2019, the last full financial year prior to
the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ROCE was 32.8%.

We focus on developing urban and suburban locations where there is an inherent demand and supply
imbalance for new homes. We aim to meet this demand through our five core standard house type ranges. This
standardization allows efficiency in procuring materials and construction, increased certainty of cost and timing
of delivery, and assists in establishing optimal site layout mix based on demand and our partners’ preferences. We
are continually working with new technologies that underpin and refine our designs.

We are committed to deliver a range of affordable housing, predominantly for open market sale, social
housing and shared ownership – which provides us with a higher degree of market resilience over the long term
due to generally consistent demand from first-time buyers and well-funded Registered Providers. In the financial
year ended October 31, 2020, approximately 74% of our sales were on the open market (which includes sales to
private customers as well as elective sales to Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a
site), with the remaining approximately 26% of our sales comprising sales to Registered Providers that are
contracted at the outset of development of a site, including but not limited to those contracted to satisfy Section
106 obligations. Approximately 87% of our open market sales in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 were
to private sale customers, of which approximately 76% were to first-time buyers (first-time buyers accounted for
76% during the financial year ended October 31, 2019). In the financial year ended October 31, 2020,
approximately 45% of our total sales, including 67% of sales to first time buyers, involved the use of the United
Kingdom government’s (the “Government”) Help to Buy (“HTB”) scheme. We believe that first-time buyers
provide more resilient structural demand than the typically discretionary and cyclical home-mover segment.

opportunities as a result. We believe our financial results in recent quarters demonstrate the resiliency and strength
of our business model.

Our focus on partnerships provides us with an attractive financial model, benefitting from typically lower
land values, attractive (and often deferred) payment terms, the potential for additional elective deals with
Registered Providers (beyond sales in connection with Section 106 affordable housing obligations) and access to
grant funding to optimize returns. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data.”

**Our Strengths**

**_Strong Fundamentals Underpinning the UK Housing Sector, Supported by a Favorable Government Policy_**
**_Environment_**

The supply of housing in the UK market has lagged behind demand and the regions where we operate in
particular are characterized by a structural supply-demand imbalance. The UK Government’s position has
historically been that everyone should have the opportunity to own an affordable, decent home within a sustainable
and mixed community. To this end, support for the housing market and first-time buyers has been a target of
government policy over recent years, starting with the introduction of the National Planning Policy Framework
(“NPPF”) in 2012.

In its 2021 annual budget, the Government reiterated its pledge to increase the number of new homes
built per annum, with the goal of delivering at least one million additional homes through this parliamentary cycle.
Overall, the Government has a target to build 300,000 homes per year through the mid-2020s (as announced in
the Budget 2017), and we expect there to be continued support for the housebuilding sector as the Government
seeks to achieve this target.

The following chart shows the number of homes completed by private sector and public sector funding,
as compared to the Government target of 300,000 per year.

In particular, the first-time buyer market outside of London, our core target market, is aided by a
supportive structural and political backdrop promoting both home ownership and affordable housing, including
through UK central Government funds, loans, grants and subsidies, which assist in both the viability of schemes
and also pace of delivery. As demonstrated by the recently launched “First Homes” program, which offers firsttime buyers a minimum 30% discount on the purchase of a new build home, we expect this segment to continue
to be a key focus area for the UK government in the future. This has contributed to a rise in housebuilding
completions to 178,310 in England in the year ended December 31, 2019, the highest level since 2007. This is,
however, far below the 300,000 per year needed in England as estimated by the UK Government in early 2021
despite the macro-economic uncertainty created by the pandemic. As household formation continues to rise and
the pandemic has reinforced buyer preferences for houses over flats, we have experienced a strong recovery in
2021 to date.


-----

The demand backdrop for housing remains supportive with the continued increase in UK household
formation. The following chart shows the number of homes in the UK since 2011, as of June 29, 2020, with 20212039 data estimates completed by private sector and public sector funding, as compared to the Government target
of 300,000 per year.

_______________

(1) Office for national statistics

While it is not currently known whether the HTB scheme will be extended after 2023, what modifications
to any extensions may be, or if other government support for the sector may be put in place, we believe the
Government will remain focused on supporting those purchasers who form our key customer base. For instance,
when the HTB scheme was modified and extended to March 2023, reforms were implemented to restrict the
scheme to support only first-time buyers from April 1, 2021 onwards and with regional price caps from £186,100
in the North East to £600,000 in London. As our ASP was £162,000 in the year ended October 31, 2019, we
believe this modification will have little to no adverse impact for our business. Our ASP compares favorably for
entry price point customers when compared to our listed peers.

Further, based on our ability to navigate recent changes to the Scottish equivalent of the HTB scheme,
we do not believe that any termination of the HTB scheme would have a material effect on the demand for our
homes in England. In Scotland, the “Affordable New Build Scheme” remains available to larger housebuilders
(including Keepmoat), though it stopped accepting new applications on February 5, 2021. The suspension of new
applications has had no major impact on our performance in the region, which we believe is primarily a result of
our target market dynamics, competitive entry price point and strong reputation as a 5-Star Homebuilder.

**_We Operate in those areas of the UK Housing Market with the Highest Levels of Affordability and Resilience_**

We believe that we are strategically positioned in the most attractive segment of the UK housing market,
from both a demographic and a geographic perspective. Key attractions of this market segment include resilience
in adverse macroeconomic environments, the greatest affordability levels in terms of income/price ratios and one
of the strongest growth rates in historical and forecast volumes. This segment is also conducive to strong
partnerships with land owners such as Homes England and other local authorities, as well as delivery partners,
including Registered Providers, in their role as agents for the implementation of Government housing policies
driven by social objectives.

As a result, we have achieved consistently strong sales rates in recent years, outperforming more broadly
focused housebuilders. From April 2017 to July 2021, Keepmoat has achieved an average open market sales rate
per outlet per week of 0.82, which is above the broader housing sector’s average open market sales rate per outlet
per week of 0.66.


-----

-----

In terms of geographical footprint, we strategically focus on regions with fundamental affordability
underpinned by strong customer demand and high growth rates. Each of these regions is characterized by belowaverage house prices and mortgage payments as a percentage of take home pay for first-time buyers. The average
income to mortgage payment ratio for the regions we operate in is in excess of 4.0x, compared to approximately
2.0x to 2.5x for London and the South East or approximately 3.3x for the UK as a whole. Additionally, in each
region, our ASP is below the regional average, leaving room for price inflation while remaining at the affordable
end of the spectrum.

The following chart compares our ASP with the market average in the respective regions shown below.

Market Sales ASP for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 based on regional sales data. Keepmoat “South” region has been
compared to the UKHPI “South East” region as the most applicable comparator based on locations served.

We have a well-established presence in North England and are expanding our footprint in the Midlands
and Scotland, where these regions are expected to have higher home completion volumes than the UK average in
the medium term. Forecasted growth rates for ASP between 2021 to 2025 are 28.0%. in the North West, 28.0%
in Yorkshire and the Humber, 23.9% in the East Midlands and 23.9% in the West Midlands, compared to an
already strong UK average of 21.5%.

**_Our Partnership Model Carries Inherently Less Risk than the Traditional Housebuilding Model, with High_**
**_Barriers to Entry and Partners that are Structurally Aligned_**

We are one of the UK’s leading dedicated partnership-focused housebuilders with a proven track-record
and a strong reputation of delivering large scale, multi-faceted, residential-led regeneration schemes throughout
England and Scotland. Unlike traditional housebuilders, we primarily develop in collaboration with partners that
have some form of long-term continuing interest (either through ownership or social responsibility) in the relevant
development. We are a partner of land owners such as Homes England and other Local Authorities, as well as
delivery partners, including Registered Providers of affordable housing, strategically catering to structural demand
driven by social objectives and Government housing policies.

Partnership relationships promote effective and capital light land sourcing and site development (often
with deferred payment terms correlated to the pace of site development and unit sales), as well as the ability to
unlock development sites often inaccessible to traditional housebuilders. Unlike the traditional model, the
partnership model offers an attractive financial profile with lower land acquisition costs, favorable (often deferred)
payment terms, cash generative and competitively priced deals with Registered Providers, access to grant funding
and accelerated delivery, enabling us to pursue investments with an attractive ROCE.


-----

The following chart provides an illustration of the lifecycle of a development and key differences in our
model.

_______________

(1) Keepmoat profile based on a sample of sites. Traditional profile based on management’s experience of the UK housebuilding
industry.

Over the past 25 years, we have developed strong relationships with many of the largest land partners in
the UK, which are predominantly public land owners but also include private land owners, and have built a strong
reputation for delivery, quality and place making (i.e., creating thriving, sustainable communities where people
genuinely want to live, work and play). Relationships are maintained at multiple organizational levels, which help
identify future projects and facilitate successful tender processes. This results in a high volume of repeat business
and a strong visibility of the order book. Long-standing partner relationships such as ours are inherently difficult
to replicate for new entrants.

We believe that the partnership model also has a reduced risk profile, as it is fundamentally based on a
structural alignment of objectives among ourselves and our partners, which results in pragmatism and flexibility
when required. As demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, working with our partners, we were able to
agree a deferral of 80% of committed land spend and 97% of forecast uncommitted land spend, without losing
any site investment opportunities as a result.

**_Operating Model with Best-In-Class Processes and Cost Structure_**

We have specialized in offering a standardized product range of family homes as the optimal means of
building affordable and high quality housing units, while minimizing execution risk and improving predictability
of costs as well as improving construction build times. This focus on product standardization is a key
differentiating element of our business model and commercial proposition to our partners, contributing to the
creation of a strong brand.

To facilitate standardization, we typically utilize our five standard house type ranges, catering to the
requirements of private sale, sale to Registered Providers and local authorities, future mobility standards and
Scottish building standards (where applicable), which assist in establishing optimal site layout mix based on
demand and partner’s preferences. Although it varies from year to year, in the financial year ended October 31,
2020, 88% of our homes were built using standardized housing types.

The in-house development process of our portfolio of core standard designs is based on internal feedback
for saleability, buildability, customer feedback and land/commercial optimization, and is a key driver of the
continued operational improvements across the Group that have resulted in enhanced operating margins.


-----

Standardization of house types has enabled us to accurately reflect third party designs (such as heating,
roofs, furniture and kitchens) for space and accessibility standards. These standard details allow us to promote
best practices for quality, safety and precise material scheduling, optimizing waste as a result. Importantly,
standard specifications facilitate forward demand planning, purchase leverage and rebate maximization. It allows
contractors to bid aggressively on our projects as they have greater confidence around deliverability on cost and
on time. The standardization process has also enhanced the quality of our products which, in turn, has increased
customer satisfaction and reduced aftercare costs.

The efficiencies across the supply chain and cost control and optimization have strengthened our ability
to maintain strong margins and provide a partial defense from cost inflation pressures. This is further enhanced
by our disciplined approach through all stages of capital allocation, acquisitions and cost control. Standardization
has also enabled us to continue to maintain a low ASP, providing the potential to benefit from sale price increases
during inflationary periods.

**_Proven Ability to Source Land through a Disciplined Acquisition Process_**

We have implemented a structured and agile land acquisition process, enabling a continued
replenishment of our land pipeline that has contributed to sustained margin improvement over the last few years.
As there is a lag between the securing of land and the ultimate delivery of finished product on that land, we may
see benefit from this focus on land acquisition being realized over time.

We have a controlled and disciplined internal land acquisition approval process, working within defined
control gateways each requiring senior executive and/or Capex Committee approval. Our land approval protocol
involves three stages. The Pre-Bid Capex proposal establishes the nature, suitability and targeted financial returns
(for gross margin and ROCE) of the opportunity. The Capex 1 Proposal includes a review of planning, title and
legal reports, site risks/mitigants and required approvals, with continued focus on delivering in line with the
threshold financial returns. Finally, the Capex 2 proposal is the region’s final proposal to develop the site
(including financial plan) once all legal matters and major approvals are received. We believe this rigorous land
sourcing process, together with sales price optimization, build and sales management and the resulting increasing
mix of higher quality and better procured sites, may all be contributing factors driving continued margin
expansion.

For example, for sites under development that were approved between 2017 and 2019 (excluding the
North West MCI region), average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for each year of approval
range from approximately 22% to 23% by year, whereas for sites either approved since 2020 or within our secured
pipeline and to be approved, average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for each year of
approval or for the “to be approved” category, range from approximately 24% to 25% by year or category. This
is an increase from the average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for sites under development
that were approved in 2016 and pre-2016, for which average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins
are approximately 21% and 18%, respectively.

**_Strong Management Team with Proven Operational Experience_**

We have a strong management team with a proven track record in UK housebuilding, including expertise
in land acquisition, construction, planning, development and partnering with housing associations, local
authorities, and Registered Providers. This has been instrumental in helping us to achieve 5-Star Homebuilder
status in 2021 with a 92.6% customer satisfaction score.

Since the formation of our executive management team in 2018, we have delivered consistent year-onyear revenue growth, Gross Development Margin and EBIT growth (excluding the COVID-impacted financial
year ended October 31, 2020). The team has accomplished this primarily through an increase in scale, improved
operational efficiency and a disciplined land acquisition process spearheaded by the divisional management team
which has extensive knowledge of the selected regions in which we operate.

**_Strong Financial Track Record of Growth and Returns_**

We have a strong track record of growth and increase in profitability in recent years, resulting from the
combination of our geographical expansion process and strong focus on operational improvements and margin
expansion. From the financial year ended March 31, 2015 to the financial year ended October 31, 2019, revenue
grew by a CAGR of 22% and home completions grew from 2,133 to 4,035 (representing a CAGR of 15%), driven


-----

by methodical expansion in established regions and into new regions, including in January 2017 the acquisition
of MCI Developments Limited in the North West, as well as benefiting from ASP increases.

The KM Group’s Adjusted EBIT increased 47.7% from £41.4 million for the financial year ended March
31, 2018 to £61.1 million in the financial year ended October 31, 2019. Inevitably, the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic had a negative impact in the KM Group’s financial performance in 2020. However, illustrating the
strength and resiliency of our business model, we generated revenues of £628.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of
£73.8 million in the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 3.3% and an increase of 18.3%,
respectively, as compared to the financial year ended October 31, 2019.

Concurrently with this growth, we have made significant investments in structure and personnel at both
regional and head office levels, creating a national platform optimally crafted to support our future growth in our
target geographies. Margins have remained stable over this period, proving our ability and further potential to
continue investing and increasing scale.

**Our Strategies**

Our strategy is to maintain and strengthen our position as one of the leading partnerships-focused
housebuilders in the UK, while delivering enhanced margins and returns from our maturing regional platform. To
achieve this goal, we are focused on the following key strategic priorities.

**_High Visibility on Medium Term Revenue Growth, Risk Mitigation Opportunities and Margin Improvement_**

Our current land pipeline reflects a strong level of land security to deliver on the business plan and
continue to drive future growth, providing us with excellent forward visibility. As of July 31, 2021, there were
24,654 plots in our land pipeline, of which approximately 81% were legally secured, meaning that we have a
contractual right to develop or a conditionally exchanged contract. This equates to a land pipeline of six years at
pre-pandemic annual volumes. We intend to continue to leverage our strong land pipeline and high near-term land
visibility to increase delivery volumes.

We currently characterize five of our nine regions (the East Midlands, South Midlands, North West MCI,
Scotland and West Midlands regions) as “growth regions,” and we believe these regions have significant potential
to deliver additional plots within the existing regional management structure as they mature. We will target both
continued growth in volume and margin improvement, as the business delivers on regional management team
investments that have been made in these growth regions and benefits from the continued realization of land
acquired through improved sourcing processes.

Approximately 86% of our land pipeline has agreed deferred land payment terms with our partners. Of
our land pipeline plots that have been legally secured as of July 31, 2021, approximately 37% represents projects
that were not legally completed and there remained conditionality (e.g., planning and groundworks survey) prior
to finalizing the contract. There are further risk mitigation opportunities available to us within our partnership
model such as land payments made by Registered Provider partners, overage agreements, pace and tenure delivery
flexibility and multi-tenure development.

The benefits of these risk mitigation features have been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic,
with our strong relationships with partners providing flexibility to recalibrate land and delivery obligations during
this challenging period. Altogether, we were able to either defer or pay in alignment with plot delivery £58.4
million of £65.5 million total forecast land payments (89%) from April 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020.

**_Continued Development of Our Large and Strong Land Pipeline_**

In addition to building out our strong land pipeline of over 24,000 plots, we intend to continue to pursue
new land opportunities to maintain the secured land pipeline, particularly increasing the amount of higher quality,
better procured sites (reflecting our enhanced requirements and processes prior to approval for an opportunity
being granted). We expect to continue to have a structured, disciplined and agile approach to land acquisitions to
facilitate securing suitable land opportunities across all of our regions, who each have dedicated land acquisition
teams focused on high quality land opportunities within each region’s geographical area of operation.

**_Strengthen Relationships with Key Stakeholders_**

We intend to build on our long-standing relationships with key stakeholders such as Registered Providers,
Local Authorities, and Government agencies, such as Homes England. These relationships have been nurtured


-----

over two decades and are held throughout our organizational structure and that of our partners, from executives
to regional management and staff.

We have a proven track record for delivery, quality and placemaking resulting in winning repeat business.
Going forward, we will continue to align objectives with key partners in areas such as climate and biodiversity
emergency targets, in addition to the growing need for affordable homes. We will also seek to develop new
relationships through our new business teams.

**_Continue to Focus on Delivering Best Services while Maintaining Strong ESG Benefits and H&S Standards_**
**_at our Sites_**

Customer satisfaction is at the heart of our business and we strive to deliver high-quality homes and
customer service, reflected by our 5-star customer status. We intend to continue to focus on ensuring that our
customers are supported throughout their house buying journey, meeting their expectations, and providing them
with a high-quality new home.

Sustainability is core to the partnership business model and we are committed to prioritizing ESG
initiatives. Key stakeholders are aligned in their focus with approximately 74% of Local Authorities in the UK
declaring a climate and biodiversity change emergency, with regeneration areas often more vulnerable to climate
and environmental impacts. We are working with Wildscapes, which is a wildlife trust consultancy, to develop
methodologies to support the delivery of a net gain in biodiversity for future developments. We are responsible
for placemaking and regeneration which in turn helps create direct and indirect employment opportunities within
low-income communities. We are focused on providing affordable, low carbon homes to contribute to delivering
on our and our partners’ objectives of improving the environmental sustainability of the UK’s homes.

We have committed to a number of near term ESG targets, including: introducing science-based carbon
targets aligned to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius along with carbon performance metrics (currently
anticipated to be set in late 2021); setting our decarbonisation roadmap within 12 months from July 2021, with
the aim of achieving a net zero carbon position by the mid-2040s; mitigating supply chain risks and supporting
our supply chain to become more sustainable; and updating our sustainability structure, providing greater
oversight and focus on sustainability with the function reporting directly to the CEO and receiving greater focus
from the Board.

Additionally, we have well-developed and structured H&S policies, certified to ISO 45001:2018, and
training programs, as reflected in our health and safety track record. We have clear policies, best practice guides
and robust standards and operate a number of forward looking and backward looking metrics.

We continuously seek to improve our H&S performance and approach, focusing on risk throughout all
phases of a development. Our strategic objectives are centered around (i) keeping people safe and healthy every
day; (ii) protecting and enhancing the environment; and (iii) being assured and informed. Each of the these
strategic objectives contain a number of initiatives focused on achieving the objectives and cover, amongst other
matters, active and visible leadership; managing risk effectively and proportionately; accountability, behavior and
culture; capability; contemporary management systems; and key performance indicators. As initiatives are
implemented, they are reviewed for effectiveness by our executive EHS committee and monitored.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On August 4, 2021, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Acquisition
**Agreement”) with the Sellers pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed to indirectly acquire**
100% of the share capital of the Target.

Completion of the Acquisition Agreement was conditional on a number of third party consents, all of
which have now been obtained. The Acquisition will be consummated on or about October 27, 2021 (the
“Completion Date.”)

The estimated cash consideration payable by the Company on the Completion Date is approximately
£517.1 million. The estimated cash consideration payable to the Sellers represents the agreed base consideration
payable to the Sellers pursuant to the Acquisition as adjusted for our estimates of an agreed ticker fee accruing
until the Completion Date and certain notified cash leakage items, certain payments arising as a result of the
Transactions and certain other adjustments required under the Acquisition Agreement. See “Use of Proceeds.”


-----

Certain members of management will settle and subsequently reinvest their shares into the Company in lieu of
receiving cash.

The Company will also be liable to: (i) repay the Target Group external debt of approximately
£159.9 million (the precise figure will depend on break fees as of the Completion Date) (the “Existing Target
**Indebtedness”); (ii) procure the repayment by the Target of certain transaction costs of the Sellers and disclosed**
transaction bonuses (net of estimated corporate tax savings)(to the extent that these costs exceed this amount, the
amount of consideration for the Acquisition will be reduced to reflect this increased liability); (iii) repay certain
debt-like items and adjustments to be repaid as part of the Transactions, including intercompany loans and other
similar items; and (iv) pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

The Acquisition will be financed as follows: (i) the Issuer will issue the Notes offered hereby in an
aggregate principal amount of £275.0 million; and (ii) Aermont and certain members of its management will make
an equity contribution in an estimated amount of £476.1 million, which will be downstreamed through a series of
intermediate holding companies to the Company (the “Equity Contribution”). The purchase price for the
Acquisition is subject to customary purchase price adjustments in accordance with the Acquisition Agreement.

The purchase price set forth in the Acquisition Agreement includes a profit ticker component, which is
an agreed daily amount that accrues from and excluding April 30, 2021 to and including the Completion Date. As
a result, the ultimate purchase price under the Acquisition Agreement will also be dependent on the timing of the
Completion Date. In addition, the purchase price for the Acquisition Agreement will be reduced by the amount of
leakages, being actions resulting in the loss of cash or other value from the Target in favor of the Sellers, such as
the payment of any dividends, any other payments or disposals, assignments or transfer of assets or any payments
made pursuant to any guarantee, indemnity or similar obligation, among other things, in each case to the extent
not expressly permitted by the Acquisition Agreement (collectively, the “Leakages”).

**_The Refinancing_**

A portion of the cash proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be used to make the Proceeds Loan in
order to repay substantially all of the Existing Target Indebtedness (which amount excludes accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, prepayment and/or cancellation fees and/or redemption premia) expected to be outstanding on
the estimated Completion Date, assuming the Completion Date occurs on or about October 27, 2021, comprising:
(i) a senior term facility, between, among others, Keystone Bidco Limited as company and original borrower,
certain GSO funds as original lenders, Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch as agent and U.S. Bank
Trustees Limited as security agent (the “Existing Senior Term Facility”); and (ii) the super senior revolving
credit agreement, between, among others, Keystone Bidco Limited as company and original borrower, Barclays
Bank Plc, Lloyds Bank plc and Royal Bank of Canada as original lenders, Lloyds Bank plc as agent and U.S.
Bank Trustees Limited as security agent (the “Existing Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility” and, together
with the Existing Senior Term Facility, the “Existing Debt”).

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer and the Company, as co-borrowers, will enter into the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement which provides for the £70.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. If the amounts of debt
outstanding under our Existing Debt on the Completion Date exceed the amounts set forth above and in the event
that freely available cash on the balance sheet on the Completion Date is lower than our estimate due to, among
other things, a negative movement in working capital, we may draw down amounts under the Revolving Credit
Facility on the Completion Date to fund any shortfall to complete the Transactions.

**_Escrow Account_**

To the extent the Acquisition will not complete on or shortly after the Issue Date, pending the
consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the Offering of the
Notes into the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer on the Issue Date. The Escrow Account will be controlled
by the Escrow Agent and will be charged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders
of the Notes. See “Summary—The Offering—Collateral.”

The release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Accounts is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly
(and in any event within three Business Days). See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption.” If these conditions are not satisfied on or prior to December 31, 2021 (the “Escrow_
**Longstop Date”) or upon the occurrence** of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”). The special mandatory redemption price for the Notes will


-----

be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow
_of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—_ _If the_
_conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to_
_redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account will not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without relying_
_on an additional equity investment from the shareholders.”_

**Recent Developments**

**_COVID-19_**

Our financial performance during the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was affected significantly
by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of program disruption and the costs of operating with COVID-19 working
practices and social-distancing measures, our delivery volumes declined significantly given construction activity
was significantly stalled from April through August 2020, our margins declined slightly compared to the financial
year ended October 31, 2019 and our EBIT and ROCE performance eroded significantly.

However, as demonstrated by our performance for the nine months ended July 31, 2021 and our forward
order book, we recovered strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic by the first quarter of our fiscal year 2021 and
believe that we are well positioned to deliver on our planned growth in the medium term. We have benefitted from
a robust UK housing market, with a favorable mortgage environment, ongoing government support and strong
demand, against the resilient economic backdrop during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the strict lockdown measures that were imposed through April 2021, for the twelve months ended
July 31, 2021, our Adjusted EBIT and ROCE increased 12.8% and 150 basis points, respectively, as compared to
the financial year ended October 31, 2019. We believe our financial results in recent quarters demonstrates the
resiliency and strength of our business model. The COVID-19 lockdown restrictions imposed in March 2020
caused our financial performance to decline but did not stress our overall financial profile given the lower risk
inherent in our partnership model. In addition, during the financial year ended October 31, 2020, £24.4 million in
partner payments were deferred, representing approximately 80% of our total commitments, which illustrates the
flexible land creditor profile we maintain.

**SUMMARY CORPORATE AND FINANCING STRUCTURE**

The diagram below provides a simplified overview of our corporate and financing structure on a
consolidated basis as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions. The diagram does not include all entities within
the Group, nor does it show all of our liabilities. For a summary of the material financing arrangements identified
in the diagram, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”

(1) Maison BidCo Limited (the “Company”) is a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales which was
formed to facilitate the Transactions. The Company will be indirectly wholly owned by Maison Hold Limited (“Holdco”), a private
limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Holdco will be wholly owned by funds and co-investment vehicles
advised by Aermont Capital LLP together with certain management shareholders. See “Our Shareholder.” On the Completion Date, the
Company will directly own all the capital stock of Keystone TopCo Limited (the “Target”). See “Summary—The Transactions—The
_Acquisition.”_

(2) The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or
the relevant Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, as applicable,
including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and will rank senior in right of payment to all existing
and future indebtedness of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the
Company PIK Loan (as defined in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Company PIK Loan”). The Notes and the Notes
Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of the existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured
by property or assets that do not also secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees or that are secured by a first priority fixed charge on
property or assets that secure the Notes by way of a floating charge, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such
indebtedness. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other
liabilities of subsidiaries of the Company that do not provide guarantees.

(3) On the Issue Date, the Notes will initially be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company. Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection and/or registration requirements, the Notes and the Issue Date
Guarantee will be secured on a first priority basis on the Issue Date by (i) a charge over all of the shares in the Company on a third party
limited recourse basis granted by Holdco; (ii) an assignment over intercompany receivables owing by the Company to Holdco; (iii) a
charge over all of the shares in the Issuer granted by the Company; (iv) an English law debenture granted by the Company with respect
to its material bank accounts and a floating charge over all or substantially all of its assets; and (v) an English law debenture granted by
the Issuer with respect to its material bank accounts and any structural intercompany receivables owed to it by the Company and a
floating charge over all or substantially all of its assets. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” In addition, on the Issue Date, to the
extent the Acquisition will not complete on or shortly after the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by the
Escrow Charges relating thereto. Upon the definitive release of the Escrowed Property, the first-priority security interests over the
Escrowed Property will be released and terminated.

(4) Within 150 days of the Completion Date (the “Post-Closing Date”), the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by each of Keepmoat
Limited, Keepmoat Homes Limited and M.C.I. Developments Limited. Subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles,
the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements, within 10 Business Days of the Completion Date, the Notes or the
Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first priority basis by (i) a charge over all of the shares in the Target granted by the Company and
(ii) an assignment over any structural intercompany receivables owing by the Target to the Company, and on or about the Post-Closing
Date, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first priority basis by (i) a charge over all of the shares in Keepmoat
Homes Limited granted by Keepmoat Limited; (ii) a charge over all of the shares in M.C.I. Developments Limited granted by Keepmoat
Homes Limited; and (iii) an English law debenture granted by each Post-Closing Guarantor over its material bank accounts and any


-----

structural intercompany receivables owed to it and a floating charge over all or substantially all of its assets in each case, subject to
customary limitations and exceptions. See “Description of the Notes—Security” and “Description of the Notes—Notes Guarantees.” The
property and assets that will secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees thereof will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility on a firstranking and pari passu basis. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), in the event of a distressed disposal
of, or an enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral
only after the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture to be
secured in priority to the Notes have been repaid in full. The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests
and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The Collateral and the Notes Guarantees may be_
released in certain circumstances.

(5) The Issuer is a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales on September 7, 2021 for the purpose

of issuing the Notes offered hereby and is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Issuer conducts no business operations
of its own and, as of the Issue Date, will have no material assets and its only material liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness
(including its obligations under the Notes) and, as of the Completion Date, its only material assets will be its rights and claims under the
Proceeds Loan. The Issuer has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its formation and the issuance of the Notes. See
“Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure—The Issuer is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary that, following the_
_completion of the Offering, will have no revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on cash flows from operating_
_companies to make payments on the Notes.”_

(6) On or about the Issue Date, the Company will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of £70.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility may
be utilized by the Company, the Issuer and certain of the Company’s restricted subsidiaries which accede to the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement as additional borrowers of that facility and may be applied in or towards (directly or indirectly) financing or refinancing the
working capital and/or the general corporate purposes of the Group. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving
_Credit Facility.”_

(7) Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes.

(8) As of, and for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, the Guarantors accounted for 99% of total assets, 100% of revenue and 99% of
Adjusted EBITDA of the KM Group. The Notes Guarantees will be subject to contractual and legal limitations and may be released
under certain circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—The Notes Guarantees” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and
_Our Structure.”_

-----

Prior to          , 2023, the Issuer will be entitled at its option on one
or more occasions to redeem the Notes in an aggregate principal amount
not to exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
(including the original principal amount of any additional notes) with the

that the net amount received by a holder of the Notes after the
withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that such holder
would have received in the absence of the withholding or deduction. See
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

**Tax Redemption .................................. The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time,**

upon giving prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes _plus accrued and unpaid interest and_
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, if certain changes
in tax law impose certain withholding taxes on amounts payable on the
Notes or the Note Guarantee, and, as a result, the Issuer or an applicable
Guarantor is required to pay additional amounts with respect to such
withholding taxes. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption for
_Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control .............................. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control,**

the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at
a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof _plus_
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
such repurchase. However, a change of control will be deemed not to
have occurred if a specified consolidated net ratio is not exceeded. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure—We will require a_
_significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations,_
_which we may not be able to generate or raise.”_


-----

**Escrow Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption ...................... To the extent the Acquisition will not complete on or shortly after the**

Issue Date, concurrently with the closing of the Offering, and pending
release to consummate of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will
deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Account, held
in the name of the Issuer. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the
Escrow Agent, and charged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee
on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The release of the proceeds
deposited in the Escrow Account will be subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions, including that the funds required to pay the
consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any
event within three Business Days). Upon delivery to the Trustee and the
Escrow Agent of an officer’s certificate stating that the conditions to the
release of the proceeds from escrow are satisfied, the Escrowed Property
will be released to the Issuer and utilized as described in “Use of
_Proceeds,” “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special_
_Mandatory Redemption.” If the conditions to the release of the Escrowed_
Property have not been satisfied on or prior to the business day
immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined in
“Description of the Notes— _Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory_
_Redemption”), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes_
will be subject to a special mandatory redemption.

The special mandatory redemption price of the Notes will be equal to
100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, such special
mandatory redemption date. If the conditions precedent to the release of
the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to
redeem the Notes and, if the Escrow Account alone does not have
sufficient funds to cover such redemption and, as such, the Issuer will be
required to obtain the necessary funds elsewhere, such as equity
investment from shareholders.

In addition, the conditions applicable to the special mandatory
redemption may be waived by holders of the Notes representing a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding.

See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—_ _If_
_the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not_
_satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow_
_Account will not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without_
_relying on an additional equity investment from the shareholders.”_

**Certain Covenants .............................. The Indenture, among other things, restricts the ability of the Issuer, the**

Company and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                      - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue
certain preferred stock;

                      - pay dividends on, or redeem, capital stock and make
certain other restricted payments;

                      - make certain investments;

                      - create or incur certain liens;

                      - sell, lease or transfer certain assets;

                      - agree to restrictions on dividends by restricted
subsidiaries;


-----

                      - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                      - merge or consolidate with other entities; and

                      - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders
of the Notes.

Each of these covenants is subject to a number of significant exceptions
and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants”
and the related definitions.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as we
achieve certain investment-grade ratings. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.”_

**No Established Market for the**
**Notes .................................................... The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no**

established trading market. Although certain of the Initial Purchasers
have advised the Issuer that they intend to make a market for the Notes,
they are not obliged to do so and they may discontinue market making at
any time without notice. Accordingly, there can be no assurances as to
the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes.

**Listing ................................................. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority**

Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the
Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the
“Exchange”). There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on
the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted
or that such listing will be maintained.

**Use of Proceeds ................................... The gross proceeds of this offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date**

will be used, together with the Equity Contribution, to (i) fund the
consideration payable for the Acquisition, (ii) repay Existing Target
Indebtedness, (iii) repay Sellers transaction costs, and (iv) pay the fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

**Governing Law ................................... The Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be governed by**

the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Documents and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are
governed by English law provided that certain schedules in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York (without prejudice to the fact that the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law).

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA**

The tables below set forth the summary historical consolidated financial information and other data of
the KM Group as of and for the dates and for the periods indicated. The Issuer was formed on September 7, 2021,
for the purpose of issuing the Notes offered hereby. The Company was incorporated on July 23, 2021 for the
purposes of facilitating the Transactions. The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Company has no material assets or liabilities, does not
have any revenue generating activities of its own, and has not engaged in actions other than those related to its
incorporation and in preparation of the Transactions. As a result, no historical information of the Company is
included in this Offering Memorandum.

The Issuer conducts no business operations of its own and, as of the Issue Date, will have no material
assets and its only material liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness (including its obligations under the
Notes) and, as of the Completion Date, its only material assets will be its rights and claims under the Proceeds
Loan. The Issuer has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its formation and the issuance of the
Notes.

The Target has not prepared consolidated financial information and operates its business through
Keystone Midco Limited and its subsidiaries. Furthermore, neither the Issuer nor the Company has any material
assets or liabilities and neither has engaged in any activities other than those related to their formation in
preparation for the Offering and the Transactions. Because of the limited historical financial information available
for the Issuer, the Company and the Target, unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this
Offering Memorandum is the historical consolidated financial information of the KM Group, which is generally
representative of the financial information of the Group. See “Presentation of Historical and Other Information—
_Differences Between the Financial Statements of the Target and the KM Group.”_

In 2018, the KM Group changed its financial year end from March 31 to October 31. As a result, the KM
Group’s financial year ended on October 31 for the financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020, and on
March 31 for the financial year ended March 31, 2018. In addition, in connection with the change in financial
year, the KM Group presented audited financial statements as of and for the seven months ended October 31,
2018.

The summary consolidated income statement, balance sheet and cash flow information for the KM Group
set forth below (i) as of and for the financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020 were derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020; (ii) as of and
for the seven months ended October 31, 2018 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as
of and for the seven months ended October 31, 2018; (iii) as of and for the financial year ended March 31, 2018
was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements for the seven months ended October 31, 2018; (iv)
as of and for the nine months ended July 31, 2021 was derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements as of and for the nine months ended July 31, 2021; and (v) as of and for nine months ended
July 31, 2020 was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.

The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for the financial year ended March
31, 2018 has been derived from the restated comparative information contained in the audited financial statements
for the year ended October 31, 2018 as restated to give effect to IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with
_Customers). See note 26 to the financial statements for the seven months ended October 31, 2018 and_
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers).”

In addition, information below includes certain unaudited condensed consolidated financial information
for the KM Group as of and for the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2021. The historical consolidated financial
information of the KM Group for the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2021 is unaudited and has been
calculated by adding the unaudited results of operations of the KM Group for the nine months ended July 31, 2021
to the audited results of operations of the KM Group for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 and then
subtracting the unaudited results of operations of the KM Group for the nine months ended July 31, 2020. The
unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 has been prepared solely for the
purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our
results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the confinement measures imposed by the Government,
construction and home sales activity slowed significantly in the period which continued during the three months


-----

ended October 31, 2020. As a result, our historical results of operations for the three months ended October 31,
2020 do not reflect what the performance of our business would have been had such confinement measures not
been implemented. In order to assist in the comparability of our results of operations for the twelve months ended
July 31, 2021 as compared to prior and future periods, we present herein “Normalized EBITDA” for the twelve
months ended July 31, 2021. We believe that Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 is
a measure that assists in understanding our performance during a period impacted by the market disruption caused
by COVID-19 by substituting the October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA for the October 2019
Management Adjusted EBITDA, comprising the months of our last calendar equivalent financial quarter prior to
the market disruption caused by COVID-19. Our operations during the three months ended October 31, 2020 were
negatively impacted following the government imposed lockdown and the subsequent delayed ramp up on home
construction and sales, before resuming normalized operations during the three month period ended January 31,
2021. As a result, we believe Normalized EBITDA is more representative of our Adjusted EBITDA performance
for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and takes into account, on a highly illustrative basis, the cyclicality of
our business. Normalized EBITDA presented herein is for informational purposes only. Normalized EBITDA for
the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 might not represent what our Adjusted EBITDA would have been for the
same period had the confinement measures not been implemented. In particular, Normalized EBITDA does not
(i) give effect to any other event, favorable or unfavorable, that happened or could have happened during the three
months ended October 31, 2020, other than the events directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic or (ii) adjust
for the positive or negative effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the nine months ended July 31,
2021.

The summary historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum was prepared in
accordance with IFRS. The information below is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any
future periods. The financial data below also includes certain Non-IFRS Measures that are not required by, or
presented in accordance with, IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction. The Non-IFRS Measures
are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction
and should not be considered substitutes to other indicators of the KM Group’s operating performance, cash flows,
or any other measure derived in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”

The following summary historical financial information also includes pro forma financial information
which have been adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions (i) on as adjusted cash interest expense as
if the Transactions had been completed on August 1, 2020, and (ii) on as adjusted total debt, as adjusted total
senior secured net debt and adjusted net debt as if the Transactions had been completed on July 31, 2021. The pro
_forma financial information is for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or to be indicative_
of the consolidated results of operations or financial position we would have reported, had the Transactions been
completed as of (i) August 1, 2020 for the purposes of the calculation of as adjusted cash interest expense and (ii)
July 31, 2021 for purposes of the calculation of as adjusted total debt, as adjusted total senior secured net debt and
as adjusted net debt, nor does such pro forma financial information purport to project as adjusted total debt, as
adjusted total senior secured net debt, as adjusted net debt and as adjusted cash interest expense at any future date.
The _pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are_
reasonable but may differ materially from actual amounts.

The financial information presented for the interim periods or prior years is not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. The financial
information presented herein has been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical
financial information and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and the sections
entitled “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected
_Historical Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations.”_

assets and acquisition fair value adjustments. We view Contribution as a meaningful measure of the underlying operating performance
of the business for historical periods. The following table provides a reconciliation from Gross profit to Contribution for the periods
indicated:

_______________

(A) Exceptional items within cost of sales include development site losses that are included in costs of sales. See note 4 to the financial statements for the
seven months ended October 31, 2018.

(B) As a result of the acquisition of MCI in January 2017, inventory was acquired which included a fair value adjustment to our book value of £0.9
million. The inventory relating to the fair value adjustment was sold during the financial year ended March 31, 2018.

(2) Adjusted EBIT is calculated as operating profit/(loss) before exceptional items, shareholder monitoring fees, amortization of acquisition
intangible assets, acquisition fair value adjustments to inventory and impairment losses of investments in associated companies. Adjusted
EBITDA is calculated as operating profit/(loss) before exceptional items, shareholder monitoring fees, amortization of acquisition
intangible assets, acquisition fair value adjustments to inventory, impairment losses of investments in associated companies,
depreciation, depreciation of right-of-use assets and amortisation of computer software. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are
measures not defined under IFRS and should not be considered a substitute to profit or any other measure of performance derived in
accordance with IFRS or the accounting measures of other jurisdictions. We present Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for
informational purposes only. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA may not provide an accurate or complete picture of the results and
should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial
_Information” for more information. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for_
a description of certain significant factors that are expected to have an impact on our Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA going
forward. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA as of and for the financial year ended March 31, 2018 and as of and for the seven month
period ended October 31, 2018 are accounted for under IAS 17 (Leases) and as such are not directly comparable to the financial
statements as of and for the financial years under October 31, 2019 and October 31, 2020, the nine months ended July 31, 2020 and July
31, 2021 and the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, each of which are accounted for giving effect to IFRS 16 (Leases).

(A) Exceptional items are presented in our statement of comprehensive income. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Description of Statement of Comprehensive Income Items—Exceptional Items.”_

(B) Shareholder monitoring fee, expenses and costs represent fees paid as directed by the current ultimate shareholders of the KM Group in respect of
investment management services.

(C) Acquisition fair value adjustment to inventory is a result of the acquisition of MCI in January 2017, where inventory was acquired which included
a fair value adjustment to book value of £0.9 million. The inventory relating to the fair value adjustment was sold during the financial year ended
March 31, 2018.

(D) Impairment losses of investments in associated companies includes represent the KM Group’s share of the post-acquisition losses of associates up
to the point where the carrying value of any investment is reduced to nil, except to the extent that the KM Group has incurred legal or constructive
obligations.

(3) We define Adjusted EBIT margin as Adjusted EBIT divided by Group revenue.

(4) We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Group revenue.

(5) Gross margin is calculated as Contribution divided by Group revenue.

(A) Capital expenditure and includes investments in information technology capability and joint ventures.

(7) Free Cash Flow conversion is defined as Free Cash Flow as a percentage Adjusted EBITDA.

(8) Tangible net operating asset value is defined as tangible fixed assets, non-acquisition intangible assets, net working capital and Net Land
WIP. Tangible net asset value is defined as tangible net operating asset value less net debt and net other non-operating items. Net working
capital items includes trade debtors, accrued income, prepayments, supplier creditors, subcontractor accounts, accruals and deferred
income (but excludes land development payables). Other non-operating items includes acquisition intangible assets, tax, pension and
lease assets and liabilities.

We view tangible net operating asset value as a measure of the operating net assets required to run the business. We believe that tangible
net operating asset value is therefore helpful for understanding the performance of our business of the KM Group.

land.

(C) Build WIP includes ground works, infrastructure (including roads and drainage) and part built and completed homes.

(9) Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 has been calculated by subtracting the Adjusted EBITDA presented in
our management accounts for each of the months ending August 31, September 30 and October 31, 2020 (with certain adjustments as
necessary to present on a basis comparable to the Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021) (the “October 2020
**Management Adjusted EBITDA”) from the Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and then adding the Adjusted**
EBITDA presented in our management accounts for each of the months ending August 31, September 30 and October 31, 2019 (the
“October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA”).

The chart below provides a reconciliation from Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 to Normalized EBITDA
for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021. The normalized and estimated information presented below has been prepared by, and is the
responsibility of, the KM Group’s management and has not been audited or reviewed and has not been subject to agreed upon procedures
by our statutory auditors in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. This information has been prepared on the basis
of certain assumptions as described herein, but such assumptions do not take into account all conceivable variables and are therefore
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. In addition, such assumptions may not give an accurate or complete picture of the KM
Group’s financial condition or results of operations, may not be comparable to the KM Group’s consolidated financial statements or the
other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and undue reliance should not be placed upon them when evaluating
an investment decision. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures” and “Risk Factors—The
_adjustments to Normalized EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution when making an investment_
_decision.”_

_______________

(A) October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA and October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA have been prepared by, and are the sole
responsibility of, the KM Group’s management. October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA and October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA
have been extracted from the accounting records of the KM Group with such adjustments as necessary to present on a basis comparable to the
Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, and not prepared on the same basis as our financial year end and are not prepared
in accordance with IFRS. PwC has not audited, reviewed, compiled, or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to this data. Accordingly, PwC
does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Such information has been derived from KM Group’s accounting
records. Our preliminary estimates are based on a number of assumptions and adjustments that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to
change. While we believe these results and estimates to be reasonable, our actual results could have varied from these estimates and these differences
could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information.

(B) As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the confinement measures imposed by the Government from March 2020, construction and home sales
activity was significantly impacted in the period, which continued during the three months ended October 31, 2020. As a result, our historical
results of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2020 do not reflect what the performance of our business would have been had such
confinement measures not been implemented. Our operations during the three months ended October 31, 2020 were negatively impacted following
the government imposed lockdown and the subsequent delayed ramp up on home construction and sales, before resuming normalized operations
during the three month period ended January 31, 2021. In order to assist in the comparability of our results of operations for the twelve months
ended July 31, 2021 as compared to prior and future periods, we present herein “Normalized EBITDA” for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021.
We believe that Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 is a measure that assists in understanding our performance during


-----

a period impacted by the market disruption caused by COVID-19 by substituting the October 2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA with October
2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA, comprising the months of our last calendar equivalent financial quarter prior to the market disruption caused
by COVID-19. By the first quarter of our fiscal year 2021 the housing market had rebounded and our operations had normalized. We believe
Normalized EBITDA is more representative of our Adjusted EBITDA performance for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and takes into
account, on a highly illustrative basis, the cyclicality of our business. Normalized EBITDA presented herein is for informational purposes only.
Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 might not represent what our Adjusted EBITDA would have been for the same
period had the confinement measures not been implemented. In particular, Normalized EBITDA does not (i) give effect to any other event or
market and economic conditions or factors, favorable or unfavorable, that happened or could have happened during the three months ended October
31, 2020 or (ii) adjust for the positive or negative effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the nine months ended July 31, 2021.

(10) As adjusted total debt is calculated as the total principal amount of debt, as if the as if the Transactions had taken place on July 31, 2021.

See “Capitalization.” As adjusted total debt excludes unamortized fees in respect of Existing Senior Term Facility and obligations of the
KM Group under the Company PIK Loan.

(11) As adjusted net debt represents as adjusted total debt, less the as adjusted cash and cash equivalents set forth in “Capitalization.” As

adjusted net debt excludes obligations of the KM Group under the Company PIK Loan.

(12) As adjusted cash interest expense represents the cash interest expense on as adjusted total debt as if the Transactions completed as of

August 1, 2020. As adjusted cash interest expense excludes obligations of the KM Group under (i) the Company PIK Loan and (ii) all
of our lease liabilities.

(13) As adjusted total senior secured net debt represents the as adjusted total debt of the Company secured by a first-priority lien on the

Collateral less any cash and cash equivalents as set forth in “Capitalization.” As adjusted total senior secured net debt excludes any
liabilities secured by a fixed charge or mortgage on Collateral that is subject to a floating charge securing the Notes, which include £10.2
million of development loans as of July 31, 2021. The calculation of as adjusted total senior secured net debt assumes that the Revolving
Credit Facility has not been drawn as of the Issue Date.

(1) Completions represent the number of new build homes that we have sold over the applicable period. For private homes this is the number
of legal completions during the period. For Registered Provider homes this represents the equivalent number of units sold, based on the
proportion of work completed under a contract during the period.

(2) ASP represents the average selling price of our homes.

(3) Forward order book represents the aggregate reserved position as of the date thereof, including secured positions with Registered
Providers as well as private reservations by individuals. Our forward order book includes (i) plots that are contracted for but homes have
yet to be completed on the lot and (ii) plot reservations for which contracts have yet to be exchanged.

(4) Open market sales rate represents the average number of open market reservations taken per sales outlet per week over the applicable
period.

(5) Land pipeline plots represent secured and preferred developer plots. Secured plots means that land on which we have a contractual right,
or a conditionally exchanged contract to develop. Preferred developer plots means that land where we have been selected as the preferred
developer or we have won a bidding process, but contracts have not yet been exchanged.

(6) Aggregate pipeline plots as of March 31, 2018 and October 31, 2018 reflected the inclusion of a significant partner framework agreement,
comprising approximately 6,000 plots. Following due diligence as preferred developer, it was determined that the deliverability of
framework sites and their viability to achieve targeted financial returns was in doubt. Consequently, the framework was removed from
the land pipeline, in line with our approach of only including schemes with a high certainty of delivery at required financial returns.

(7) Asset Turn is defined as Group revenue divided by average opening and closing tangible net operating asset value.

(8) ROCE, or return on capital employed, represents the Adjusted EBIT for the relevant period divided by the average of the opening and
closing tangible net operating asset value, expressed as a percentage. We believe that ROCE is a meaningful measure of our profitability


-----

and cash generation for individual sites, regions and the business as a whole. We believe that ROCE is therefore helpful for understanding
the performance of our business. The following table provides the calculation of ROCE for each relevant period.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below together_
_with all the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum before making an investment decision. Any_
_of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations._
_The risks below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or_
_that we currently consider immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition_
_or results of operations which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to pay interest_
_and repay the principal amount in respect of the Notes._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements_
_as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum. For more information, see “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_We are dependent on the UK housing market and subject to deterioration of the UK economy, brought about_**
**_by uncertainty, loss of consumer confidence, higher interest rates, increasing unemployment or other factors,_**
**_which could lead to decreased affordability, reduced demand for housing and falling house prices._**

We operate and generate our revenue exclusively in the UK. As such, our results are highly dependent
on conditions in the UK housing market and general macro-economic conditions in the UK. Historically, the
strength of the UK housing market has been linked to that of the UK economy as a whole, which in turn is
influenced by both European and global macro-economic conditions, all of which have been cyclical in the past.
The following factors (among others) could lead to decreased affordability, reduced demand for housing and
fluctuations in house prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and/or prospects:

      - changes in the economic environment (for example, following Brexit) and macro-economic
uncertainty created thereby;

      - reduction in gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth;

      - increases in unemployment rates;

      - reduction in consumer and business confidence;

      - changes in Government housing support and other regulations;

      - social and industrial unrest;

      - adverse changes in the availability and cost of credit;

      - changes in interest rates; and

      - tax rates (for example, income tax, value added tax (“VAT”), stamp duty and council tax).

Historically, significant changes in the UK economy have had a significant effect on demand for housing.
For example, the economic weakness experienced in the UK following the global financial crisis in 2008 caused
a significant decline in demand for residential property. The declining demand led to a sharp decrease in the
number of residential property transactions in the UK, with the value of new housing construction orders in the
UK (in constant prices and seasonally adjusted) falling by approximately 51% between the first quarter of 2008
and the first quarter of 2009, according to the Office for National Statistics (the “ONS”). Furthermore, the average
UK house price decreased from £259,699 to £216,000 between 2007 and 2009, according to Nationwide.

Adverse changes in the macroeconomic climate of the UK could negatively affect our sales volumes or
the prices for which we sell houses. The UK economy has and may continue to be affected by periods of political
and market uncertainty in Europe and globally, driven by, for example, weaker manufacturing output, ongoing
trade tensions, the US/China trade war and global health pandemics, such as COVID-19. The longer that any such
changes or uncertainties continue, the more likely it is that UK economic growth will slow. Global GDP is
estimated to have fallen by 3.5% in 2020, due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with UK GDP


-----

declining 9.9% in the same year. There continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on UK GDP growth and unemployment rates, particularly as furlough and other support
measures wind down over the course of 2021. A deterioration of the UK economy could negatively affect our
ability to achieve our targets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and/or prospects.

While macroeconomic factors broadly affect the UK construction market as a whole, housing trends in
the UK have also varied significantly by region due to various other factors including regional employment trends,
regional differences in the cost of living, regional differences in population growth and demographic trends, the
perceived desirability of living in different areas of the country and differences in land and house prices. In the
future, should the UK economy stagnate or contract, the variations between regions in the UK may become more
pronounced, and housing projects in any of the areas in which we operate may suffer a greater adverse impact
relative to those in other regions. For the financial year ended October 31, 2020, we derived 63% of our revenue
from our North Division and 37% of our revenue from our South Division.

While decreases in house prices can have an adverse effect on our revenues, increases in house prices
can also have an adverse effect on revenues to the extent that they result in a deterioration in affordability, as our
operations are primarily focused on serving first-time buyers and building homes on the more affordable end of
the housing market.

Additionally, the segment of the UK housing market in which we operate and the success of our
partnership model is largely dependent on investments undertaken by third parties in both the public and private
sectors. The level of investment by the public and private sectors is in part connected to general economic
conditions. There can be no guarantee that current investment trends in our industry will continue in the coming
years, that market conditions will not stagnate or deteriorate or that future austerity measures will not negatively
impact the budgets and spending decisions of our clients. If conditions limit investment by the public and private
sectors, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or
prospects.

**_A majority of our business is secured or supported either directly or indirectly from various Government_**
**_sources, and changes in local or Government funds, loans, grants or subsidies, or changes to or the_**
**_discontinuation of mortgage assistance schemes or equity loan schemes (including in particular Help to Buy)_**
**_could significantly impact our business._**

Our focus is to sell affordable homes, particularly to first-time buyers. We made 76% and 74% of our
private sales to first-time buyers in the financial years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The firsttime buyer market is aided by a supportive structural and political backdrop for affordable housing outside of
London, including through UK central Government funds, loans, grants and subsidies, which assist in the viability
of our schemes.

Since 2016, the Government has increased its focus on providing additional new homes through a number
of policy statements and initiatives, including:

      - an increase in capital funding for the Affordable Homes Programme;

      - a £1 billion loan scheme to support small and medium enterprise (“SME”) home builders;

      - an extension of the Government’s Help to Buy scheme and funding; and

      - additional capital for various funds, including the Housing Infrastructure Fund, the Land
Release Fund and the Planning Delivery Fund.

Our sales have been particularly supported by Help to Buy, a Government equity loan scheme designed
to encourage home ownership in the UK. The Help to Buy program provides assistance to purchasers of newbuild homes in the UK by reducing the minimum down payment required from the purchaser to 5% of a property’s
value and providing an equity loan of up to 20% (or 40% in London) of the property value. In the financial year
ended October 31, 2020, the Help to Buy scheme provided assistance to approximately 67% of our open market
customers to purchase a new home.

The Help to Buy scheme has been modified and extended to March 2023. However, as of April 1, 2021,
the scheme now only supports first-time buyers and imposes regional price caps ranging from £186,100 in the


-----

North East to £600,000 in London. As a result of these reforms, non-first-time buyers who previously would have
been able to secure funding through the Help to Buy scheme are no longer eligible to do so, which in turn could
have an adverse impact on our home sales. In addition, the Help to Buy scheme remains subject to future
regulatory changes, including to applicable eligibility criteria. There can be no assurance that the Help to Buy
scheme will be extended after 2023 or, if it is extended, how it may be modified. Similarly, there is no assurance
that any other similar Government-backed program will continue at current levels, or at all, or that lenders will
participate in them. Any changes to the Help to Buy scheme may reduce the availability of Government funding
of mortgages, which in turn may reduce demand within the homes market.

We occasionally utilize public sector funding at some of our sites, in the form of grants and loans to
support delivery and acceleration of housing outputs. For example, we have accessed a Home Building Fund loan,
a Government fund that supports new homes being built in England. This loan arrangement was entered into in
March 2019.

We occasionally rely on public sector grants from Homes England and Local Authorities. Grants from
these sources may make certain sites economically viable to develop, where such development would not
otherwise have been economically viable without the support from these authorities. The absence of any such
grants in the future could result in a loss of certain development opportunities. Additionally, the Affordable Homes
Programme is a program created in 2010 to provide grant funding to support the capital costs of developing
affordable housing for rent or shared-ownership sale. In connection with the next round of the Affordable Homes
Programme (2021-2026), Homes England will be making available approximately £7.5 billion of funding to
deliver up to 130,000 affordable homes outside of London by March 2026. We believe that this funding will be a
key source of liquidity for Registered Providers (one of our principal customer bases for the sale of homes), and
therefore any changes to or disruption in the provision of grants under the Affordable Homes Programme could
have a material adverse effects on our results of operations. This is particularly true of our MCI business, which
works exclusively with Registered Providers.

The duration and availability of funding for all of the programs referred to above remain subject to
change. In the future, governments and/or local bodies may change their priorities and programs. For example,
authorities may reduce or amend mortgage assistance or investment support schemes, or may undertake welfare
reforms that may impact funding stability for housing associations and Local Authorities. Any reduction or
discontinuation of Government investment, Government funding or Government-backed home purchase
assistance programs may make it more difficult for our core first-time buyer customers to afford homes, which
could in turn make it more difficult for us to sell homes and may force us to either lower prices or source other
forms of mortgage support for customers, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_Our operations, including our operational performance and the welfare of our staff, may be impacted by the_**
**_spread of COVID-19._**

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and measures imposed by the Government to restrict economic and
business activity in response, have had and may continue to have a significant impact on our operations. In
particular, our business and financial performance in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was significantly
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced a significant reduction in our delivery volumes and profit
margins as a result of program disruption and added costs resulting from compliance with government guidelines
on working practices and social-distancing.

Although we undertook certain remedial actions to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including temporarily furloughing employees, temporarily reducing the pay of the executive board and senior
management and accessing Government support, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to
disrupt our operations. In light of Government guidance, we temporarily closed our UK sites and offices from
mid-March to mid-May of 2020, resulting in significantly lower trading when compared to prior and subsequent
periods. We delivered total completions of 2,460 homes in the financial year ended October 31, 2020, which
represented a 39.0% reduction from the 4,035 homes completed in the prior financial year. Over the same period,
our revenue decreased by 37.5%, to £406.0 million for the financial year ended October 31, 2020, from £649.8
million for the prior financial year. Government-mandated quarantines, self-quarantines and staff illness may also
result in key staff being absent from work going forward. Any renewed suspension of our business operations at
our trading sites may affect our overall business and results of operations. A prolonged economic downturn from
the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could also result in us reducing our workforce or incurring charges
by way of staff long-term sick pay.


-----

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, financial condition,
results of operations, prospects and liquidity will depend on numerous evolving factors that are unpredictable,
including the duration and scope of the pandemic, governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been
and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, and the impact of the pandemic on global economic activity,
unemployment levels and financial markets, including the possibility of a global recession and volatility in the
global capital markets which, among other things, may increase the cost of capital and adversely impact our access
to capital. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.

In addition, even as COVID-19 conditions begin to improve and restrictions are reduced or lifted, we
may not regain our operational momentum. Suppliers may reduce or suspend their manufacturing operations as a
result of the effects of COVID-19, and therefore may be not be able to supply our products or services in a cost
effective or timely manner, if at all. Additionally, COVID could have an impact on subcontractors ability and
speed to remobilize from the pandemic, potentially restricting the supply of labor required to deliver construction
on site. See “—Our customers and suppliers are exposed to risks associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic
_and its ramifications on the wider UK economy and the home building industry.”_

Furthermore, there may be future waves of COVID-19 or similar diseases that lead to additional
quarantines with limitations on activity and movement. During the first lockdown that began in March 2020, there
was limited guidance from the Government as to whether the house building industry could continue operations,
which resulted in many housebuilders, including Keepmoat, ceasing building activities altogether for a period of
time. The reintroduction of restrictions or a lack of guidance from the Government regarding the activities allowed
during the course of a future wave of the pandemic could have a significant adverse impact on our business, results
of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_Our customers and suppliers are exposed to risks associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic and its_**
**_ramifications on the wider UK economy and the home building industry._**

In addition to the direct impact on our operations, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact
on the home building industry generally, as well as on our customers and suppliers. For example, as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK housebuilding industry has experienced certain material and services shortages,
including a limited supply of bricks and available subcontractors, which have in turn increased our build costs. If
these or any other shortages are sustained in any significant manner, they could result in delays to construction or
a further increase in the cost of our materials and services.

A broader economic downturn in light of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in reduced construction
activity, lower demand for homes and increased incidence of customers’ inability to pay their accounts, even after
the COVID-19 pandemic has ended. Moreover, economic hardship for some segments of the population,
combined with social distancing and quarantine orders that restrict individuals’ ability to engage in “non-essential”
commercial activity (including construction activity in some instances) could result in a reduction in sales.

Although construction and sales activity was allowed to resume in the UK in May 2020, the outlook for
the national economy remains unclear. House prices in the UK have generally increased following the first
national lockdown, however some of our partners may be reluctant to embark on construction projects in the
current market due to increased economic uncertainty, the possibility that property values will decrease (including
due to lack of availability of debt financing), low investor confidence and concern that any economic downturn
could adversely affect occupational demand and rental growth. The long term impacts of the current situation
remain unknown and could impact construction and sales through, for example, more restrictive on-site working
practices, mortgage availability, increased borrowing rates and reduced levels of government assistance and
stimulus. It is not possible to predict accurately the duration of the current market conditions resulting from the
pandemic, the extent to which COVID-19 government stimulus programs will remain in place or the timing or
strength of any future recovery of the UK economy.

Furthermore, we are exposed to the risk of default by customers who have agreed to purchase homes
from us, suppliers who have agreed to supply materials and/or pay volume-related rebates to us under framework
agreements, and others with whom we have entered into financial and other arrangements. A number of our
customers and suppliers have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the worldwide pandemic,
quarantine orders, financial uncertainty, disruptions to capital and credit markets and decreased demand for their
services. Our exposure to default by counterparties may increase if economic conditions deteriorate. Moreover,
we may be unable to procure supplies in a sufficient quantity or timely manner, especially where suppliers have
shut down manufacturing sites and furloughed employees. If such supply disruptions were to occur, we may not


-----

be able to develop alternative sources quickly on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In the event that any
of our key customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are further adversely
affected by these risks, we may face further reductions in revenue, loss of customers and disruptions in supply
which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or
prospects. There may also be significant fluctuations in our operating results and the results for any period may
not be indicative of results for any future period.

**_We rely on maintaining strong relationships with Local Authorities, Homes England, Registered Providers and_**
**_housing associations, and these entities may be subject to reduced funding and other changes to their_**
**_operations due to economic and political factors outside of their control._**

Our business is based primarily on a partnership model, we primarily develop in collaboration with
partners that have some form of long-term continuing interest (either through ownership or social responsibility)
in the relevant development, primarily land owners (such as Homes England, Local Authorities and private land
owners) and Registered Providers. As a result, our success depends on our ability to maintain strong relationships
with Local Authorities, Homes England, Registered Providers, housing associations and other public entities in
the UK. Approximately 79% of the plots in our land pipeline as of July 31, 2021 were being developed under the
partnership model.

Our partnership projects are often awarded through competitive public procurement processes and often
based on the Local Authority or housing association’s perception of a developer’s expertise, design quality,
reputation, price and value. Non-financial criteria, such as planning and design capability, customer service record,
track record of delivering high-quality homes with minimal defects, delivery capacity and proposals to address
social and economic sustainability issues, typically account for more than 50% of an applicant’s score in public
procurement processes. As a result, our reputation and relationships with partner organizations are critical to the
success of our business. In addition, Local Authorities often have oversight and authority over multiple potential
development sites and previous Local Authority clients are thus an important source of referral and repeat business
for our business.

We are one of the largest strategic delivery partners of Homes England. As of July 31, 2021, we had
directly and indirectly accessed approximately £450 million of funding initiatives to facilitate the delivery and
acceleration of housing outputs, secured approximately 9,200 plots on 38 different sites for development through
Homes England’s Delivery Partner Panel (“DPP”) and delivered or were in the process of delivering over 3,055
homes in partnership on Homes England land over the last 12 years. As a result, maintaining a strong working
relationship with Homes England is important to our operations, as a deterioration of this relationship could result
in both reputational and financial consequences for us. Furthermore, if Homes England were to make changes to
the way it conducts the DPP or otherwise change the way it disposes of public land, this could have an adverse
impact on our ability to access development opportunities through the panel or increase the competition for
development opportunities.

Homes England is currently preparing to launch its successor to the DPP on September 1, 2021, known
as the Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System (“DPDPS”). The DPDPS is designed to modernize the
bidding process through the use of a digital system which encourages new entrants to the market, and thereby
simplifies the process for housebuilders to join the list of preferred developers and bid for land. With this new
system, housebuilders will still have to ‘qualify’ to be able to join the list of preferred developers, but they will be
able to apply to join at any time, rather than only upon renewal of the delivery partner panel once every four years,
as is currently the case. We have submitted our application and had confirmation we have been appointed to be
part of the DPDPS, which is not expected to be used to procure schemes until late 2021. Although DPDPS will
not change the way in which schemes are procured and the legal structure under which they will be delivered on
sites larger than 70 plots, the new system is likely to increase competition for development opportunities with
Homes England. A material decline in opportunities sourced through Homes England could have a material
adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

Local authorities, Homes England, housing associations and other public entities in the UK can be subject
to reduced funding and other changes to their operations and structure as a result of both economic and political
factors outside of their control. This could, in turn, lead to such bodies curtailing their development activities,
which would reduce the partnership opportunities available to us. Any reduction in development activities by
these entities would likely have a relatively greater impact on Keepmoat than on many of our competitors given
our partnership-focused business model. In addition, governmental bodies may seek to influence or change the
scope or direction of Local Authorities’ activities for political reasons and, even without direct pressure, changes
in national Government policy may affect Local Authorities’ decisions on local planning issues. Although all of


-----

the three main political parties currently support an expansion of the supply of affordable homes in the UK, this
may change in the future. In the event that there is a change of Government or economic and political factors
which result in a loss of support for, or a major reorganization of, the public sector bodies with which we work,
we may need to rebuild our relationships or risk losing partnership opportunities with these organizations. If we
are unable to maintain our relationships with these organizations, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_The availability, cost, quality and location of land are fundamental to our business, and failure to identify and_**
**_secure suitable land could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial_**
**_condition and/or prospects._**

Our business relies upon our ability to acquire land at appropriate prices and in appropriate locations.
We do not have any control over the volume and timing of partnership land pipeline opportunities, and if we are
unable to continue to secure land through our partnership model with housing associations and Local Authorities,
we may be unable to source land at commercially acceptable prices, on favorable terms or at all. Failure to identify
suitable land, obstacles in the purchasing process, failure to manage land purchases to meet the demands of the
business or increases in the costs of such purchases could mean that we are unable to obtain an adequate supply
of land. Consequentially, an inability to source sufficient suitable land that meets the requirements of our business
model could affect our volume growth targets. In addition, increased demand for land from our competitors may
lead to increases in the prices that we are required to pay for land, which may affect the profitability of our
developments. Our development activities are also affected by the planning status of the land we secure, and there
may be changes in law or regulation between the time when initial planning permission is given for a particular
site and the time at which we begin construction, which could cause delays, increase costs, reduce the expected
rate of return or make a proposed development financially unviable. See “—We are subject to local and national
_planning policies which have an impact on our operations.”_

The timing of our land acquisitions may also have a material impact on our financial condition, including
the returns we are able to generate from our developments. We occasionally source plots through speculative land
purchases for certain of our sites, particularly when seeking to increase presence in new regions. These speculative
purchases generally involve material upfront investments of our own capital. In such cases, we may pay higher
average prices for plots as we compete with other home builders for available land, which may in turn reduce our
margins and return on capital employed and increase reliance on our current ongoing projects. Unforeseen events
may also have a negative impact on our ability to source land, which may have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. See “—The net realizable value of the
_Group’s build work-in-progress (“WIP”) and land may decline.”_

**_The UK home building market is competitive._**

Although we largely operate a non-traditional home building business model through the use of our
partnership model, we compete with traditional home builders for sites, financing, partnership opportunities with
Local Authorities and housing associations, materials, skilled labor and home buyers. Within the wider housing
market, we also compete for home buyers with second-hand housing sales. Our competitors include other local,
regional and national home builders, and new competitors may enter the home building market. Some of these
competitors may enjoy greater sales and financial resources, lower funding costs, or lower operational costs than
us and their participation or entry into the partnerships market, in particular, could impair our ability to win public
procurement processes at economically viable levels or at all. For example, in certain invitations to tender issued
by Local Authorities or housing associations, bids that propose payment structures including deposits and/or early
up front land price payments attract higher scores. To the extent our competitors are increasingly willing to make
such deposits and/or early up front land price payments, we may be required to make bids on the same basis in
order to win these public procurement processes, which could in turn increase our up-front costs and reduce our
ability to use our preferred capital light operating model. Many of these competitors also have longstanding
relationships with housing associations, Local Authorities, subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which
we operate.

Furthermore, in an increasingly competitive sales environment, there is increased risk that we may fail
to sell houses as quickly as anticipated, may need to increase selling incentives or marketing costs or may be
forced to sell at lower than projected prices. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.


-----

**_The inability of our customers to procure a mortgage or other form of funding, or increased costs of financing,_**
**_could lead to decreased sales and reservations and the cancellation of sale contracts._**

The growth of the housing market depends largely on the ability of customers to secure financing to buy
a home, as well as on how confident they are about their ability to make regular payments on their mortgages over
multiple subsequent years. During periods of weak economic conditions or strong house price inflation,
prospective homebuyers’ purchasing power often depends on their ability to borrow funds and access Government
stimulus programs. Our sales are therefore impacted by banks’ and other lenders’ willingness and ability to
provide financing to prospective homebuyers, and the terms on which they are willing and able to do so. In the
financial year ended October 31, 2020, 91% of our private sales buyers purchased homes with the assistance of
mortgages. Any decrease in the availability of mortgages is likely to have a negative impact on our customers’
ability to purchase new houses.

Changes to lending criteria such as increased checks on personal finances or the introduction of more
onerous lending restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of home buyers to secure a
mortgage. Similarly, changes to mortgage terms, including loan-to-value ratios and other lending criteria, average
duration and interest rates are also likely to have a direct impact on demand for the housing. In particular, actual
and expected monetary policies of the Bank of England, including both the speed and magnitude of any interest
rate increases, are likely to have an impact on the interest rates that banks and other lenders provide. Increases in
the base rate have previously had a negative impact on the UK property market because mortgage interest rates
have experienced a corresponding increase, thereby making it more expensive for prospective buyers to purchase
residential property.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Bank of England base rate was 0.1%. Despite the
current low base rate environment, levels of mortgage lending throughout the UK remain low compared to those
of certain other developed countries. Prospective buyers who can obtain a mortgage at current interest rates may
also be deterred by the possibility of increased mortgage interest rates in the future. Higher interest rates (and, in
turn, higher monthly interest payments) may also make mortgages unobtainable or unaffordable for some
prospective buyers. Investor buyers also are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, as higher interest rates
negatively affect their investment returns. The Bank of England may raise its base rate at any time, which could
have an adverse impact on transaction volumes and prices in the UK’s residential property market, and may in
turn reduce the volume and value of property transactions facilitated by Keepmoat and the revenue that we derive
from them. In particular, the Bank of England may be compelled to increase the base rate as a result of inflation.
Any increase in the costs of mortgage financing in the future may make it more difficult for us to sell homes,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or
prospects.

Future changes in Government policy and stimulus programs may also adversely affect the ability of our
customers to obtain Government financial assistance and mortgages. See “—A majority of our business is secured
_or supported either directly or indirectly from various Government sources, and changes in local or Government_
_funds, loans, grants or subsidies, or changes to or the discontinuation of mortgage assistance schemes or equity_
_loan schemes (including in particular Help to Buy) could significantly impact our business.” Our focus is selling_
affordable homes to first-time buyers, and if it becomes more difficult to secure a mortgage or obtain Government
financial assistance, first-time buyers may be particularly impacted, as such customers tend to require loans with
higher loan-to-value ratios. Although we review a prospective buyer’s ability to qualify for a mortgage or other
form of funding prior to entering into a contract and reporting the transaction as a sale, this initial review is based
solely on information provided to us by the buyer, without independent verification. For reference, we do not
contract on a house sale to a customer without a formal mortgage offer from a mortgage lender. To the extent
there were a significant deterioration in the ability of our customers to obtain mortgage approvals or otherwise
finance their home purchases, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and/or prospects.

**_Our results of operations are affected by the cyclical nature of the home building and construction industries_**
**_as well as fluctuations in the price and supply of materials._**

The home building industry tends to be cyclical and is dependent on the level of construction-related
expenditures in the residential sector, public investments and public and private spending on infrastructure
projects. The home building industry is particularly sensitive to factors such as GDP growth, interest rates, the
cost of mortgage financing for residential construction, inflation, consumer confidence, income growth (in real
terms), increases in the cost of living and other macroeconomic factors. Political instability or changes in
Government policy may also negatively affect the home building industry. Moreover, demand in the home


-----

building industry may be affected by demographic trends, such as ageing and declining populations in mature
markets, changes in the average number of persons living in one household and domestic and international
migration trends.

The cyclicality of the construction industry also impacts the supply of materials and labor. During periods
of market contraction, labor force participants leave the market, sometimes permanently, to retrain in other
professions or move elsewhere in search of work. As markets recover, demand for labor increases and the
associated impact on the cost and availability of labor can impact our business.

We have several key suppliers, contractors and subcontractors in the various regions in which we operate,
with whom we regularly contract to provide construction and various other services for the development of the
Group’s sites. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, our top supplier, which is a materials merchant,
represented 30.6% of our total expenditure for direct materials. If any of our suppliers fail to provide timely or
adequate services, labor, equipment or raw materials, we may be required to source these products and services at
a higher price than anticipated and may face delays at our project sites until we are able to identify an appropriate
alternative supplier, contractor or subcontractor. Although we attempt to control subcontractor rate increases on
our developments by fixing subcontractor prices over a phase, or part-phase, of a development through the use of
“all risk” contracts and by matching subcontractor agreements to our agreements with land owners, we cannot
eliminate our exposure to cyclical cost increases during development which may have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. See “—Our customers and suppliers
_are exposed to risks associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic and its ramifications on the wider UK_
_economy and the home building industry.”_

Although we endeavor to utilize our group supply chain suppliers across all regions, our materials
suppliers vary in each region in which we operate due to the specific requirements of our projects. Although we
include materials cost estimates in our tenders, materials are subject to price as well as availability fluctuations,
such that even if we include flexibility in our tenders for an increase in costs, we still may not be able to source
the necessary materials, which could affect our ability to deliver schemes to program.

We are heavily impacted by our ability to source essential materials such as bricks and blocks. The supply
of essential materials may be delayed or interrupted due to factors beyond our control, such as materials shortages
or disruptions in the supply chain. See “—We could be adversely affected by uncertainty, disruption or other
_consequences of Brexit.” In addition, the cyclicality of the construction industry impacts the supply of materials_
so that in times of market contraction, production is scaled back and therefore when markets recover there can be
a lag in the supply chain which may lead to increased prices. Bricks, for example, can be difficult to source in the
UK during periods of increased building activity and are a necessary material for our operations. A shortage in
the supply of bricks in the UK typically results in the need to import bricks from overseas, which in turn may
result in an increase in brick prices owing to transport costs and delays in their availability, both of which could
result in significant increases in the cost of our construction projects and delay completions of sites. Any disruption
to a regular supply of materials could result in project delays and increased costs if alternative suppliers are unable
to provide timely replacements at competitive prices. Moreover, we may be unable to pass on any or all of the
increased materials costs to our customers. Any price fluctuations or supply interruptions as a result of the
foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition
and/or prospects.

**_We could be adversely affected by the current shortage of HGV drivers in the United Kingdom._**

As has been well publicized recently, the UK is currently experiencing a shortage of heavy-goods
vehicles (“HGV”) drivers, which has become more visible in the past weeks as the shortage of qualified drivers
has resulted in supply chain issues impacting fuel deliveries, forcing some petrol stations to close or limit the
supply of fuel available for purchase, and shortages of good deliveries to retailers. The Road Haulage Association
has estimated that there could be a shortage in the UK of more than 100,000 drivers, as compared to a pre-COVID
total of approximately 600,000 drivers. It has been reported that the current shortage has been partially attributable
to Brexit, in which European HGV drivers have opted to work solely within EU countries or have left the UK, in
part due to the increase bureaucracy and costs involved in travelling to and from the UK and an estimated 15,000
EU HGV drivers opting to leave the UK given travel restrictions imposed as part of Covid mitigation measures.
The shortage has also been blamed on a suspension and delay of an estimated 30,000 HGV qualification tests in
2020 due to the Covid pandemic which resulted in a reduction of an estimated 25,000 potential HGV driver
candidates passing the test in 2020 as compared to 2019. With the average age of an HGV driver in the UK of 55
years, the industry has further been vulnerable to relatively high attrition due to retirements as well as changes
that have cut earnings of some HGV drivers. The Government has responded by announcing that it is considering


-----

measures to recruit and train HGV drivers such as increasing the number of HGV driving tests taking place and
providing temporary visas for EU HGV drivers. In addition, many employers have increased salary and have
offered bonuses and new driving schemes. However, these measures will most likely take time to have an impact.

While we have not yet seen any noticeable impact from the shortfall in HGV drivers, there is a risk that
the current shortfall could impact our business in the event that the ongoing HGV driver shortfall results in delays
in the supply chain for our raw materials or the inability of our contractors to maintain their workforce necessary
to operate the heavy equipment essential for our developments, which in turn could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. In addition, the shortfall in HGV
drivers could increase the cost for raw materials and the costs of our contractors which could be passed on to us,
leading to a potential in decreased margins. We will continue to monitor the potential impact of the shortfall in
HGV drivers on our business and operations.

**_We could be adversely affected by uncertainty, disruption or other consequences of Brexit._**

On January 31, 2020, the UK left the EU, entering into a transition period that ended on December 31,
2020. This process is unprecedented in EU history and the effects of Brexit remain uncertain. Uncertainty also
exists over the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK, which provides for
the free movement of goods between the UK and the EU and which was entered into on December 24, 2020. In
particular, legal uncertainty exists around potentially divergent national laws and regulations in relation to
financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, immigration laws and employment laws which may
adversely affect economic or market conditions in the UK, the EU or globally. This uncertainty could contribute
to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the pound
sterling, which could negatively affect our revenues and the broader economic environment on which the home
building industry depends. Given that substantially all of our profits are generated from the housing market, a
significant negative impact on the UK economy as a result of Brexit could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

In addition, we may face challenges attracting non-British EU workers following Brexit, which could
impact our business and growth in the future. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 3.0% of the Group’s
employees were non-UK citizens, with the majority being citizens of member states of the EU. However, EU
nationals could comprise a part of the Group’s subcontractor workforce and their skillsets are such that, if Brexit
materially limits the ability or willingness of those subcontractors to work in the UK, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

Brexit may also put pressure on our supply chain. Most of our building supplies are manufactured in the
UK and therefore are not directly exposed to future trade arrangements with the EU. However, a portion of the
products procured through our network of UK based suppliers are imported from the EU. Additional requirements
associated with the importation of goods from the EU could adversely impact our supply chain and increase the
costs of imported construction materials. We continue to work closely with those suppliers to monitor the potential
impact as the UK adapts to the new trade arrangements with the EU. Any increase in the prices of raw materials
as a result of any new trade arrangements may lead to decreased margins.

**_Our business depends on the continued availability, viability and cost of subcontractors and other service_**
**_providers._**

Our business model requires us to hire third party subcontractors to provide onsite work. Although our
business model has key differences from other traditional home builders, we compete within the same labor pools
and changes in the labor market directly impact our costs. When activity in the home building market increases,
we tend to face escalating cost pressures associated with shortages of skilled labor, particularly skilled bricklayers.
Restrictions on the free movement of people as a result of Brexit and other changes to UK immigration policies
could result in tight supply due to reduced availability of skilled labor from outside the UK. Poor availability of
labor could significantly impact our ability to operate efficiently and deliver projects on time with high levels of
partner and customer satisfaction. See “—We could be adversely affected by uncertainty, disruption or other
_consequences of Brexit” and “—Our customers and suppliers are exposed to risks associated with the current_
_COVID-19 pandemic and its ramifications on the wider UK economy and the home building industry.”_

If we are unable to find or hire qualified and reliable third party subcontractors for any of our projects,
our ability to successfully complete projects on time or at all could be impaired. Furthermore if any of these third
parties fail to provide timely or adequate services, labor, equipment or raw materials, we may be required to source
these services and products at a higher price than anticipated and may face delays at our project sites until we are


-----

able to identify an appropriate alternative subcontractor. See “—Our results of operations are affected by the
_cyclical nature of the home building and construction industries as well as fluctuations in the price and supply of_
_materials.”_

Additionally, as we have experienced from time to time in the past, we are exposed to the risk that the
subcontractors that we employ may subsequently become insolvent, causing cost overruns and program delays,
thereby increasing the risk that we will be unable to recover costs in relation to any defective work performed by
such subcontractors. These risks are compounded during times of economic downturn, as subcontractors or any
other third parties that we conduct business with may experience financial difficulties or find it difficult to obtain
sufficient financing to fund their deliveries or operations.

We are also exposed to the risk of litigation or claims relating to breaches of contract by third party
subcontractors. Furthermore, substandard work by subcontractors could result in claims against us for failure to
meet required project specifications.

If a subcontractor or supplier of goods or services fails financially or is responsible for late or inadequate
delivery or poor quality of work on a project, then it could damage our reputation and result in financial losses for
us. The insolvency, poor performance or other financial distress of one or more of our subcontractors may have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_We operate in a highly regulated industry and our businesses are subject to a complex regulatory environment_**
**_which may change._**

We are required to comply with national, local, and other laws and regulations and administrative
requirements and policies which relate to, among other matters, planning, developing, building land use, sales,
providing or arranging the mortgage market, health and safety, environment, employment, bribery (including
under the UK Bribery Act of 2010), competition and money laundering. These laws and regulations and
administrative requirements and policies that affect both the housing sector and ancillary sectors, often provide
broad discretion to the administering authorities. Any uncertainty or changes in relevant laws, regulations or
policies, or the interpretation thereof, may delay or prevent us from being able to achieve our strategic plans, give
rise to substantial compliance, remediation and other costs, or could prohibit or severely restrict us from
developing and building in certain locations.

In addition, following on from incidents such as the Grenfell Tower fire in London in June 2017,
regulation has increased around building assessments and fire safety, particularly for tall buildings. In light of
such increased regulation, and the fact that we have in the past used combustible paneling material for a limited
number of our properties (low-rise dwellings of no more than three stories), there is a risk that properties owned
and/or constructed by Keepmoat may in future be considered to have been built with materials that are assessed
to be or have the potential to be, the cause of, or a contributing factor to, the spread of fire or other destruction of
properties, or compromise residents’ safety.

There is also a risk that the Government, regulators or lenders could issue further guidelines in relation
to combustible materials, including aluminum composite material cladding, high pressure laminate, and/or wood
cladding and/or other external structures including fire safety procedures or otherwise as a result of which it may
be necessary for us to remediate our buildings. If such an event occurs, there may be significant costs and expenses
to rebuild the property and/or rectify the problem and our returns may decrease. Our brand and reputation may
also be harmed.

Each aspect of the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change. Changes, including
(but not limited to) in the following areas could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results:

      - building regulations;

      - labor laws;

      - health and safety regulations;

      - local and national planning policies (see “—We are subject to local and national planning
_policies which have an impact on our operations”);_

      - environmental, sustainability and land use requirements; and


-----

      - regulation regarding provision of mortgages.

In particular, we are subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies concerning the protection of
health, safety and the environment. For example, in England, changes regarding Part L of the Building Regulations
2010 (“Part L”), are currently in the final stages of consultation, relating to requirements concerning the
conservation of fuel and power. The proposed changes are currently anticipated to be released by the end of 2021
and are expected to come into effect from June 2022. The introduction of the changes to Part L as a transitional
step towards the proposed ‘Future Homes Standard’ is a direct outcome of the Government’s Energy White Paper
commitment to (i) raising the energy performance of buildings by limiting heat losses and excessive solar gains,
(ii) ensuring that energy-efficient fixed building services are installed, and (iii) ensuring that the building owner
is provided with the information required to maintain the building and its services. Reducing carbon emissions for
new build properties remains high on the Government’s and Local Authority partner’s agenda and plays a large
part in the design and construction of new build properties. The carbon emission reduction targets set by current
Part L standards, alongside the industry’s modern-day good practice standards for air quality, acoustics and
overheating, encourage building designers to consider more complex design solutions with bespoke user
operational assumptions. If these changes are not reviewed and implemented in a timely manner, there is a risk
that we may be non-compliant with the changing building regulations. In addition, changing building regulations
are likely to have an impact on our underlying construction costs, with potential additional costs incurred to meet
the requirements of increasing standards.

The proposed Future Homes Standard is in the early stages of consultation as part of a commitment by
the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to ensure all new homes reduce their carbon dioxide
emissions by over 75%, through low carbon heating and “world-leading levels of energy efficiency” by 2025. The
Scottish Government is also going through a similar process of reviewing and consulting on proposed changes to
current building regulations to significantly reduce the carbon emissions of new homes, so the same risks apply
in Scotland as well. Local authorities are already empowered under the Planning and Energy Act 2008 to drive
local agendas for sustainability and may ask on this basis for a variety of standards to be applied, including the
Zero Carbon Emissions homes standard. This standard is higher than that of the proposed Future Homes Standard
and in advance of the current Government roadmap.

The above proposed changes could have a significant impact on housebuilder operations and will affect
new and, potentially, existing sites (to the extent existing sites are under development at the time the changes take
effect), subject to any transitional arrangements and/or accommodations for existing sites that may be put into
place. The proposed Future Homes Standard will also include the development of unproven gas free solutions and
there is therefore the risk of reputational damage for housebuilders if solutions fail to work as intended and create
high levels of energy usage and running costs for customers. Delivery may also be affected as supply chains need
to be developed for low carbon energy solutions.

In addition, the Government has introduced a set of principles and guidance for the UK construction
industry titled ‘Biodiversity Net Gain’. This initiative is designed to encourage developers to incorporate
appropriate natural habitat and ecological features to offset the effects of the development in order to stem the loss
of biodiversity through development and restore ecological networks. Compliance with these principles and
guidance could result in an additional cost to us. Furthermore, the nature of the principles and guidance could
result in a disadvantage to the development of brownfield sites, which represent a significant part of our business.
See also “—Ownership, leasing or occupation of land as well as home building carries potential environmental
_risks and liabilities, including liability under claims for damages as a result of use of hazardous materials,_
_including asbestos.”_

**_Difficulties and complications encountered in connection with the construction process and other events that_**
**_may arise in the course of construction could disrupt our business and could result in substantial increases in_**
**_total costs or adversely affect our returns._**

When securing a development opportunity and agreeing the financial terms of the development with our
partners (where relevant) prior to construction, we make cost estimates which are dependent upon assumptions,
estimates and judgments which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. While we attempt to mitigate this risk by
taking reasonable steps to ensure that our risk management and financial and operational procedures, controls and
systems are appropriate for our businesses, there is no guarantee that significant unanticipated costs will not arise.
If we fail to accurately assess expected costs, revenue or risks on a particular contract, then we may fail to achieve
our expected returns. Our returns depend on costs being controlled and projects being completed on time. For
example, cost overruns, whether due to inefficiency, poor design, faulty estimates, insufficient oversight,
omissions, failure to use systems or comply with our processes, unforeseen technical conditions, cost escalation


-----

for materials (such as timber framing, bricks, concrete, polymer and steel) (including due to inflation), and/or cost
overruns by (or increased rates of) subcontractors or other factors, can result in a lower return on a project. Should
significant unanticipated costs arise, they could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, business
prospects and financial condition. In addition, failure to follow best practice guidelines could mean that projects
are not delivered on time or do not meet agreed quality, appropriate health and safety or environmental standards
and therefore do not meet customer expectations and may give rise to contractual or other liabilities.

Our most significant costs are our subcontractor and supplier costs, and we rely on local and regional
subcontractors from a variety of trades. Our subcontractors generally provide us with services on the basis of
fixed-term, fixed-price contracts based on agreed specifications while our suppliers generally agree to make
deliveries on the basis of pre-agreed prices. However, although we budget construction costs for each site before
construction begins, building and construction costs can increase above anticipated amounts as a result of
unforeseen events, which may result in the pre-agreed contractual prices not applying even where such
arrangements are in place.

We may face additional costs or delays related to, among other things, unexpected technical challenges,
changes in development specifications, exceptional weather conditions that delay work, labor shortages, accidents
during construction, the insolvency or poor performance of a subcontractor, environmental factors, changes in
consumer preferences (leading to the need to change design once construction has already begun) or new
regulations or legal requirements. For larger projects, these risks are inherently greater. If circumstances change,
a lower profit or a loss on a project may result. In addition, if a subcontractor’s or supplier’s cost estimates or
quotes provided to us are incorrect, we may incur additional costs or be required to source products and services
at a higher price than anticipated, as well as face delays at our project sites if the estimate is incorrect by a large
enough margin that the project is better served by finding an alternative contractor or supplier. These unforeseen
events could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

A number of the contracts we enter into in connection with the development of our sites include certain
delivery milestones. If delays to these projects lead to a failure to meet deadlines, it could result in a breach of
contract for which we could be liable. The typical approach that we adopt when circumstances arise which may
prevent us from meeting delivery milestones is to negotiate with our counterparties to seek to amend the contract
as necessary. However, there can be no assurance that such counterparties would be amenable to such changes.
Failure to meet delivery milestones could affect our reputation and future prospects, expose us to additional costs
and result in contractual penalties or the calling of surety bonds, where applicable, that may impact our profit
margins and result in the termination of contracts. Furthermore, any delays or underperformance in our projects
may lead to conflicting demands on resources allocated to other projects. Also, for some projects, we may be
required to build commercial spaces and mixed-use facilities, areas that are not part of our core business and
expertise and therefore pose additional execution risks during construction. The failure to meet project deadlines
and targets, in either the construction or sales process, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_A major health and safety incident could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage._**

Health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Worksites are
inherently dangerous places and operating in the home building industry poses certain health and safety risks.
Some of our operations are conducted at sites in which residents are in occupancy which adds additional risk to
the inherently dangerous nature of a worksite. Any significant accident or health and safety failure could result in
significant harm to any person present, including any current resident or member of the general public at or near
the worksite. There can be no assurance that a major accident or safety incident will not cause significant bodily
injury, physical harm or death of any person present or nearby.

Any failure in health and safety procedures or performance may result in penalties for non-compliance
with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure which results in a major or significant health and safety
incident may be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result, including significant compensation
payments and fines, and may lead to operational failure. Furthermore, such a failure could also generate significant
adverse publicity and have a negative impact on our reputation and our ability to win new business (in particular
with respect to entering into partnerships with public bodies, which is a key part of our strategy), and may expose
management to personal criminal liability, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.


-----

**_Our results of operations are affected by seasonal effects._**

Our business is, to a certain extent, dependent on weather conditions and is subject to seasonality.
Historically, our revenues and levels of working capital vary during the course of the year due to higher volumes
of completions taking place in certain months of the year. As a result, our debt profile has grown and contracted
over the course of the financial year, consistent with certain seasonal trends.

Typically, the majority of our reservations for open market sales are made in January to March and
August to October (with the latter correlated to the start of new school years). Our ability to manage the timeline
from the engagement and planning phase to the exchange of contract and legal completion is, therefore, one of
the factors that affects the timing of completions. Although we generally have a significant degree of flexibility
in managing the phasing of completions and typically aim to stagger the timing of our completions to the extent
practicable, the impact of weather on building activity and plot delivery has increased the likelihood of a peak in
completions in the late summer and early autumn.

In addition, prior to the change of the KM Group’s financial year end from March 31 to October 31 in
2018, divisional efforts to achieve targets and maximize sales for the financial year end led to a peak of
completions in March. This had an effect on our results of operations for the financial year ended October 31,
2019, as our incentive scheme for that financial year remained tied to an end date of March 31. However, we do
not expect this to have an impact on our financial results in any subsequent years. For the financial year ended
October 31, 2021 we have amended our incentive targets to include an additional measure tied to half-year targets,
in order to achieve a more levelled number of completions throughout the financial year.

The above factors may lead to volatility in our quarterly financial results. These factors that affect the
phasing of completions through a financial year tend to result in a peak in the number of plot completions, and
accordingly revenue and profit, to the last quarter of each financial year. Results of a single fiscal quarter or half
year might therefore not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a full financial year and may not be comparable
with the results in the other fiscal quarters or half year. Factors that affect our peak selling seasons can have a
disproportionate impact on our performance in a particular period.

**_We are subject to local and national planning policies which have an impact on our operations._**

Local and national planning policies have an impact on the financial performance of housing
development. Our ability to obtain the necessary and timely planning permissions is dependent on our ability to
meet the relevant regulatory and planning requirements, including detailed planning consents and technical
approvals. Planning policies can restrict the availability of new land for which suitable planning permission is
available and closely control how land is developed. For example, planning permissions can prescribe specific
conditions on matters including density, types of housing and availability of car parking spaces. The estimated
number of plots and the economic feasibility of development represented by our land may also be reduced due to
planning considerations. As of July 31, 2021, we did not have planning permissions (detailed or outline) for
approximately 21% of our land pipeline of 24,654 plots. Although we have generally been successful in obtaining
similar planning consents in the past, there can be no certainty that we will obtain planning permission for schemes
which currently lack them on a timely or cost-effective basis, or at all, and the final permission that we obtain may
vary significantly from the assumptions made at the time of acquisition. For example, the gross development value
of the site may be lower than anticipated, or the costs to complete development of the site may be higher than
anticipated, potentially causing significant deterioration in a project’s value. Certain planning authorities continue
to be under-resourced, affecting their capacity to manage applications and develop local plans. Additionally, the
planning processes for many of our projects involve public consultations, which may result in adjustments to the
preferred development plan, adverse planning outcomes or negative publicity.

We may also be required to make significant expenditures on community infrastructure and facilities and
provide a minimum amount of affordable housing as a condition of receiving planning permission, as well as
provide other community benefits and payments due under the Community Infrastructure Levy.

Any failure to obtain planning permissions in line with our development plans or at all may have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

Additionally, we are subject to the risk of non-compliance with planning conditions or planning
obligations connected with planning consents. If we are found to have not complied with these planning conditions
or planning obligations, our development could be deemed unlawful or subject to service of enforcement notices
or, in severe cases, result in an inability to sell affected plots.


-----

While the Group has developed policies and procedures to comply with existing requirements, there can
be no assurance that these requirements will not change. For example, in 2012, the NPPF was published which
was aimed at, among other matters, simplifying planning and ensuring local communities are the keystone of the
planning system. The NPPF underwent a substantive revision in July 2018, resulting in more than 80 reforms, and
was further updated in January 2021. These changes introduced wide scale updates relating to sustainable
development, including references to certain parts of the United Nations’ SDGs, which may impact our operations
and strategy in this area. Other amendments to the NPPF that have been proposed relate to plan-makers being
required to align growth and infrastructure, improvements in the environment and the mitigation of climate change
(including by making effective use of land in urban areas) and adaption to its effects. The proposed changes to the
NPPF that concern design quality, new local Design Codes and new timescale policy for larger-scale
developments may cause some practical transitional difficulties, as councils, developers and local communities
grapple with the creation of new codes and procedures, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. Furthermore, the UK has recently completed a
‘Planning for the Future’ consultation, which could lead to significant changes to the planning process. The
ultimate aim of this consultation is to simplify the process for obtaining planning permission. However, the
introduction of new planning law would be subject to the interpretation and implementation of Local Authorities
which could introduce uncertainty into the process. The planning reform is currently being reviewed by the new
Secretary of State, which is likely to delay its introduction.

Additionally, there has been significant discussion in the media and among certain politicians in the UK
relating to “land banking,” a practice whereby a person or entity obtains land but does not develop it or develops
it many years after its purchase. Detractors of “land banking” argue that the practice contributes to inflated real
estate prices by limiting the amount of land available for sale in a given area. The Company can hold real estate
for long periods before obtaining planning permission, resolving technical constraints, developing the land and
selling it. While we do not believe we are engaged in “land banking,” as we generally seek to develop our sites
immediately once detailed planning consent and all conditions are discharged (subject to market conditions and
any legal or technical impediments), developing large sites requires an extended period of time and our
development plans sometimes include developing on a phased basis. Any change in legislation aimed at forcing
land owners to develop or sell their real estate holdings within certain prescribed periods (e.g. “use it or lose it”
policies) or which impose additional requirements or taxes on outline planning consents could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

In June 2021, the UK Government launched a new initiative called “First Homes” aimed at making home
ownership attainable for local people and key workers who are first-time buyers. This new tenure of home
ownership is expected to be incorporated into planning law in the near future and will become part of a local
authority’s affordable housing policy. This tenure of home ownership will allow people to purchase a home at a
minimum 30% discount to market value in perpetuity, subject to eligibility criteria. This requirement will be part
of the affordable housing obligations of a planning permission (Section 106 agreement) for a site and the costs
associated with it will be deducted from the land value. The same percentage discount must then be passed on
with the sale of the property to future buyers (who must also be first-time buyers). The initial sale must be at a
price no higher than £250,000 (or £420,000 in Greater London) after the discount has been applied. Changes made
to the planning system to support this initiative now require that First Homes properties should account for at least
25% of all affordable housing units delivered by developers through planning obligations. However, as this
initiative is in the early stages of implementation, the longer term impact of the initiative and any additional
changes made to the planning system in relation to it are not yet known.

**_Failure in our procedures, systems and internal controls, including with respect to due diligence and design,_**
**_could expose us to operational losses, contract and execution risk or violations of law and regulation._**

We develop a large number of sites simultaneously in different regions, which requires us to conduct a
large number of operations efficiently and accurately. These operations include, among other things, evaluating
the purchase of the site, conducting environmental, title and other due diligence investigations, designing the
layout and technical aspects of the development, sourcing consultants, materials and subcontractors and managing
subcontractors, contractual and statutory commitments. While we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that our
procedures, systems and controls are appropriate for our businesses, errors by employees, consultants or
subcontractors, failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements, failings or inadequacies in internal
control processes, material or equipment failures or natural disasters or the failure of external systems including
those of our suppliers or counterparties or statutory bodies, could result in operational losses that could adversely
impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and relationships with customers.


-----

In addition, our existing compliance processes and controls may not be sufficient to prevent or detect
non-compliance, wrongful practices, fraud and violations of law by our employees, contractors, customers,
intermediaries, consultants, joint venture partners or sales agents. We may have limited control over such parties’
actions due to the nature of the business relationship. If any such parties receive or grant inappropriate benefits or
engage in corrupt, fraudulent or other unfair or illegal business practices (including, without limitation, tax
evasion, fraudulent tax schemes, anticompetitive conduct, bribery, corruption, money laundering, modern slavery
or breaches of consumer protection laws), we could incur or become subject to significant financial losses, legal
sanctions, penalties, or reputational damage. In addition, we could lose relationships with public sector entities,
our partners (including public sector partners) and customers, and those parties may therefore be entitled to
terminate their contracts with us. In particular, as much of our business involves tendering for Government
contracts that are awarded on the basis of both financial and non-financial criteria (including compliance),
compliance issues may prejudice our ability to participate in or win such competitive bidding processes for a
significant period of time. See “—Our business depends in part on a strong image and reputation, and any
_negative impact on our image and reputation could adversely affect our business.” For example, in 2019/2020 we_
conducted a record keeping audit and review of the types of our development projects that qualify as “Estate
Agency Work” pursuant to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the
Payer) Regulations 2017 (the “Regulations”) and as a result require us to conduct Know Your Customer (“KYC”)
procedures for these activities in compliance with the Regulations. We reviewed our internal anti-money
laundering processes and procedures with the assistance of an outside adviser, and found that application of the
Regulations affected a wider range of development projects than originally envisaged and approximately a quarter
of developments projects at that time. Following the review, we made a series of changes to our internal policies
and procedures which included going beyond the requirements of the Regulations and expanding our KYC
procedures to all customers, of which we notified the HMRC in June 2020.

As we expand, we may also be exposed to new clients, suppliers and subcontractors. Although we have
longstanding relationships with many of our partners, there can be no guarantee that our systems and procedures
will insulate us from errors in site valuations, failure to identify material issues in the due diligence process or
errors in the design process (including those that result in failure to comply with statutory or regulatory
requirements).

Additionally, any delay in responding to changes in these laws and regulations, particularly in light of
evolving standards and potential new implementing legislation, may result in penalties for non-compliance with
relevant regulatory requirements. Monitoring and ensuring best practices for our risk management and internal
controls may become increasingly expensive for us in the future, and such risks may be more acute when we
undertake larger-scale projects or during periods of intense activity.

Our internal controls and procedures, policies and our risk management systems may be unable to
adequately address all such risks of non-compliance, which could have a material negative impact on our
reputation, business activities, financial position and results of operations.

**_Our rights in the plots of land that comprise our land pipeline may be limited and we may be subject to_**
**_uncertainties associated with the land contracts we enter into as part of our business._**

Our rights in the plots comprising our land pipeline are generally split into three categories: (i) those sites
and plots for which we have legally completed the deal, (ii) sites and plots that are held under contract (often a
conditional contract), and (iii) those for which we have been appointed preferred developer by the land vendor,
but which have not yet progressed to contract. Our legal interest in the sites in our land pipeline can take the form
of a freehold interest in the land or alternatively take the form of a development lease or license (which provides
us with development rights and exclusivity). On sites where our legal interest takes the form of a development
lease or license and we have defaulted on that site, we could be forced to forfeit our development rights and
exclusivity over that site, retaining no residual interest in the land. Conversely, traditional housebuilders that buy
their sites and plots with an upfront land payment typically receive the freehold interest in a site, which they retain
until the individual homes are sold.

Through our partnership-focused business model, we enter into a variety of arrangements in order to
access plots for development, including conditional land purchase contracts, development agreements,
overarching framework agreements, leases and building licenses. Under conditional land purchase contracts, our
obligation to purchase the land is generally subject to the receipt of planning consent that is acceptable to us. As
there is uncertainty regarding whether the conditions in such contracts will be satisfied, and the timing thereof,
these commitments are not recognized as liabilities on our balance sheet unless or until the applicable
conditionality is removed or it becomes reasonably likely (in our estimate) that we may receive the requisite


-----

planning consents and satisfy the necessary conditions. To the extent such contracts become unconditional, we
will need to commit funds to complete such purchases.

Additionally, the plots in our land pipeline over which we hold title are often the subject of security,
including legal charges or parent company guarantees granted in favor of the vendor to secure the performance of
our obligations under a development agreement. Similarly, for the majority of plots in our land pipeline, our only
rights in such plots are those granted pursuant to comprehensive development/framework agreements that we
enter into with vendors (which do not confer rights to proceed with development without a separate development
agreement). Accordingly, in the event that we fail to deliver a scheme or otherwise breach our obligations under
our development agreements, our vendors may enforce their security or terminate our rights under such
agreements. Any extinguishment of rights in the plots in our land pipeline may have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_Changes in privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to interact effectively with third parties._**

We currently hold, and have previously held, personal data on a variety of parties, including suppliers,
employees, future employees, building users, subcontractors or potential subcontractors and customers or
potential customers who acquire or seek to acquire houses from us. We have engaged, and expect to continue
engaging, in various direct marketing activities to source customers to buy our housing units. As a result, we are
subject to data protection legislation (including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679), as it forms
part of the law of the United Kingdom by virtue of the EUWA (the “GDPR”)) and the UK Data Protection Act
2018 (the “UK Data Protection Act”). Non-compliance with the GDPR or UK Data Protection Act, or technical
defects resulting in a leak or the misuse of such data, could result in damage to our reputation and otherwise harm
our business.

The GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018, and was immediately binding across all Member
States of the EU, is a privacy regime regarding the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of
personal data and the free movement of such data. The GDPR requires companies that process personal data about
EU subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations
related to, for example, (i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy,
storage limitation, security and confidentiality; (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with
such principles (accountability); (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing; and (iv) the
rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, a right of access, the right to rectification and the
right to erasure.

The GDPR requires companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and
document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies or
types of data. Although we have implemented measures to comply with the GDPR, we cannot ensure that we
remain fully compliant with its obligations under the GDPR. Non-compliance may be met with significant
penalties including fines of up to 4% of total annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher),
depending on the type and severity of the breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures
that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease processing). Compliance with the
GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business and the failure to
comply with these laws could subject us to significant fines and sanctions. In addition, we do not currently have
specific data security insurance coverage and cannot guarantee that our general liability insurance coverage will
be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data security systems. Should one or more
of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and/or prospects.

**_Adverse consequences could occur as a result of changes in tax law or uncertainties in the interpretation and_**
**_application thereof or as a result of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) challenging our tax_**
**_treatment of certain matters._**

Tax rules, including stamp duty land tax provisions and their interpretation, may change, and new taxes
may be introduced, such as the additional stamp duty recently imposed on second homes. Furthermore,
uncertainties can arise as a result of differences in interpretation or application of existing tax law. Any change in
our tax status, in taxation legislation or its interpretation, or in HMRC practice, could affect the value of property
we hold, the average selling price of homes, potential sales and post-tax returns. References in this Offering
Memorandum concerning taxation are based upon current tax law and practice that are subject to change, possibly
with retrospective effect. Any such change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and/or prospects.


-----

Due to the size and scope of our business, there are a number of matters that HMRC might examine in
detail for any given year. Our potential exposure and the likelihood of HMRC raising a challenge in connection
with any matters is difficult to assess. If HMRC successfully challenges any matters or if other potential tax
matters result in unfavorable outcomes, additional tax liabilities and adverse publicity may follow, which may
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_Any inability to obtain additional surety bonds could limit our future growth._**

We are often required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance under construction contracts,
development agreements and other arrangements. As of July 31, 2021, we had £18.2 million in surety bonds and
£74.9 million of infrastructure bonds outstanding. We have obtained facilities to provide the requisite volume of
surety bonds to meet our current needs, and currently have substantial headroom under those facilities. However,
further growth may require that we obtain additional surety facilities. Our ability to obtain additional surety bonds,
whether from the NHBC or other providers of bond lines, primarily depends upon our financial rating, past
performance, management expertise and the capacity of the surety market. For example, when negotiating
additional surety bonds with the NHBC, consideration is given to the number of plot registrations completed over
the prior four-year period, the group’s rating with the NHBC and the ability to demonstrate how existing bonds
are being managed and released in a timely way (for example, bonds covering roads and sewers works on site are
released when they are progressed towards adoption by the Local Authority highways department and water utility
companies).

A number of factors could limit our ability to obtain appropriate levels of performance bond coverage,
including (i) our ability to maintain our current “premium” NHBC rating (ii) changes to our claims record (iii)
any changes to surety providers’ requirements or policies (iv) the failure of a surety company, particularly where
we cannot get the necessary consent from the issuer’s lenders, and (v) the market’s capacity to provide bonds
sufficient for our growth, which was restricted from 2008 to 2011, when surety bonds in the UK became difficult
to obtain and their costs increased as a result of the financial crisis. The occurrence of any of these events could
affect our ability to compete effectively for new work and may have an adverse impact on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_We have in the past sold, and in the future may sell, certain of our homes to customers with a leasehold instead_**
**_of a freehold interest, and any potential changes to our current legal regime regarding leasehold properties,_**
**_including any retrospective application of new laws or regulations, could have an adverse effect on our_**
**_business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects._**

We usually sell our homes as freeholds. However, we have in the past sold, and in the future may sell,
certain homes as leaseholds. With a freehold property, the buyer acquires the building and the land on which it
stands. With a leasehold property, the buyer only acquires the lease from the freeholder for a fixed period of time,
often between 90 and 999 years. After the lease expires, the buyer has no further legal interest in the property.
Leaseholders are typically required to pay annual ground rent to the freeholder of the land on which the property
sits. Additionally, with the sale of apartments customers will also have to pay a service charge for maintenance of
common areas. Dependent on how much of the communal space (green areas) on a development site is adopted
for maintenance by a local authority, a customer may also have to contribute to an estate service charge on
maintained parts of the overall development. In addition, leaseholders may face restrictions in relation to, or need
to receive permission before, making certain changes to the property over and above estate restrictions, with
permission fees being payable as a result. Furthermore, the leaseholder may be required to pay fees upon the
occurrence of certain events. We sold 4% and 5% of our homes as leaseholds in the financial years ended October
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result of Government’s changes to the current Help to Buy scheme, for a
customer to be eligible to use the scheme all houses must be sold freehold and only apartments can be sold
leasehold, with the lease terms being customer and not freeholder focused. We are now selling houses freehold
on all of our sites, with the small number of apartments we sell being leasehold.

Following concerns about the fairness, clarity and presentation of some leasehold contract terms in the
consumer sector (which could lead to people incurring unanticipated costly fees over a long period or having to
abide by onerous terms), the Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”) launched an investigation in June
2019 to determine whether purchasers are being treated fairly when buying a leasehold home. The investigation
examined two key areas: (1) potential mis-selling, which examines whether individuals who have bought a
leasehold property are given the information they need to fully understand the obligations they are taking on
(including, for example, the requirement to pay ground rent over a certain period of time, or whether they have an
accurate understanding of their ability to buy their freehold); and (2) potential unfair terms, which examines


-----

whether individuals are having to pay excessive fees due to unfair contract terms (including, for example,
administration, service and “permission” charges and ground rents that double after a certain period of time).

In connection with this investigation, the CMA wrote to certain companies across the UK home building
sector (including certain developers, lenders and freeholders – but not Keepmoat) asking for information to better
understand about how leaseholds are sold and managed, and the terms their contracts contain. Following the
CMA’s review of the material provided by market participants, the CMA issued an updated report in February
2020, highlighting their key areas of concern in relation to leasehold sales. These areas included: (1) ground rent,
both in terms of the method of increase (in particular doubling ground rents but also increases by reference to the
retail price index); (2) the impact that ground rent increases might have by virtue of the 1988 Housing Act (as
arrear of ground rent could become grounds for a mandatory possession order); (3) the mis-selling of leasehold
houses (in particular in relation to a lack of information or the stage at which that information was provided); (4)
the level of permission and consent fees; and (5) deficiencies in checks and balances in the sales process to protect
customers.

On September 4, 2020, the CMA opened cases against certain companies in the UK housebuilding sector
(which did not include Keepmoat) in respect of possible breaches of consumer protection law in the residential
leasehold sector. These cases were based on possible instances of mis-selling and potential unfairness of certain
leasehold contract terms. On March 19, 2021, the CMA issued consultation letters to two of those companies in
relation to possible breaches of consumer protection law in the residential leasehold sector. The letters outlined
the CMA’s specific concerns regarding the potential unfairness of terms that double ground rent every 10 or 15
years and asked the developers to take steps to address this point.

The Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Bill, which was introduced by the Government on May 12, 2021,
will eliminate the charging of ground rents on new long residential leases and introduce civil penalties for
freeholders that do not comply with this legislation. Under the bill, the Government will reform the process of
enfranchisement valuation leaseholders must follow to calculate the cost of extending their lease or buying their
freehold. The Government will abolish marriage value (being the increase in the value of the property following
the completion of the lease extension, reflecting the additional market value of the longer lease), cap the treatment
of ground rents at 0.1% of the freehold value and prescribe rates for the calculations at market value. The
Government will also introduce an online calculator, further simplifying the process for leaseholds and ensuring
standardization and fairness for all those looking to enfranchise. The Government’s leasehold reform proposals,
when implemented, will only apply in England, although existing legislation does currently apply in both Wales
and England. Scotland operates a separate regime for interdependent units as there are very few leasehold
properties in Scotland.

Any potential changes to the current regime regarding leasehold properties, including any retrospective
application or any breach of consumer protection laws by the business in respect of leasehold properties, could
have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_The net realizable value of our build work-in-progress (“WIP”) and land may decline._**

There is an inherent risk that the net realizable value of our build WIP and land, which constitute part of
our inventory and secured land pipeline, respectively, may decline. As a result of our partnership model, we
typically do not hold large land banks for long periods of time awaiting development, and instead have invested
significantly in relatively lower value brownfield sites (which represented 73% and 72% of our legal completions
in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 and the nine months ended July 31, 2021, respectively). However,
we, like other home builders, are nevertheless subject to the risk of declining values. The valuation of a property
development project or land is inherently subjective due to the individual nature of each property and is influenced
by a number of factors. Changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws (including in relation to building
regulations, taxation, mortgage availability and planning), political and economic conditions, the condition of
financial markets, the financial condition of customers, tax regimes and interest and inflation rate fluctuations all
mean that valuations are subject to uncertainty and adverse macroeconomic events and other unforeseen events
could result in write-downs of our build WIP and land. There can be no assurance that the net realizable value of
land in our financial statements, including the historical financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum, will reflect the actual sale prices achieved of either the land itself or any developments built
thereon.

Land parcels, building lots and housing inventories are illiquid assets, meaning that they may not be
easily sold and converted into cash and that any sale may not be capable of being completed quickly without


-----

accepting a lower price than may be otherwise offered, and we may not be able to dispose of them efficiently or
at all if the Group or the housing market and general economy are in financial distress.

If any of the risks described above were to materialize, they could adversely affect the value of our land
or developments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and/or prospects.

**_Ownership, leasing or occupation of land as well as home building carries potential environmental risks and_**
**_liabilities, including liability under claims for damages as a result of use of hazardous materials, including_**
**_asbestos._**

Environmental legislation imposes strict and retrospective liability for cleaning up contaminated land,
watercourses or groundwater on the person causing or knowingly permitting the contamination in circumstances
where such contamination is causing, or where there is a significant possibility of it causing, significant harm to
people or the environment. As a result, we may be liable for the costs of investigation, remediation or removal of
hazardous or toxic substances located on, under or in a property that we currently or formerly owned, leased or
occupied, irrespective of whether we caused or knew of the pollution. The impact of such laws, regulations and
policies can vary greatly from site to site, depending on, among other things, the scope of work undertaken, the
site’s environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site. Environmental laws, regulations and
policies may give rise to substantial compliance or remediation costs and requirements, and delay, prohibit or
severely restrict development at our sites. We also could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines,
penalties and third party claims for personal injury or property damage as a result of violations of, or liabilities
under, such laws, regulations and policies.

We routinely acquire properties on the basis that we accept all contamination risk associated with the
property, and often provide vendors with indemnities covering any liabilities which the vendor may face under
environmental laws following the sale. The costs associated with the management of such substances, or the costs
of defending against environmental claims may be substantial, and our recourse to the contractors that perform
our remediation work may be restricted by contractual limitations, the lapse of time or the insolvency of such
contractors, among other factors. The presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate such substances
properly, may also adversely affect our ability to sell the land or, where relevant, borrow using the land as security.

As a substantial proportion of the Group’s developments are on brownfield sites, we are subject to an
increased risk that some of our development projects are located on land that may have been contaminated or
rendered geologically unstable by previous use.

For example, at our Nightingale Road site, where we plan to build 372 homes in partnership with the
Derby Council, a report prepared for councilors warned that land contamination could affect the project’s financial
viability and completion date. The report classified the risk as “moderate risk (remediation works to be
completed).” We are currently in the process of remediating the site under license with independent competent
consultants monitoring the work being undertaken. It is expected that following completion and verification of
the remediation in accordance with the planning permission (including remediation strategy), the site will be
classed as having been remediated to the high standard required for the sale of residential homes. However, if the
site is not classed as having been remediated to such standard, we would be obliged to undertake remedial work
to address any defective work.

Although we aim to carry out appropriate due diligence before acquiring properties, any deficiencies in
our due diligence process could result in our failure to identify all major constraints and risks. In addition,
following legal transfer of the land to us, we bear public liability risk as well as associated maintenance and health,
safety and environmental risks. Contaminants resulting from historical operations have been detected at some of
our development sites, one of which was the Nightingale Road site. This is not unusual for brownfield sites and
as such, our business approach is to acquire these sites and remediate them to the standard required for residential
development. Although we do not currently expect any remedial obligations to have a material effect on our
financial condition, we could incur substantial additional costs as a result of additional contamination that is
identified or additional obligations that are imposed at these or other sites in the future. We are particularly
susceptible to this risk where historical off-site migration of contamination has occurred prior to our acquisition
of a site, which has not otherwise been identified as part of the legal or technical due diligence process. Laws and
regulations may also impose liability for the release of certain materials from land into the air or water, including
asbestos, and such release can form the basis for liability to third persons for personal injury or other damages. It
is unlikely that such claims would be fully or partially covered by our present or future insurance. See “—We may
_be subject to increases in insurance premiums or fail to secure or maintain adequate insurance coverage.”_


-----

As a home building business with a wide variety of development related activities, we could be liable for
future claims for damages as a result of our past or present use of hazardous or potentially unsafe materials
(including materials that are not currently deemed unsafe but in the future may become known to be hazardous or
unsafe). When beginning work at a site, we are exposed to the risk of various liabilities, including negligent and
non-negligent damage to third party assets, local planning violations and health, safety and environmental
incidents. For example, when we enter a site, we may inadvertently damage third party assets such as underground
cables, sewers or pipes on a negligent or non-negligent basis. For example, certain work site vibrations may affect
properties nearby and certain excavation procedures may cause collapses on third party land. We have also been
subject to claims in which our former employees, employees of our subcontractors and third parties have
successfully claimed damages in relation to hazardous materials and other environmental and health and safety
matters. Although we carry third party liability insurance where we are responsible for policy excess only on
covered claims, and to date no claims have been declined by insurers, there can be no guarantee that additional
claims will not result in significant costs or that they will be covered by insurance in the future.

Historically, asbestos was used as a building material by the construction industry and exposure to
asbestos and inhalation of asbestos fibers can lead to a number of diseases. Although we have not been subject to
any claims of this nature to date, if claims related to exposure to asbestos arise at any of our sites, such claims
could give rise to material liabilities.

The occurrence of any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_If we fail to successfully implement our business strategy or engage in future activities where we have limited_**
**_expertise, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects may be adversely affected._**

Our business strategy is based on a series of projections and estimates predicated on the occurrence of
future events, which may or may not take place, including the execution of certain operational and organizational
initiatives by our management team. Our ability to successfully implement our strategy is dependent upon a
number of business, economic and competitive uncertainties and other factors that are outside our control.
Accordingly, our strategy is based upon a number of assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. We cannot
provide assurance that the assumptions underlying our business strategy are correct, and any inaccurate
assumption may result in variations of our strategy that may limit our ability to achieve our envisaged goals. In
addition, we are unable to provide any assurance that: (i) our actions will generate the expected positive economic
results; (ii) our business strategy can be successfully implemented by management; and (iii) we will be able to
achieve the revenue, ROCE, ASP and cash targets set out in our strategy within the expected time frame. If our
results differ significantly from those expected based on our strategies and our business plan, this could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

We may undertake activities outside of the current scope of our expertise or regional operations. If we
expand the scope of our business activities pursuant to our regional expansion program and general business plan,
we may have insufficient knowledge of the appropriate processes, systems and controls to deliver appropriate
returns. In addition, to the extent that we expand or invest in areas that are outside of our existing lines of business,
we will face new challenges, which may include:

      - our ability to develop the expertise required to successfully engage in such businesses and to
make such businesses successful;

      - our ability to develop a reputation in industries into which we may expand;

      - our ability to attract and retain customers, suppliers and managers for new businesses;

      - our ability to control costs across a more complex regional or operational footprint; and

      - competition from companies engaged in similar businesses in the markets we have targeted for
entry.

Furthermore, to the extent such investments are undertaken as joint ventures, there can be no assurance
that our public and private partners will meet their joint venture obligations in a timely manner or at all. Any of
these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or
prospects.


-----

**_Our business plan relies on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly-skilled, competent people at all_**
**_levels._**

Our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of our Executive Directors and senior
management team (and in particular, our Land and Partnerships Team), who have significant experience in the
home building and regeneration industries and have developed strong reputations and relationships among those
with whom we do business. The overall management of our business and the development of our projects, culture
and strategic direction depend in large part on our ability to retain these key personnel. We do not maintain key
man insurance, and if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel or develop a succession plan for senior
management, we may not be able to maintain our standards of service or continue to grow as anticipated.

Additionally, skilled employees working in the home building industry are highly sought after and there
may sometimes be shortages of skilled employees, particularly in periods of increased market activity. Failure to
attract and retain such personnel in sufficient capacities and capabilities, or to ensure that their experience and
knowledge is not lost when they leave the business through resignation or retirement, may have a material adverse
effect on standards of service and our ability to meet our key strategic targets. See “—Our business depends on
_the continued availability, viability and cost of subcontractors and other service providers.”_

The loss of any member of our senior management team or the inability to attract and retain skilled
employees generally may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition
and/or prospects.

**_Our business depends in part on our strong image and reputation, and any negative impact on our image and_**
**_reputation could adversely affect our business._**

Our image and reputation represent an important part of our business, especially given the nature of our
partnership business model and our target customer base. We often partner with Local Authorities and other public
bodies, including Homes England, which require us to participate in public procurement processes. Non-financial
criteria, such as planning and design capability, customer service records, past delivery of high-quality homes
with minimal defects, delivery capacity and proposals to address social and economic sustainability issues,
typically account for more than 50% of an applicant’s score in public procurement processes. As a result,
maintaining the reputation of our business is central to our success.

Our local management teams can, to some extent, independently organize their own advertising
campaigns and marketing initiatives to supplement our national campaigns. Our local teams could therefore
project an image that is not aligned with our Group strategy, which could dilute the Group’s image and have a
material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. We may also
unknowingly source materials from suppliers that have produced or procured such materials in an illegal or
unethical manner, which may adversely affect our reputation and financial position. We may also be the subject
of adverse publicity, for example, if home purchasers were to generate negative publicity related to the quality of
the homes that we build. Such adverse publicity could be disseminated more widely through the use of the internet
and social media platforms. Additionally, we could be the subject of adverse publicity from local communities
who object to our developments. There can be no assurance that our efforts to liaise with local communities
regarding building plans and to maintain our reputation for being a trusted partner will be successful, and a decline
in our public perception may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and/or prospects.

**_Home building is subject to the risk of construction defects, which may give rise to contractual or other_**
**_liabilities or legal disputes._**

We are subject to the risk of construction defects and are currently, and may in the future become,
involved in litigation, claims and disputes arising in connection with poor materials and manufactured items
provided by suppliers, inadequate designs by consultants, actual or alleged defects in the work we or our
subcontractors perform, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements (including safety and
environmental laws and regulations), and other types of claims, including challenges relating to planning
permissions and other Local Authority approvals. In the ordinary course of business, we are also exposed to
National House Building Council (“NHBC”) and other warranty and indemnity claims (which may not be subject
to monetary caps or other contractual limitations) during applicable defects liability periods (which can exceed
ten years in some cases). We may be required to incur substantial expenditures to defend such claims and, in the
case of successful claims, to rectify the defects, and may have to forego payments to which we would otherwise
be entitled.


-----

For a period of time following the legal completion of a sale, we are generally obliged to rectify any
defects found in the home to bring it up to the standards required under the technical specifications set out in the
home warranty deed. These defects are typically small and take a short time to resolve. However, in some cases,
there may be a significant number of defects due to poor design, workmanship or materials which may require a
longer period of time to resolve. In some cases, the presence of these defects may require the customer to move
out of their new home and into temporary accommodation while work is being carried out by our employees or
subcontractors. Any significant increase in such cases could increase our costs and damage our reputation, and
we may face liability for defective work.

Construction defects may arise sometime after the completion of a particular project or contract, and,
although we seek to obtain contractual warranty, guarantee or indemnity protection in our contracts with designers,
contractors, subcontractors and suppliers, we may not be able to obtain this protection in all cases. We have
professional indemnity insurance which covers claims made against us and third party losses incurred due to our
negligence or the negligence of our professional designers. As is typical in the new-build industry, our homes
come with either a ten-year NHBC comprehensive warranty and insurance policy or a ten-year Local Authority
Building Control (“LABC”) insurance policy for the benefit of the customer covering structural defects, improper
environmental remediation and waterproofing. In both cases, we pay the premiums for these policies. Customers
may access NHBC or LABC new home warranties if construction defects are discovered in their home. The
NHBC and/or LABC, as applicable, may seek to recover from us any losses paid to such customers through the
indemnity in the Homes Warranty Deed and our insurance may not cover such defects or losses or cover them
fully or at all.

We have a premium rating with both the NHBC and LABC. If we were to deliver homes of a substandard
quality over a period of time, or if multiple customers were to make claims against our warranties or policies, our
rating could be affected and premiums increased.

When we are liable to pay fines or damages as a result of work or materials provided by our suppliers or
subcontractors, we may seek to recoup those amounts. However, our suppliers or subcontractors may be unable
to fund these amounts or may have gone out of business in the period since construction. In such cases, we could
be liable for the full statutory limitation period. Significant liabilities for which we are responsible may not be
identified or may only come to light after the expiry of contractual warranty, guarantee or indemnity periods. Any
claims relating to defects arising on a development attributable to us may give rise to contractual or other liabilities
which can extend, depending on the relevant contractual or statutory provisions, for a number of years following
the completion of the project or contract. Unexpected levels of expenditure attributable to defects (including those
caused by third parties) arising on a project may have a material adverse effect on the return generated by a
particular project or contract and our overall performance. Furthermore, widespread or significant defects could
generate significant adverse publicity and have a negative impact on our reputation and key relationships, as well
as on our ability to sell housing and acquire new land, and divert financial and management resources from more
beneficial uses.

**_Our business in Scotland may be adversely impacted in the event that a Scottish referendum votes for_**
**_independence._**

In the event that Scotland declares independence from the UK in any future referendum on the subject,
the uncertainties and impact of Scottish independence could significantly impact our Scottish business and
operations. Although a majority of voters in the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014 voted
against independence, it is possible that a new referendum in the future would lead to a different voting outcome.
The pursuit of a further referendum on Scottish independence is the stated policy of the current Scottish
government.

The details of any changes as a result of Scottish independence are impossible to predict, and are likely
to depend on post-referendum negotiations and agreements between the Scottish Government and other
organizations at UK and EU level. If there were a vote in favor of independence, it could lead to a range of effects
which could be negative to our business in Scotland including increased costs and taxation rates in Scotland, a
decrease in investment in the housing sector in Scotland and a decrease in the demand for housing. In addition, as
a result of Scottish independence, our operations in Scotland could be subject to changes in the monetary system,
currency, and other regulatory and legal frameworks. For the financial year ended October 31, 2020, we derived
less than 10% of our revenues from our Scotland region.

In the event that any of these effects materialize, they could have an adverse effect on our overall
business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_We have in the past engaged in acquisitions and as part of our growth strategy expect to consider further_**
**_strategic opportunities from time to time that may involve acquisitions, dispositions, investments in joint_**
**_ventures, partnerships, and other strategic alternatives, any of which may result in the use of a significant_**
**_amount of our management resources or significant costs, and we may not be able to fully realize the potential_**
**_benefit of such transactions._**

In connection with our regional expansion program and general business plan, we have made, and may
continue to make, acquisitions, dispositions, investments in joint ventures, partnerships, and other strategic
alternatives. For example, in 2017, we acquired MCI, a developer of social housing projects for Local Authorities
and other Registered Providers. Our management may from time to time be engaged in evaluating such potential
transactions, investments and other strategic alternatives. Although these activities or discussions may not result
in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction, we may incur significant costs or devote a
significant amount of management resources to analyzing and pursuing such transactions, which could negatively
impact our operations.

In cases where acquisitions are completed, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate
expected margins or cash flows, or to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including growth or
expected synergies. There can be no assurance that our assessment of and assumptions regarding acquisition
targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. In
addition, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully. The integration of acquired businesses and
assets may require more investment than we expect, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated
liabilities or contingencies with respect to customers, employees, suppliers, Government authorities or other
parties, which may impact our operating results. See also “—Ownership, leasing or occupation of land as well as
_home building carries potential environmental risks and liabilities, including liability under claims for damages_
_as a result of use of hazardous materials, including asbestos.” The process of integrating businesses may be_
disruptive to our operations and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such operations or a
decrease in our results of operations as a result of difficulties or risks, including:

      - unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual and other issues;

      - difficulty in standardizing information and other systems;

      - difficulty in realizing operating synergies;

      - diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business;

      - failure to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided; and

      - potential loss of key employees and cultural challenges associated with integrating employees.

Moreover, any acquisition may result in the incurrence of additional debt, which would increase our
leverage and could reduce our profitability and harm our business. While we may seek protection (for example,
through warranties and indemnities in the case of acquisitions), significant liabilities may not be identified in due
diligence or may come to light after the expiry of warranty or indemnity periods. Additionally, while we may seek
to limit our ongoing exposure (for example, through liability caps and period limits on warranties and indemnities
in the case of disposals), such warranties and indemnities may be insufficient and we may incur unexpected and
significant liabilities. See “—If we fail to successfully implement our business strategy or engage in future
_activities where we have limited expertise, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or_
_prospects may be adversely affected.” Any claims arising in the future may have a material adverse effect on our_
business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

If any of our acquisitions fail to perform in accordance with our assumptions, any goodwill or other
intangible assets associated with the acquisition could be subject to impairment and reduce our profitability and
net assets accordingly.

It is also possible that we may, from time to time, seek to divest certain businesses. For example, in 2017,
pursuant to our strategy to focus exclusively on housing development, we sold our contracting arm, Keepmoat
Regeneration Limited, to ENGIE, a French multinational group. In connection with any proposed divestments,
we may fail to find a buyer at an acceptable price and/or may divert management’s attention from other matters.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the anticipated benefits of a proposed disposal will be realized and there
may be other unanticipated or unintended effects.

**_Interruption or failure of, or cyber-attacks on, our IT systems and data protection systems may result in a_**
**_significant loss of control of our business information functions and operations._**

The efficient operation and management of our business depends in part on the proper operation,
performance and development of our IT systems and processes, in particular those relating to customer and
employee information, confidential business and financial information, surveying and valuation. We routinely
transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means and
therefore rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of such information. Our financial, accounting,
data processing, IT, communications or other systems and facilities, and/or third party infrastructure on which the
we rely may: (i) fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond
our control; and (ii) be vulnerable to unauthorized access and data loss (from within the organization or by third
parties), computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware attacks, cyber threats that have a security impact, and the
interception or misuse of information transmitted or received by them. Where the collation of data has been
centralized within a business function, it is more likely that a data protection breach would result in the loss of a
large amount of data. See “—Changes in privacy laws could adversely affect the Group’s ability to interact
_effectively with third parties.”_

Although we have implemented data security provisions that we believe are appropriate, particularly in
respect of our centralized IT function, breaches may nonetheless occur, resulting in the loss of our customers’
confidential and other information, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the
operations of our customers or third parties. Any such breaches could lead to a loss of control over critical business
information and/or systems (such as contract costs, invoicing, payroll management and/or internal reporting),
resulting in an adverse impact on our ability to operate effectively or to fulfil our contractual or regulatory
obligations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify these protective measures
or to investigate and remedy vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation, reputational
harm and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance that we
maintain. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and/or prospects.

Additionally, from time to time, we may implement new or upgraded IT systems. The implementation
of new IT systems could distract management from other critical business operations. Issues may be experienced
during the implementation of new IT systems, which may lead to increased costs and may result in errors in
operations, including the planning of projects. Our failure to properly implement new IT systems may also impact
our ability to properly report our financial performance or comply with other regulatory requirements. Any of the
foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or
prospects.

**_We may be subject to increases in insurance premiums or fail to secure or maintain adequate insurance_**
**_coverage._**

We retain insurance policies that provide coverage at a level that we believe is appropriate against risks
commonly insured in our industry. Our insurance policies cover contract works, professional indemnity, property,
employer liability, directors and officers, pension trustee, public liability, business interruption and money,
terrorism, motor vehicles, engineering and computer liability. We also obtain title defect insurance if considered
appropriate following the carrying out of due diligence on a development site. As only a limited number of insurers
offer coverage of this type, we may not be able to avoid increases in premiums. Furthermore, as insurance
providers review the terms and conditions of our insurance policies on a periodic basis, we may not be able to
obtain the same or similar coverage in the future and certain types of risks may be, or may become, either
uninsurable or not economically insurable. This could increase our exposure to various risks and related costs,
which in turn could have an adverse impact on our business, profitability and growth.

We have not retained insurance policies for certain types of risks, including risks associated with criminal
liability and radioactive contamination. Our financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected if we
suffer damages or losses or if we are exposed to liability over risks for which we have no insurance coverage or
insufficient insurance coverage. See “—We may suffer losses from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, war,
_sabotage, social unrest, corruption and other unforeseen events outside our control, and such losses may be_
_uninsured or in excess of insurance proceeds.”_


-----

**_We may suffer losses from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, war, sabotage, social unrest, corruption and_**
**_other unforeseen events outside our control, and such losses may be uninsured or in excess of insurance_**
**_proceeds._**

Our assets and projects are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and other catastrophic events
outside our control, including ice and wind storms, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, power loss,
telecommunications failures, network software flaws, social unrest, sabotage, war, acts of vandalism, arson,
terrorism, theft and fuel shortages. The occurrence of any such events could directly affect our project sites or,
more broadly, the UK economy or housing market.

Any damage or destruction to our assets (including our land pipeline, development projects and major
office or administrative facilities) as a result of these or other events could impact our ability to sell homes to our
customers or continue our business plans. In addition, if we are unable to sell homes to our customers or continue
our property development projects as a result of these or other events, we could lose our current customers,
contracts or projects. Such events may increase costs, decrease demand for our homes and result in other losses
that may not be insured and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and/or prospects.

We could suffer physical damage to property or liabilities as a result of the foregoing risks, resulting in
losses that may not be fully or partially covered by our insurance. In addition, certain types of risks may be, or
may become in the future, either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may not be currently or in the
future covered by our insurance policies. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we
could sustain financial loss or lose capital invested in affected property as well as anticipated future income from
that property. In addition, we could be liable to repair damage or meet liabilities caused by uninsured risks. We
would likely also remain liable for any debt or other financial obligation related to the affected property. No
assurance can be given that material losses or liabilities in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the
future.

**_We are exposed to risks in connection with corporate and contractual joint ventures, other associated_**
**_companies and special purpose vehicles where we do not have sole operational control._**

Although joint ventures are not one of our key areas of focus, in certain cases our partners require that
we set up joint ventures to facilitate delivery of specific schemes. These requirements are most common when
working with Local Authorities on large-scale projects that involve multiple phases. For the financial year ended
October 31, 2020, our consolidated revenue from joint venture companies amounted to £1.0 million. As of July
31, 2021, we had also provided loans totaling £9.8 million to joint ventures and associated companies in which
we held less than 100% of the shares. Parent company guarantees have also been provided in some cases in respect
of the obligations of joint ventures, with prior consideration given to our level of control over compliance with
such obligations. In the future, we may also enter into further joint ventures or make investments or acquire
participations in associated companies or special purpose vehicles.

Joint ventures often require that we and our partners obtain or procure financing in furtherance of the
joint venture’s operations. If one of our joint ventures or partners are unable to obtain financing when required,
we may be forced to make up the financial shortfall from our own resources, which could result in additional costs
or delays to the development. Conversely, if we are unable to meet our obligations under our joint venture
agreements, our partners may be able to terminate our involvement in the relevant joint venture.

To finance the activities of our joint ventures, our joint ventures, associated companies and special
purpose vehicles may obtain loans from third party lenders, or issue bonds or other debt instruments, that are
secured by the joint venture’s assets. In certain instances, we and our other partners in a joint venture may also
provide guarantees and indemnities to lenders with respect to the joint venture’s debt, which may be triggered
under certain conditions when the joint venture fails to fulfil its obligations under its loan agreements and debt
instruments.

Our ability to fully extract the strategic potential in markets where we operate through joint ventures,
associated companies and special purpose vehicles may be impaired if we are unable to agree with our joint
venture partners or joint shareholders on a strategy or its implementation. The interests of our joint venture
partners or joint shareholders could conflict with our interests or the interests of the holders of the Notes. Minority
shareholders in certain joint ventures and associated companies may also have approval or other rights under
applicable corporate law or the applicable joint venture agreement, shareholder agreement or other organizational
document. The interests of these minority shareholders may differ from our economic interests and may prevent


-----

us from pursuing our preferred business strategy with the relevant subsidiary. Our ability to implement
organizational measures and pursue our preferred financial policies (in particular, dividend policies, capital
expenditure plans and allocation of company assets) may also be impeded.

Where we hold non-controlling interests in companies and joint ventures, we may not be able to influence
the decision making process on certain key matters or may need to obtain the consent of other shareholders or
joint venture participants. We may therefore depend on the cooperation of other shareholders or participants to
carry out the business and affairs of those companies or joint ventures and ensure that the company or joint venture,
as well as the shareholders or participants, fulfil their respective obligations to us and to third parties. If the other
shareholders or participants do not provide such cooperation or fulfil these obligations due to their financial
condition, strategic business interests (which may be contrary to ours) or other reasons, we may be required to
spend additional resources (including payments under the guarantees we have provided to the joint ventures’
lenders) and suffer losses, each of which could be significant. For example, under the terms of certain of our joint
development agreements, we may be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of our joint venture partners
in the event they become insolvent or otherwise fail to perform their obligations. Moreover, our ability to recoup
such expenditures and losses by exercising remedies against our partners may be limited due to potential legal
defenses they may have, their respective financial condition and other circumstances.

We may have disputes with our joint venture partners and may not be able to resolve all the issues that
arise with respect to such disputes, despite procedures dictated by the joint venture agreement. Such disputes may
lead to delays in the development and completion of the project, or the project being developed in such a way that
will not achieve its highest potential rate of return. In addition, we may accept risks or responsibilities in the course
of our joint venture operations that exceed those which we would typically be prepared to accept.

In addition, under certain conditions our joint venture partners or joint shareholders could (i) terminate
or refuse to extend contractual relationships, (ii) exercise option rights to acquire or sell interests in our joint
ventures (especially through the exercise of “deadlock” provisions to the extent contained in the underlying joint
venture or shareholder agreement), or (iii) otherwise influence the day-to-day business of our joint ventures or
other associated companies or special purpose vehicles. Upon dissolution or termination of a joint venture we may
be required to make payments to our partners in the joint venture, and such payments could be significant.
Furthermore, we could be subject to fiduciary or contractual obligations to our joint venture partners or joint
shareholders, which could prevent or impede our ability to unilaterally expand in the business area in which that
joint venture or associated company operates. We may also be required to carry out joint venture activities in
compliance with applicable competition laws, which may limit the scope of such joint venture activity or
cooperation.

Each of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and/or prospects, and may also adversely affect our relationships with housing associations and Local
Authorities that deal with or are party to our joint ventures, associated companies and special purpose vehicles.

**_Our assets and projects can be impacted by the weather and the effects of climate change._**

Our assets and projects can be impacted by both short-term and longer-term weather events and longerterm changes to weather patterns. At a local level, changes to coastlines, river levels and directions, flood plains
and other geographic features can impact our ability to conduct our operations and impact the value of our assets.
In addition, the markets that we operate in could experience changes in weather patterns or weather intensity
compared to historical norms, which may make the timetable for planning, developing and constructing properties
more unpredictable and result in higher costs. Our exposure to events and changes of this type may be exacerbated
by the fact that we operate solely in the UK.

In addition statutory and regulatory responses to climate change and other environmental issues could
have an impact on our business. These could include changes to building regulation, the use of materials, higher
energy costs, the availability of insurance, carbon offsets, the location and structure of developments, closer
monitoring of resource depletion and air and water quality, as well as the allocation of public expenditure. Such
weather and climate change risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and/or prospects.

**_We are dependent on the strength of our brands, trademarks and other intellectual property rights._**

Our brands, trademarks and other intellectual property (“IP”), particularly the “Keepmoat Homes” brand,
logo and trademark, are part of our business and success. Although we believe that our IP is adequately supported


-----

by applications for registrations, existing registrations and other legal protections in the UK, these protections
may be challenged by others. A successful challenge to these protections, or any other damage to our IP (including,
for example, the loss of a brand’s strength), could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and/or prospects.

**_We may be required to make up shortfalls to unfunded contractual promises which sit outside of pension_**
**_legislation._**

We provide retirement benefits for our former and current employees through defined contribution
pension schemes. We contribute to the Keepmoat Limited Group Pension Plan (“KPP”), which is an occupational
defined contribution pension scheme in which the assets are held in independently administered funds. Pension
costs (included within operating profit) were £1.8 million for the financial year ended October 31, 2020. We also
maintain a separate contractual agreement (the “Underpin”) for less than 15 members which is an unfunded
contractual promise outside of pension legislation.

To comply with the terms of the Underpin, we may be required to contribute to individual members’
accounts where the market value of the individual members account at retirement is less than the Underpin
promise. This amount payable is dependent on the market value of the individual members’ account at the time
of retirement. The KPP is currently in surplus in the amount of £1.14 million as of April 30, 2021 (representing
the value of the plan’s assets in excess of the combined value of members’ accounts) and held in a contingency
fund which may be used to fund the Underpin.

**Risks Relating to the Transactions**

**_The Acquisition is subject to certain conditions and risks and, if it is not consummated, the Issuer will redeem_**
**_the Notes at 100% of the issue price, plus accrued and unpaid interest._**

On August 4, 2021, Aermont entered into the Acquisition Agreement to acquire, directly or indirectly,
from the Sellers all of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company. The Acquisition is subject to the
satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including, customary antitrust and regulatory approvals and the
performance of certain closing actions. To the extent the Acquisition will not complete on or shortly after the
Issue Date, concurrently with the closing of the Offering, and pending release to consummate of the Acquisition,
the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Account, held in the name
of the Issuer. The release of the Escrowed Property is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including
that the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any event
within three Business Days). As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, we do not yet know whether the
Acquisition will be successful.

If the conditions precedent to the Acquisition are not satisfied or waived, as applicable, by the Escrow
Longstop Date, then the Acquisition will not be consummated. If the conditions to the release of the Escrowed
Property, as more fully described under “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption” have not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain_
other events, the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption as described in “Description of the
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and you may not obtain the return you expect to_
receive on the Notes.

**_If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required_**
**_to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account will not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without_**
**_relying on an additional equity investment from the shareholders_**

The Escrowed Property will be limited initially to the gross proceeds of the Offering and will not be
sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”), which is equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes,_
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption”). If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuer will_
be required to redeem the Notes and, if the Escrow Account alone does not have sufficient funds to cover such
redemption and, as such, the Issuer will be required to obtain the necessary funds elsewhere, such as equity
investment from shareholders.


-----

The Issuer has no revenue generating activities of its own and no independent business operations and
there can be no assurance that the Issuer will have sufficient funds to make this payment, and the Issuer may not
have access to the funds necessary to allow it to pay the full amount of the required redemption price in the event
of a Special Mandatory Redemption.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or financial
position of the Group, or the terms of the Acquisition, between the Issue Date and the Escrow Release Date, may
have an impact on our creditworthiness, and you will not be able to rescind your decision to invest in the Notes
as a result thereof.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure**

**_Normalized EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution when making an_**
**_investment decision._**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present Normalized EBITDA, which is derived using various
assumptions related to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our EBITDA. See “Summary Historical
_Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial Information” for additional details_
regarding these adjustments to our Normalized EBITDA and their underlying assumptions. We believe that
Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 is a measure that assists in understanding our
performance during a period impacted by the market disruption caused by COVID-19 by substituting the October
2020 Management Adjusted EBITDA for the October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA, comprising the
months of our last calendar equivalent financial quarter prior to the market disruption caused by COVID-19. Our
operations during the three months ended October 31, 2020 were negatively impacted following the government
imposed lockdown and the subsequent delayed ramp up on home construction and sales, before resuming
normalized operations during the three month period ended January 31, 2021. As a result, we believe Normalized
EBITDA to be more representative of our Adjusted EBITDA performance for the twelve months ended July 31,
2021 and takes into account, on a highly illustrative basis, the cyclicality of our business.

The assumptions we have made with respect to the Normalized EBITDA that we present in this Offering
Memorandum are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may
cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results,
performance or achievements implied by such adjusted financial information.

Specifically, to derive the Normalized EBITDA, we have replaced the last fiscal quarter of our October
31, 2020 financial year spanning a period where construction activity in the United Kingdom was still slowed due
to confinement measures.

In addition, Normalized EBITDA does not (i) give effect to any other event, favorable or unfavorable,
that happened or could have happened during the three months ended October 31, 2020, other than the events
directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic or (ii) adjust for the positive or negative effect of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic during the nine months ended July 31, 2021.

As a result, we cannot assure you that the difference between the October 2020 Management Adjusted
EBITDA and the October 2019 Management Adjusted EBITDA may not be partly due to factors other than the
COVID-19 pandemic, such as overall market trends and conditions or competitive pressures we are facing, and
there is no guarantee that any such difference is recoverable or will be recovered by our business in future periods.

You should exercise caution when evaluating the adjustments reflected in the Normalized EBITDA and
whether you consider these to be appropriate, as this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.
Normalized EBITDA is derived from management accounts and not from accounts or financial statements that
are complaint with IFRS, and is materially different from Adjusted EBITDA as a result of various adjustments.
Normalized EBITDA is not derived from accounts that have been audited or independently reviewed by our
auditors. It should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our
performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.

While we use Normalized EBITDA to assess our operating performance, and we believe that similar
measures are commonly used by investors, we cannot guarantee that Normalized EBITDA, as presented in this
Offering Memorandum, is comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, due to, among
other things, differences in the way such measures are calculated.


-----

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

We are, and following the issuance of the Notes, will continue to be, highly leveraged. We cannot
guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations on
an ongoing basis. As of July 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had £285.2 million
of total third-party borrowings (including lease liabilities under IFRS 16), comprising the Notes (excluding capital
debt issuance costs) and development loans. See “Capitalization.” In addition, we have £70 million of further
available borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility which we may draw in the future.

The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

      - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

      - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

      - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment
of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash
flow, and limiting the ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital
expenditure, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes;

      - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the
competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;

      - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they
are not as highly leveraged; and

      - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, including the Notes.

We have historically, and may in the future, experience significant fluctuations in our monthly and intramonth working capital. As a result, we may rely on our Revolving Credit Facility to fund a portion of our working
capital requirements following the Issue Date. Drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility will vary and may
be substantially higher during certain months and weeks to compensate for months with reduced cash reserves.

Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture, which
could further exacerbate the risks described above. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that with respect to a
distressed disposal of, or an enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, holders of the Notes will
receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain
other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture to be secured in priority to the Notes have been repaid in
full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” Additionally, we could
raise additional debt that could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture and the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these
restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances,
the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In
addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations
that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations
and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. The Indenture and the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

      - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

      - create or incur certain liens;

      - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of
the Issuer;


-----

      - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

      - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

      - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries;

      - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

      - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

      - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

      - consolidate or merge with other entities; and

      - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

All these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future_
operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our
interest.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will require us to comply with a financial test under
certain circumstances. Our ability to meet that financial test can be affected by events beyond our control, and we
cannot assure you that we will meet it. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the
relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In
addition, any default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could lead to an event of default and
acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the
Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of
those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay
those amounts in full, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to
make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those
amounts, our creditors could enforce against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_Despite our current indebtedness and restrictive covenants, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur_**
**_significant additional amounts of debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the_**
**_risks associated with our substantial leverage._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture and
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be
substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent us from
incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as such term is defined under those agreements.
Moreover, although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on our
ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends, we will be able to make
substantial restricted payments under certain circumstances. Adding new debt to our and our subsidiaries’ existing
debt levels or making restricted payments could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage
described above, including our possible inability to service our debt.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not_**
**_be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the
Revolving Credit Facility and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend
on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the success of our
business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other
factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control.


-----

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated revenue growth, cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and
equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including
the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including the repayment at maturity of any then outstanding amount
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will mature six months prior to the maturity of the Notes.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

The commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility can be further increased, assuming we have the
ability to incur such additional debt under the restrictive covenants included in the Indenture. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of the Notes or any other debt_
that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our
debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our
indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we
may be forced to:

      - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure;

      - sell assets;

      - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

      - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital-raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot
assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms,
if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our
credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt,
including the Notes, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may limit, and any future debt
may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest
rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business,
financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets that we could be required
to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such
sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet
our obligations.

**_Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will bear interest at floating rates that could rise_**
**_significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum
rates equal to EURIBOR for loans denominated in euro, or for loans denominated in sterling, a compounded
reference rate based on the Sterling Overnight Index Average compounded in arrear (“SONIA”) (as the case may
be), as adjusted periodically, plus a margin. Fluctuations in EURIBOR or SONIA may increase our overall interest
burden and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to service our debt obligations. Although we may
enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that
hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. To the extent that interest
rates or any drawings were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase,
reducing our cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a
number of national governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks
that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR or EURIBOR may have been manipulating
or attempting to manipulate LIBOR or EURIBOR. Actions by EURIBOR-EBF (the association that sets the
regulatory framework for the calculation of EURIBOR), other regulators or law enforcement agencies could result
in changes to the manner in which LIBOR or EURIBOR is determined. In addition, SONIA, EURIBOR, LIBOR
and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are or may be


-----

the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO
Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as
benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds,
which were entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner
of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past,
or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For
example, on July 27, 2017, and in subsequent speeches (including the speech by its chief executive on July 12,
2018) the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit
rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021.

The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of
administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to
the manner in which EURIBOR, LIBOR or SONIA is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms
and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but
not limited to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or
the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported LIBOR or EURIBOR, which could
have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt on drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
or any future indebtedness that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Revolving_**
**_Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture_**
**_are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes._**
**_Holders of the Notes will not control decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured initially on a first-priority basis by the same
Collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, under the terms
of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may
be secured by the same Collateral on a _pari passu_ basis with the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive
proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to the Notes. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will
permit currency and interest rate hedging and certain other indebtedness incurred in accordance with the Indenture
to be secured on a priority basis.

In the event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement,
creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the
Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the
Indenture will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority
to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the Notes may not be able to
recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under Super Senior Liabilities (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the
Collateral will, after all obligations under Super Senior Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) have
been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations
secured by the Collateral that are permitted to rank _pari passu and are secured on a_ _pari passu basis with the_
Notes. As a result, proceeds from the sale of Collateral in connection with any enforcement action may be
insufficient to pay claims under the Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets
that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the
Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security
Agent for the secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor
Agreement. The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the
Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) for the purpose of enforcement. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”_ and “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Creditors under Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders
of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies
under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other
assets of such entities securing such Notes and Notes Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”_ and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”


-----

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral
described in this Offering Memorandum, which Collateral will also secures the obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement. We may increase the amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facilities or incur
additional Super Senior Liabilities permitted under the Indenture, as a result of which the amount that will benefit
from “super priority” first-priority security interests in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted
under the Indenture. The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent
permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to
the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral.

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral.
There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations
under the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes
may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes.

The value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions. The fair market value of the Collateral at any
point in time may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic
conditions, industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such
Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly
sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not
our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and
condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as
a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. As a
result, the book value of the Collateral should not be conclusively relied on as a measure of realizable value for
such assets following the occurrence of an event of default or enforcement event under the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. All or a portion of the Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a
market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our
liquidation. In addition, the security granted over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject
to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned
by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property
subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and
the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that
Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would
have only an unsecured claim (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) against the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the
intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of
the Collateral.

In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to
us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the charged shares or other Collateral or, if such
market does exist, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of this
Collateral may fluctuate over time.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other
creditors that have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral from time to time. The existence of any such
exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral
securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.
Furthermore, the first priority ranking of security interests with respect to the Notes can be affected by a variety
of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws
of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share charges, whether


-----

by means of a public auction or a competitive sales process, may be subject to certain specific requirements and
the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure
you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents
of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security
Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease. See “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for further information._

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of_**
**_permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may create hardening
periods for such security interests. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted
to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture
will permit the release and retaking of security granted in respect of the Notes in certain circumstances, including
in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security
interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated.

Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of
the respective hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.
If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding-up proceeding after the
Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in the Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater
risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being voided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver,
liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency
law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of
the security interest.

The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection
with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their
relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes. See “Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor, as applicable, of the security.
The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we
fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights
in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a
security interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security
interest if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider
until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security
provider in favor of the security taker over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally,
since the ranking of charges is sometimes determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third
parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third
parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) may have priority. Neither the
Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility to monitor the acquisition of additional
property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or actions to perfect or ensure the
perfection of, any security interest in the Notes against third parties. See “Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for_
further information.

**_The Escrow Charges will be granted to the Trustee and the security interests in the remaining Collateral will_**
**_be granted to the Security Agent, in each case, rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of_**
**_the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and
the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the


-----

relevant Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent, which will also hold interests in the
Collateral for the benefit of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of the Notes and the
holders of any additional debt secured by Collateral permitted to be incurred under the Indenture. The Indenture
will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the
Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not
be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee,
who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral. See “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor_
_Agreement.”_

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of_**
**_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing
the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the
Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary
course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of
the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of Notes under which the Collateral securing_**
**_the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will_**
**_be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be released
automatically. See “Description of the Notes—The Notes Guarantees” and “Description of the Notes—Security—
_Release of Liens.” In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of our_
subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, then claims under
the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be released or transferred. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” Your_
ability to recover on the Notes could be materially impaired in such circumstances.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and
retaken in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes, if the Issuer has confirmed
in writing to the Security Agent that it has determined that it is neither possible nor desirable to implement any
such refinancing on terms satisfactory to it by instead granting additional Collateral and/or amending the terms of
the existing Collateral. Such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening
period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or
representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such Collateral. Any such
challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of such Collateral and thus reduce your
recovery under the Notes.

**_The Issuer is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary that, following the completion of the Offering, will have no_**
**_revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on cash flows from operating companies to make_**
**_payments on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company with no revenue-generating activities of its
own and does not have any business operations, material assets or liabilities (other than those incurred in
connection with its incorporation and, following the completion of the Transactions and the application of the
proceeds therefrom, its rights under the Proceeds Loan). Repayment of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including under
the Notes, is dependent on the profitability and cash flow of the subsidiaries of the Company and their ability to
make such cash available to the Issuer, by dividend distributions, or otherwise. The subsidiaries of the Company
may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness, or by law, in their
ability to make distributions or advance upstream loans to enable us to make payments in respect of our
indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of the subsidiaries of the Company is a distinct legal entity and, under
certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from the subsidiaries
of the Company. Furthermore, goodwill impairment and other non-cash charges in our profit or loss account, as
well as charges recognized directly in equity, if incurred, could reduce the Company’s subsidiaries’ reserves
available for distribution and thus reduce or prevent upstream dividend payments to the Issuer.


-----

While the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will limit the ability of the Group’s
subsidiaries to incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments
to us, such limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not
receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and
interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. We do not expect to have any other sources of funds
that would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor members of our group._**

Some, but not all, of the members of the Group will guarantee the Notes. As of, and for the twelve months
ended, July 31, 2021, the Guarantors accounted for 99% of total assets, 100% of revenue and 99% of Adjusted
EBITDA of the KM Group. In addition, as of July 31, 2021, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes did
not have any outstanding third-party financial indebtedness. Unless a member of our group is a Guarantor, such
member will have no obligation to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose.
The Indenture will, subject to some limitations, permit our non-Guarantor restricted subsidiaries to incur
substantial amounts of additional indebtedness and will not restrict the amount of other liabilities that may be
incurred by these subsidiaries. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor
companies, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the
assets of such non-guarantor companies before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any
Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor company becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized
or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

      - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such company; and

      - the creditors of such non-guarantor company, including trade creditors, will generally be
entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before
any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions
from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Notes Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including
trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

**_Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited_**
**_by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Notes Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant
Guarantor. However, the Indenture will provide that each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee, as it relates to
that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Notes
Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See “Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The_
same limitations may apply to security interests (other than the Notes Guarantees) that will be provided by the
Guarantors in certain jurisdictions.

Enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees or security against any Guarantor will be subject to certain
defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses generally include those that
relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or
bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, the preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of
these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Notes
Guarantee or other security depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on
the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability
of any Notes Guarantee against any Guarantor.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and
other laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes
Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant


-----

Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to
you, typically if the court found that:

      - the relevant Notes Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor
over another, to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor; or, in certain
jurisdictions, when the granting of the Notes Guarantees has the effect of giving a creditor a
preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted
the relevant Notes Guarantee;

      - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate
benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee and the Guarantor: (i) was insolvent or rendered
insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; (ii) was undercapitalized or became
undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed
that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

      - the relevant Notes Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not
to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

      - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant
to the Indenture or other securities pursuant to the Security Documents.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was
“insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that
a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a
Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes
constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee or other security will be limited to the amount
that will result in such Notes Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper
corporate distribution, or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a
court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. It is possible that the
entire Notes Guarantee or other security may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court decided that a Notes Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided
such Notes Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect
of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor
under the relevant Notes Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Notes Guarantee is
invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Notes Guarantee
obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if
we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Notes Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent
transfer or conveyance, or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts
outstanding under the Notes.

The payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to
satisfy the obligations under the Notes Guarantees and Security Documents. We are under no obligation to
maintain a specific level of distributable profits and reserves, and, if we have distributable profits and reserves,
we may make dividend payments or payments of principal and interest on the intercompany loan that reduce our
distributable profits and reserves to zero. We may make dividends and enter into intercompany loans to service
indebtedness and for tax planning purposes. There can be no assurance that we will have distributable profits and
reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not
we distribute dividends or enter into intercompany loans. The payment of dividends to service our debt obligations
(including under the Notes) will deplete the distributable reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the
Notes Guarantees. In addition, the payment under the Notes Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests
under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including,
but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions. See “Limitations on
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations” for further information._

**_Upon an IPO Debt Pushdown, material Collateral and Note Guarantees may be released and materially reduce_**
**_the value of the Collateral and/or guarantee package, any retaken Collateral may be subject to hardening_**
**_periods, and holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake the transactions described in “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions Following an IPO” (such transactions, an “IPO_
**Debt Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuers are entitled to give notice that will automatically operate so that,**
among other things, the references in the Indenture and any Intercreditor Agreement to such Issuer and Restricted
Subsidiaries shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement— Provisions Following an IPO”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as_
defined in “Description of the Notes”). In such event, each holding or parent company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
would be released from its obligations under the applicable Debt Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement), which would include the release of Note Guarantees and Collateral provided by such entities. There
are no restrictions on the transfer of assets to such entities prior to an IPO Debt Pushdown, and any such release
may materially reduce the Collateral and/or guarantor coverage securing the Notes. Moreover, we may elect to,
but are not under any obligation to, revoke or otherwise reverse an IPO Debt Pushdown undertaken in anticipation
of an initial public offering, or to replace any Note Guarantees or Collateral released pursuant thereto, in the event
such initial public offering is not consummated. To the extent that new security documents in respect of any
Collateral to be retaken (including a charge over the shares of the Issuer) are entered into, such Collateral may be
subject to new hardening periods. In addition, such modifications to the terms of the Notes, including any change
in the primary obligor or guarantors of the Notes in connection with an IPO Debt Pushdown, could be treated for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications
for (ii) new Notes as in place after such modifications. If such modifications result in a deemed exchange for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, such deemed exchange generally would be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes may be required to recognize gain or, subject
to possible application of the “wash sale” rules, loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the new
Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount. In such
event, holders subject to U.S. federal income taxation would be required to include the original issue discount in
their income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), in advance of the receipt of
cash corresponding to such income. Holders subject to U.S. federal income taxation should consult their own tax
advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to potential modifications of the Notes in
connection with an IPO Debt Pushdown. It is also possible that an IPO Debt Pushdown could result in a taxable
event for tax purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control and the_**
**_occurrence of certain important corporate events will not constitute a Change of Control._**

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “Change of Control” (as
defined in the Indenture). Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer to repurchase
all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you
that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to
the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would
allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may trigger a mandatory prepayment of the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an
offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of
the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the
occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. If we repay a portion
of the Notes in an amount over 50% of the principal amount of the Notes in aggregate, we will be required under
the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to reduce the commitments under the Revolving Credit
Facility proportionately in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Sufficient funds
may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of
Control were to occur at a time when our group is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose
of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the
Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such
borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer would remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we
expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of
Control. We cannot assure you that our Group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer
to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a
default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”


-----

The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar
transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in
voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control as defined in
the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not
contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control will be
deemed not to be a Change of Control if a certain net consolidated leverage ratio calculated in accordance with
the “Description of the Notes” is not exceeded in connection with such an event. In this case holders of Notes
would not be entitled to require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes and would only be able to rely on the then
prevailing trading prices in order to exit their investments, which might be lower than the 101% change of control
repurchase price. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Definitions—Change of Control Triggering Event.”_

The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to any person. Although there
is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change
of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant Notes.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of relevant Notes unless and
until definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its
nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will
be made to the Principal Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such
payments will be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in
the Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to Euroclear and
Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, Transfer Agent, Principal Paying Agent or the
Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments of interest,
principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you
own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you
are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own
your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or
requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including the enforcement of security for the Notes
and the Notes Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common depositary
(or its nominee) (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and/or will be permitted to act
directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if
applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies
will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant
Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you
will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the
Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

      - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

      - your ability to sell your Notes; or

      - the price at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices
of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a
general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices.
The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes
may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have
a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a
result, there can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading
market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the
Notes on the Exchange we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although no assurance can
be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to the Exchange, failure to be approved for
listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the
Notes from the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary
market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional Notes in the future, which could adversely
impact the liquidity of the relevant Notes.

**_United States civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us._**

The Issuer and all of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and all of
our assets are located outside the United States. In addition, all members of our board and our officers reside
outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United
States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States
judgments obtained against such persons in United States courts in any action. In addition, it may be difficult for
investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights
predicated upon United States laws. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

The United States and England currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. This may give
rise to difficulties in respect of the enforcement in England and Wales of judgments obtained in the United States.
See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the
likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact
of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect
the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject
to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit
rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension,
reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more of the credit
rating agencies may adversely affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings, and could adversely affect
the value and trading of the Notes.


-----

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act
or the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in
the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. The
Notes are not being offered for sale in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A. We have
not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes with the US Securities and Exchange Commission
(including by way of an exchange offer). See “Notice to Investors.” It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to
ensure that their offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable
securities laws.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in pound sterling. If investors measure their investment
returns by reference to a currency other than the pound sterling, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign
exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the pound sterling
relative to the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments. These
changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the
pound sterling against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments
could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss
to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors
measure the return on their investments.

**_Investors in the Notes may have limited recourse against the independent auditors._**

In respect of the auditors’ reports relating to the consolidated financial statements of the Group
reproduced herein, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Group’s independent auditors, states the following: “This
report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.”

Investors in the Notes should understand that, in making these statements, the independent auditors
confirmed that they do not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as the purchasers of the Notes) other
than the Group with respect to the report and to the independent auditors’ audit work and opinion. The SEC would
not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection
with an offering of securities registered under the US Securities Act, or in a report filed under the US Exchange
Act. If a US court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language quoted above, the recourse that investors
in the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their report or the combined and consolidated
financial information to which they relate could be limited.

**_Our majority shareholder may have interests that do not align with yours._**

Following the Acquisition, the Company will be indirectly owned by funds and co-investment vehicles
managed by Aermont together with certain management shareholders. Aermont is an independent asset
management group focused on real estate and real estate related investment activities. Aermont has the power to
control our affairs and policies and also controls, to a large degree, the election of directors, the appointment of
management and the entry into mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary transactions.
The directors so elected will have authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness (including the Notes), to
issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions. The
interests of our majority shareholder could conflict with your interests. For example, if we encounter financial
difficulties or are unable to pay our indebtedness as it matures, the interests of our majority shareholder and certain
of its affiliates as equity holders might conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes. Aermont may also
have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in its judgment, could
enhance its equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of the Notes.
Additionally, Aermont is in the business of making investments in companies, and may from time to time acquire
interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or
customers of ours. For more information, see “Our Shareholder” and “Related Party Transactions.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The Offering is expected to be consummated prior to the completion of the Acquisition. To the extent
the Acquisition will not complete on or shortly after the Issue Date, pending consummation of the Acquisition, on
the Issue Date, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Account. The
release of the Escrow Proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the closing of
the Acquisition.

The aggregate gross proceeds from the Offering will be £275 million. The Issuer intends to use the gross
proceeds from the Offering, together with the Equity Contribution, to: (i) fund the consideration payable for the
Acquisition, (ii) repay Existing Target Indebtedness, (iii) repay Sellers transaction costs, and (iv) pay the fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses with respect to the Transactions. Actual
amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the date of consummation of
the Acquisition, the cash consideration to be paid pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement on the Completion Date,
the outstanding balances due under the Existing Target Indebtedness as of the Completion Date, the amount of
the Equity Contribution and the difference between estimated and actual fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Transactions.

In particular, the purchase price under the Acquisition Agreement as shown below reflects the agreed
base consideration as adjusted for our estimates of an agreed ticker fee accruing until the Completion Date and
certain notified cash leakage items, certain payments arising as a result of the Transactions and certain other
adjustments required under the Acquisition Agreement. This amount is expected to change depending on number
of factors, including, among others, the timing of the Completion Date.

**Sources of funds** **Amount Uses of funds** **Amount**

**(£in millions)** **(£ in millions)**
Notes offered hereby[(1)] ......................... 275.0 Acquisition Consideration[(3)] ..................... 517.1

Transaction fees and expenses[(7)] ............... 24.1

**Total Sources ......................................** **751.1 Total Uses .............................................** **751.1**

(1) Represents the gross proceeds of the Notes offered hereby.

(2) Represents the estimated amount of funds to be invested by funds and co-investment vehicles managed by Aermont together with certain

management shareholders, which will be contributed in a combination of the Company PIK Loan and preference shares to the Company
on or about the Completion Date. The final contribution amount will be based on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities,
Existing Target Indebtedness and purchase price adjustments as of the Completion Date. See “The Transactions.”

(3) Represents the estimated total cash consideration payable to the Sellers for the purchase of 100% of the share capital of the Target.

Represents the agreed base consideration payable to the Sellers pursuant to the Acquisition as adjusted for our estimates of an agreed
ticker fee accruing until the Completion Date and certain notified cash leakage items, certain payments arising as a result of the
Transactions and certain other adjustments required under the Acquisition Agreement. The purchase price under the Acquisition
Agreement is calculated as the agreed base consideration plus the agreed ticker fee from April 30, 2021 until the Completion Date
(assuming a Completion Date of October 27, 2021) minus certain notified leakage and adjustments for various other liabilities transferred
in connection with the sale, certain payments arising as a result of the Transactions and certain other adjustments required under the
Acquisition Agreement. See “Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.”

(4) Represents the estimated amount of the Existing Target Indebtedness, including the principal amount thereof as of July 31, 2021,

excluding accrued and unpaid interest, which we estimate will be approximately £2.9 million assuming a Completion Date of October
27, 2021. The amount presented in the table includes break fees, estimated at £2.4 million. The amount presented in the table above does
not include any further drawings made under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility after July 31, 2021 and the actual amount of Existing
Target Indebtedness may vary depending on the timing of the completion of the Acquisition.

(5) Represents certain transaction costs of the Sellers and net disclosed transaction bonuses, estimated to be £45.4 million (to the extent that

these costs exceed this amount, the amount of consideration for the Acquisition will be reduced to reflect this increased liability).


-----

(6) Represents other debt-like items and adjustments to be repaid as part of the Transactions, including intercompany loans and other similar

items.

(7) Represents estimated fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions, including advisory, due diligence, listing, brokerage and

other professional fees and costs. Actual fees and expenses may vary. To the extent such amounts exceed our estimates, settlement of
transaction fees and expenses will be covered on or after consummation of the Acquisition with cash on hand and/or drawings under the
Revolving Credit Facility.


-----

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the consolidated cash and cash equivalents and consolidated capitalization
as of July 31, 2021 of (i) KM Group on an actual consolidated basis, and (ii) the Company on an as adjusted basis
to give pro forma effect to the Transactions described in this Offering Memorandum as if the Transactions had
occurred on July 31, 2021. The adjustments are based on available information and contain assumptions.

The Company is a holding company formed in connection with the Acquisition and does not have any
business operations, material assets (other than shares and other interests in the Issuer and, upon completion of
the Acquisition, the Target) or material liabilities other than incurred in connection with the Transactions.
Capitalization amounts as of July 31, 2021 presented below have not been audited or reviewed by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

The historical information in the KM Group “Actual” column has been derived from the unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements of KM Group included elsewhere herein. You should read the following
table in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Selected
_Historical Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results_
_of Operations,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements,” “Description of the Notes” and our_
consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein.

(1) The “As Adjusted” column does not reflect (among other things) trading movements subsequent to July 31, 2021, including trading
movements in cash and cash equivalents after such date and payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Target Indebtedness
to be paid on the Completion Date.

(2) The actual cash and cash equivalents amount is based upon actual cash balance as of July 31, 2021 of £45.2 million less bank overdrafts

of £7.3 million. See “Use of Proceeds.”

(3) Amounts shown are not reduced by the amount of capitalized debt issuance costs.

(4) Represents the estimated amount of the Existing Target Indebtedness, including the principal amount thereof as of July 31, 2021,
excluding accrued and unpaid interest, which we estimate will be approximately £2.9 million assuming a Completion Date of October
27, 2021. The amount presented in the table includes break fees, estimated at £2.4 million. The amount presented in the table above does
not include any further drawings made under the Existing Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility after July 31, 2021 and the actual
amount of Existing Target Indebtedness may vary depending on the timing of the completion of the Acquisition.

(5) Represents the aggregate principal amount of Notes offered hereby.

(6) We currently expect no amounts to be drawn in cash under the Revolving Credit Facility as of the Completion Date.

(7) Represents the principal amount of other existing indebtedness including development loans. Amount shown does not include any land
creditor commitments. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and
_Capital Resources—Commitments and Contingent Liabilities—Land Creditor Commitments” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Development Loans.”_

(8) The KM Group Actual column represents the sum of the historical share capital and share premium as per the Unaudited Condensed

Consolidated Financial Statements of KM Group as of July 31, 2021. The Company As Adjusted column represents the KM Group’s
shareholders’ equity as included in the KM Group Actual column as adjusted for the Transactions, including amounts funded under the
Company PIK Loan as part of the Equity Contribution. We do not present a historical consolidated shareholders’ equity amount for the
Company because the Company has been formed to facilitate the Transactions and, as such, does not currently prepare consolidated
financial statements. The Total equity amount shown for the Company in the “As Adjusted” column will likely change significantly as
a result of our preparation of consolidated financial statements for the Company and our application of acquisition accounting for the
Acquisition.

**SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The tables below set forth the selected historical consolidated financial information and other data of the
KM Group as of and for the dates and for the periods indicated. The Issuer was formed on September 7, 2021, for
the purpose of issuing the Notes offered hereby. The Company was incorporated on July 23, 2021 for the purposes
of facilitating the Transactions. The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Company has no material assets or liabilities, does not
have any revenue generating activities of its own, and has not engaged in actions other than those related to its
incorporation and in preparation of the Transactions. As a result, no historical information of the Company is
included in this Offering Memorandum.

The Issuer conducts no business operations of its own and, as of the Issue Date, will have no material
assets and its only material liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness (including its obligations under the
Notes) and, as of the Completion Date, its only material assets will be its rights and claims under the Proceeds
Loan. The Issuer has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its formation and the issuance of the
Notes.

The Target has not prepared consolidated financial information and operates its business through
Keystone Midco Limited and its subsidiaries. Furthermore, neither the Issuer nor the Company has any material
assets or liabilities and neither has engaged in any activities other than those related to their formation in
preparation for the Offering and the Transactions. Because of the limited historical financial information available
for the Issuer, the Company and the Target, unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this
Offering Memorandum is the historical consolidated financial information of the KM Group, which is generally
representative of the financial information of the Group. See “Presentation of Historical and Other Information—
_Differences Between the Financial Statements of the Target and the KM Group.”_

In 2018, the KM Group changed its financial year end from March 31 to October 31. As a result, the KM
Group’s financial year ended on October 31 for the financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020, and on
March 31 for the financial year ended March 31, 2018. In addition, in connection with the change in financial
year, the KM Group presented audited financial statements as of and for the seven months ended October 31,
2018.

The selected consolidated income statement, balance sheet and cash flow information for the KM Group
set forth below (i) as of and for the financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020 were derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020; (ii) as of and
for the seven months ended October 31, 2018 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as
of and for the seven months ended October 31, 2018; (iii) as of and for the financial year ended March 31, 2018
was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements for the seven months ended October 31, 2018; (iv)
as of and for the nine months ended July 31, 2021 was derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements as of and for the nine months ended July 31, 2021; and (v) as of and for nine months ended
July 31, 2020 was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.

The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for the financial year ended March
31, 2018 has been derived from the restated comparative information contained in the audited financial statements
for the year ended October 31, 2018 as restated to give effect to IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with
_Customers). See note 26 to the financial statements for the seven months ended October 31, 2018 and_
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers).”

In addition, information below includes certain unaudited condensed consolidated financial information
for the KM Group as of and for the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2021. The historical consolidated financial
information of the KM Group for the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2021 is unaudited and has been
calculated by adding the unaudited results of operations of the KM Group for the nine months ended July 31, 2021
to the audited results of operations of the KM Group for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 and then
subtracting the unaudited results of operations of the KM Group for the nine months ended July 31, 2020. The
unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 has been prepared solely for the
purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our
results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

The selected historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum was prepared in
accordance with IFRS. The information below is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any


-----

future periods. The financial data below also includes certain Non-IFRS Measures that are not required by, or
presented in accordance with, IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction. The Non-IFRS Measures
are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction
and should not be considered substitutes to other indicators of the KM Group’s operating performance, cash flows,
or any other measure derived in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”

The financial information presented for the interim periods or prior years is not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. The financial
information presented herein has been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical
financial information and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and the sections
entitled “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,”” and

_From April 1, 2018, the KM Group prepared its audited consolidated financial statements based on an_
_October 31 fiscal year end. Previously, the KM Group audited consolidated financial statements were prepared_
_based upon a March 31 fiscal year end. As such, the KM Group prepared audited consolidated financial_
_statements for the fiscal year end March 31, 2018 and the seven months ended October 31, 2018, each of which_
_are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. However, a discussion of these results are not included in_
_this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” given that they_
_are not directly comparable to the audited consolidated financial statements of the KM Group for the financial_
_years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020._

_Except as the context otherwise indicates, when discussing historical results of operations in this_

**Overview**

We are one of the UK’s oldest and most experienced partnership housebuilders, with “5-Star
Homebuilder” status awarded in 2021. We are focused on creating sustainable communities in places where
people want to live, and we specialize in the delivery of affordable and high quality homes, principally targeted
at first-time buyers. Headquartered in Doncaster, England, we operate across England and Scotland through nine
operating regions. We are a top ten UK housebuilder, measured by the number of homes sold, including delivering
4,035 homes in our financial year ended October 31, 2019.

Unlike traditional housebuilders, our business model is based on partnerships with entities interested in
seeing an increase in supply of homes as well as those with demand for our product. These partners are primarily
land owners (such as Homes England, Local Authorities and private land owners) or Registered Providers, which
include the traditional not-for-profit and the newer for-profit entities that are registered with the Regulator of
Social Housing to provide affordable housing. We engage each of our key stakeholders in residential projects by
establishing, aligning and prioritizing their needs and successfully delivering their objectives. We have built our
reputation by aligning our approach to our partners’ objectives regarding the sourcing, procurement, planning and
delivery of successful, affordable housing developments that create significant social value. We believe that we
are the original partnership-focused housebuilder in the United Kingdom, having worked with over 200 partners
to date, with many of these relationships enduring for over 20 years.

Our partnership model allows us to have a high degree of certainty over our land pipeline, with sufficient
land secured for six years of development based on our future development plans and on 2019 home deliveries,
while also typically allowing us to defer payment until milestones are met. We are also able to minimize
development and planning risks by partnering with land owners through the early stages of a development project.
Coupled with the relatively low land costs for the affordable homes that we target, we are able to operate a capitallight business model relative to traditional housebuilders, and generate relatively strong cash conversion and
ROCE. In the financial year ended October 31, 2019, the last full financial year prior to the start of the COVID19 pandemic, our ROCE was 32.8%.


-----

We focus on developing urban and suburban locations where there is an inherent demand and supply
imbalance for new homes. We aim to meet this demand through our five core standard house type ranges. This
standardization allows efficiency in procuring materials and construction, increased certainty of cost and timing
of delivery, and assists in establishing optimal site layout mix based on demand and our partners’ preferences. We
are continually working with new technologies that underpin and refine our designs.

We are committed to deliver a range of affordable housing, predominantly for open market sale, social
housing and shared ownership – which provides us with a higher degree of market resilience over the long term
due to generally consistent demand from first-time buyers and well-funded Registered Providers. In the financial
year ended October 31, 2020, approximately 74% of our sales were on the open market (which includes sales to
private customers as well as elective sales to Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a
site), with the remaining approximately 26% of our sales comprising sales to Registered Providers that are
contracted at the outset of development of a site, including but not limited to those contracted to satisfy Section
106 obligations. Approximately 87% of our open market sales in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 were
to private sale customers, of which approximately 76% were to first-time buyers (first-time buyers accounted for
76% during the financial year ended October 31, 2019). In the financial year ended October 31, 2020,
approximately 45% of our total sales, including 67% of sales to first time buyers, involved the use of the
Government HTB scheme. We believe that first-time buyers provide more resilient structural demand than the
typically discretionary and cyclical home-mover segment.

The following charts show our sales mix (by percentage of total homes delivered) and our private sales
customer mix for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021:

(2) Sales mix of open market and Registered Provider sales based on percentage of total homes delivered for the financial year ended

October 31, 2020. Registered Provider sales comprises all sales to Registered Providers that are contracted at the outset of
development of a site, including but not limited to those contracted to satisfy Section 106 obligations. Open market sales include
private sales, elective sales to Registered Providers agreed during the development of a site, Affordable Homes Programme sales
and private rental sector sales. See “—Description of Statement of Comprehensive Income—Revenue.”

(3) Private sales customer mix based on statistics from a survey of 1,053 private sales customers in the financial year ended October

31, 2020.

Sustainability is also a key driver of our operations, with a particular focus on community-building and
place making. In July 2020, following stakeholder consultation, we published our Sustainability Strategy in which
we identified our material issues and aligned our strategy to eight United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
SDGs. Through our Sustainability Strategy, we have committed to minimizing our impact on the environment
and biodiversity. In particular, we have announced that we intend to achieve a net zero carbon position by the
mid-2040s (having formally committed to Race to Zero) and that we intend to publicly disclose our carbon
performance from 2022 onwards.

We were active on 94 sites as of July 31, 2021. In addition, as of July 31, 2021, the number of plots
within our land pipeline was 24,654, with approximately 81% of our land pipeline, or 19,933 plots, being legally
secured (meaning that we have a contractual right to develop or a conditionally exchanged contract). As of July
31, 2021, approximately 19% of our land pipeline, or 4,721 plots, were those on which we had been appointed


-----

preferred developer (meaning that we had been chosen by the land vendor as the final candidate to progress to
contract for the development of the site). Together, these plots are equivalent to a six-year supply of homes, based
on our pre-pandemic annual completion levels.

As of July 31, 2021, we had a forward order book of approximately £503 million (representing 3,151
plots) with an open market sales rate of 0.77 for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021. As of September 19,
2021, we had reserved, exchanged or legally completed almost all of our planned sales for the financial year
ending October 31, 2021. Furthermore, as of September 19, 2021, we had secured approximately 40% of our
planned sales for the year ended October 31, 2022, 85% of our planned sales for the three months ended January
31, 2022, and 45% of our planned sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022. As of September 19, 2021, we
had an eight-week rolling average rate of 0.93, demonstrating continued strong demand from our customers.

Our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 were £628.5 million and
£73.8 million, respectively. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data.” Over the same
period, we generated Free Cash Flow of £44.1 million (and free cash flow conversion of 59.8%). The resilience
of our business model was demonstrated through the COVID-19 pandemic. Working with our partners, we were
able to agree a deferral of 89% of committed and uncommitted land spend, without losing any site investment
opportunities as a result. We believe our financial results in recent quarters demonstrate the resiliency and strength
of our business model.

Our focus on partnerships provides us with an attractive financial model, benefitting from typically lower
land values, attractive (and often deferred) payment terms, the potential for additional elective deals with
Registered Providers (beyond sales in connection with Section 106 affordable housing obligations) and access to
grant funding to optimize returns. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data.”

**Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

Our results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by many factors, some of which
are beyond our control. This section sets out certain key factors that we believe have affected our results of
operations in the period under review or could affect its results of operations in the future.

**_Strength of the UK Housing Market and General Macro-economic Conditions in the UK_**

As we operate and generate our revenue exclusively in the UK, our results are dependent on conditions
in the UK housing market and general macro-economic conditions in the UK — in particular, the demand for
housing and the average selling prices of houses in the regions where we operate. Demand for housing is driven
by a combination of factors, such as the rate of economic growth (both nationally and regionally), the rate of
population growth, the average age and life expectancy of the population, the rate of household formation, the
availability and affordability of mortgages, consumer confidence, the unemployment rate and governmental tax
and incentive schemes (such as the stamp duty rates, holidays and the HTB scheme). Historically, the strength of
the UK housing market and of the housebuilding sector has been linked to that of the UK economy as a whole,
which in turn is influenced by both European and global macro-economic conditions, all of which have been
cyclical in the past. Periods of economic downturn in the UK have generally been correlated with decreases in
demand for homes and in house prices, while favorable economic conditions have generally been correlated with
higher demand and increases in house prices. Since 2013, the UK housing market has benefitted from an improved
economic backdrop, as well as from increased Government support (including from the HTB scheme that started
in 2013). This has contributed to a rise in housebuilding completions to 178,310 in the year ended December 31,
2019, the highest level since 2007.

Nevertheless, the housing market is subject to its own independent dynamics and demand for housing
may sometimes not correlate directly with the broader macro-economic climate. For example, although the
COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on UK housebuilders (including Keepmoat) during 2020 as a result
of curtailed construction during the first national lockdown — with the MHCLG estimating that completions and
starts of new homes in England fell 17% and 16%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020 — in
general the UK housing market has seen robust demand during the pandemic, notwithstanding macro-economic
uncertainty. Nationwide and Halifax reported house price increases of 7.3% and 6.0%, respectively, in the year
ended December 31, 2020 — the strongest annual growth since 2016. Mortgage lending has also been resurgent
with an average of 95,806 monthly mortgage approvals for house purchases in the seven months ended February
28, 2021, the strongest level since 2007. More recent indicators suggest this momentum has continued, with the
number of UK residential purchases in March 2021 being 102.3% higher than March 2020 and 32.2% higher than


-----

February 2021. This momentum has been supported by the tapered extension to September 30, 2021 of the stamp
duty holiday first announced in July 2020.

While macroeconomic factors broadly affect the UK residential property market as a whole, property
trends in the UK historically have varied significantly by region, particularly as between London and the South
East on the one hand and the rest of the UK on the other hand. We operate primarily in lower cost regions (with
all of our nine regions based outside of the greater London area, primarily in the Midlands and the North) where
homes are generally more affordable and where prices tend not to fluctuate as much as in higher cost regions. As
a result, our homes are generally priced at the more affordable end of the market (with an ASP of £174,000 in the
nine months ended July 31, 2021 and £165,000 in the financial year ended October 31, 2020), providing us with
a degree of resilience against macroeconomic downturns. Additionally, in many of these lower cost regions,
mortgages are typically more affordable than rents, which provides additional impetus for first-time buyers to buy
in lieu of renting.

We sell the majority of our homes into the private market, but we are committed to a strategy of delivering
homes of mixed tenure – predominantly for open market sale, affordable rent and shared ownership – helping to
provide a degree of resilience in the longer term through diversification. In the financial year ended October 31,
2020, 74% of our sales were on the open market (which includes sales to private customers as well as elective
sales to Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a site), with the remaining 26% of sales
to Registered Providers for affordable housing pursuant to Section 106 obligations or otherwise agreed with
Registered Providers at the outset of development, where we believe demand is less subject to changing
macroeconomic conditions. Approximately 87% of our open market sales in the financial year ended October 31,
2020 were to private sale customers, of which approximately 76% were to first-time buyers (74% in the financial
year ended October 31, 2019). The ASP of our homes sold through open market sales in the financial year ended
October 31, 2020 was £165,000.

Each of our regions develops and markets its homes according to local conditions and competes with
both new build housing providers who sell houses at a price point similar to us and the secondary housing market.
As a result, local market valuations of both new and secondary homes can impact prices and our revenues. Our
results are also affected to a certain extent by the supply of housing in the second hand-market, as increased stock
in the second-hand market typically leads to lower demand for, and fewer opportunities to construct, new homes.

However, in general, the supply of housing in the UK market has lagged behind demand, and the regions
where we operate in particular are characterized by a supply-demand imbalance. This shortfall has created
favorable trends for housing developers and has encouraged the UK and devolved Scottish governments to take
various stimulus measures, which have been beneficial for us. The Government has announced their target to build
300,000 homes per year by the mid-2020s (as announced in the Autumn Budget 2017), and we expect there to be
continued support for the housebuilding sector as the Government seeks to achieve this target.

**_Our Land Pipeline and Land Creditor Profile_**

Our business and financial returns are highly dependent on acquiring land suitable for new homes on
acceptable commercial terms and developing such projects without significant delay. A significant portion of our
cost of sales relate to the costs of purchasing land. In general, lower land prices help us to sustain a capital light
business model and is one of the components of achieving favorable returns. The costs of securing land in our
consolidated income statement from period to period will be influenced by the terms on which the land is secured
— in particular, whether payment is made up front, in phases or on deferred payment terms. Therefore, our results
of operations are significantly affected by the price of land, and the terms on which it is acquired or secured for
development.

As of July 31, 2021, the number of plots within our land pipeline was 24,654, with approximately 81%
of our land pipeline, or 19,933 plots, being legally secured (meaning that we have a contractual right to develop
or a conditionally exchanged contract). As of July 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our land pipeline, or 4,721
plots, were those on which we had been appointed preferred developer (meaning that we had been chosen by the
land vendor as the final candidate to progress to contract for the development of the site). Together, these plots
are equivalent to a six-year supply of homes, based on our pre-pandemic annual completion levels. Our land
pipeline provides us with a significant degree of visibility with respect to expected home completions and, as a
result, our revenues in the near to medium term.

Our partnership-focused business model differentiates us from most traditional UK housebuilders in the
type of land we focus on and the way we source and deliver the land. We source land through both public and


-----

private sector partners. We believe that by understanding the bid brief and being agile and resourceful in delivering
on land vendors’ requirements, we make ourselves an attractive partner. Land sourced through our partnership
model constituted 79% of our total land pipeline as of July 31, 2021, with the remainder being sourced through
speculative land deals (where we believe we can achieve attractive financial returns).

Our largest source of land is the public sector, typically Homes England and Local Authorities, with
whom we achieve a high proportion of repeat business. These projects are usually brought to market through a
competitive tender process, determined by the FTS (previously OJEU) process, which governs how the public
sector disposes of its land assets and procures development services. In the case of Homes England, this is effected
through DPP3, of which we are a member. As of July 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our secured land pipeline
was secured through the Homes England DPP process. Historically, being a member of DPP3 has reduced the
number of competitors that we compete against to secure large scale public land opportunities, providing us access
to development sites typically unavailable to housebuilders who are not members of DPP3. Homes England
launched its successor to the DPP, the DPDPS, on September 1, 2021, which is designed to modernize the bidding
process through the use of a digital system and encourage new entrants to the market, simplifying the process for
housebuilders to join the list of preferred developers and bid for land. We have submitted our application and
received confirmation that we have been appointed member of the DPDPS. The DPDPS is not expected to be used
to procure schemes until late 2021. With this new system, housebuilders will still have to qualify to be able to join
the list of preferred developers, but they will be able to apply to join at any time, rather than only upon renewal
of the delivery partner panel once every four years, as is currently the case. However, we believe that the depth of
our experience working with Homes England and other public sector partners on large scale development projects
provide us with a distinct competitive advantage. We also source land from the private sector, through
relationships with a small number of national land owners and regionally with land owners and land agents.

Public bodies often focus on disposing of brownfield land, which typically has a lower land value and
can therefore provide a greater potential upside upon development (depending on regeneration costs). This
contributes to our relatively low average land cost (approximately £20,000 per plot (equating to approximately
12.1% of our average ASP of £165,000) in the financial year ended October 31, 2020). Brownfield sites
represented 73% of our legal completions in the financial year ended October 31, 2020.

Our participation in a partnership development may be structured in a number of ways, which are
intended to provide a blend of risk and return appropriate to the land being acquired. Arrangements may involve
that we acquire the land being developed (sometimes in phases) or otherwise we may be granted with development
rights while the original land owner retains ownership of the site and ultimately transfers completed units directly
to the home purchaser. In the case of phased drawdowns, the price is generally finalized at the time the Group is
ready to draw the particular phase of the site down for development. In such arrangements, we have sufficient
time to complete all of our technical due-diligence to be able to appraise the phase based on the prevailing
conditions, utilizing all the experience gained from developing the previous phase. Phased drawdowns provide us
with increased visibility of the end-market and associated cost implications, which thereby reduces our market
risk associated with pre-bought land.

Additionally, where possible, we use deferred payment terms. As of July 31, 2021, approximately 86%
of our current land pipeline included some form of deferred land payment terms. In these arrangements, rather
than paying for the land up front, payments are typically structured with deferred payments to be made either on
fixed dates, on a “pay per plot” sold basis or in instalments tied to milestones such as the sale of a defined
cumulative number of plots or similar development milestones. In addition, some of our arrangements with
development partners include overage mechanisms, whereby we make additional payments to the development
partner following completion of the land sale contingent upon exceeding agreed financial thresholds, with such
payments often deferred to the end of the development of a site or a significant phase of the development.
Together, these deferred payment obligations and overage obligations comprise our land creditor commitments.
See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Commitments and Contingent Liabilities—Land Creditor
_Commitments” below for further details of our land creditor commitments as of July 31, 2021._

We believe that our land creditor profile provides us with an element of risk mitigation, as the majority
of our payments are linked to development delivery milestones rather than needing to be made up front. Our land
creditor commitments are unwound as the relevant payments for these deferred land costs fall due and are made
from period to period.

Our results of operations during each period will therefore be affected by a variety of factors related to
land procurement, including the number of developments, the number of completions and the structure of the


-----

partnership arrangement (in particular, whether we are acquiring the land, whether the drawdown is in phases and
whether there are deferred payment terms).

**_The Planning Approval Process_**

The development of land is partly driven by the timing of the planning approval process, including the
receipt of those consents which are required to deliver proposed schemes. The overall timeframe for completing
the planning approval process affects how quickly we are able to realize revenue from our developments, and any
complications that arise during the planning process can increase our costs, including those related to third party
planning experts. The planning approval process typically takes from six to twelve months, depending on the
complexity of the application and may take a longer or shorter amount of time.

We are required to comply with national, local and other laws and regulations and administrative
requirements and policies relating to, among other things, planning, developing, building and land use. In addition,
we are required to obtain numerous permits and approvals from local authorities and other regulatory bodies
regarding, among other things, remediation, roads, drainage, utilities, including gas, electricity and water, and
waste removal as well as UK Town & Country Planning Act obligations. These requirements are more complex
when we are developing brownfield sites.

Of the 24,654 plots in our land pipeline as of July 31, 2021, approximately 19,400, or 79%, benefit from
a planning permission, of which 66% have a detailed planning consent and 13% have an outline planning consent.
The remaining 21% currently do not benefit from a planning consent. Of our estimated completions for the
financial year ending October 31, 2021, 100% have planning permission in place.

**_Relationships with Homes England, Local Authorities, other Public and Private Land Owners and Registered_**
**_Providers_**

Due to our partnership model, our success depends substantially on our reputation and ability to maintain
strong relationships with public and private land owners as well as Registered Providers. In particular, we benefit
from strong, long-standing relationships with both public bodies (including Homes England, Local Authorities
and charitable organizations, and Registered Providers) and private land owners, and 79% of the plots in our land
pipeline as of July 31, 2021 were being developed under the partnership model. These relationships are built
through a successful track-record of delivering projects, a reputation for aligning our approach with our partners’
objectives and a deep understanding of the motivations beyond financial returns that are key to these partners,
including social value, sustainability, accelerated delivery and design quality. Working with public sector partners
also provides us with the potential to access grant funding and investment support (particularly from Homes
England and Local Authority partners) to facilitate the development of land that would otherwise be unviable to
develop.

Partnership projects are typically awarded by public bodies through competitive public procurement
processes, often based on the Local Authority’s or housing association’s perception of a developer’s expertise,
track record and experience with regeneration projects, design quality, reputation, price and value. Our largest
delivery partner is Homes England, we have been a member of all successive DPPs to date (DPP 1, 2 and 3) and
we are one of the most active developers on DPP3. As of July 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our land pipeline
was secured through the Homes England DPP process. In each of these public procurement processes, we tailor
our bids in accordance with the bidding criteria released by the authority, and we believe that we enjoy a significant
advantage against many competing bidders by virtue of our deep understanding of the public procurement process,
combined with our experience and track record of delivering notable regeneration and development projects
aligning with the social goals of public sector partners.

Our partnership model and our focus on working with partners in the affordable end of the housing
market allow us to achieve capital light land sourcing and site development, with typically lower land prices and
favorable (often deferred) payment terms, as well as the ability to access grant funding.

We also experience a number of benefits from our work with Registered Providers, including (i) the use
of multi-tenure housing (such as share ownership homes), which provide a natural complement to our open market
sales; (ii) resilience through the economic cycle as Registered Providers are well funded by the UK Government;
(iii) a capital efficient workstream, with Registered Providers often paying incrementally, but in advance for
homes as they are built, often with a significant upfront deposit which thereby strengthens our project ROCE; (iv)
the potential for additional elective sales during the development of a site on attractive financial terms which
provide additional revenue visibility; and (v) strong appetite for homes from Registered Providers who then in


-----

turn generate strong commercial offers typically close to full open market value (outside of the sales pursuant to
Section 106 obligations, which are often at a significant discount to open market value).

As a result of our use of the partnership model, our relationships with Homes England, other public and
private land owners and Registered Providers have a significant impact on the development opportunities available
to us and, therefore, the number of homes that we sell and our revenues from period to period. As a result, our
reputation and relationships with Homes England and key Local Authorities are critical to our success.

**_The Availability and Affordability of UK Residential Mortgages_**

Home purchases in the UK are often facilitated through mortgage lending, and 89% and 91% of our
homes that were sold through private sales were purchased by customers with the assistance of mortgages in the
financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. A large proportion of buyers of our homes are
first-time buyers, who are especially dependent upon the availability of mortgages. As a result, the UK mortgage
market and the availability of financing options directly impact our customers’ ability to secure long-term
financing to purchase our homes. Our revenue is therefore directly influenced by the willingness of banks to lend
to customers at affordable rates and any change in available mortgage products can have a significant impact on
our revenue. Reduced availability of affordable mortgage financing and factors that increase the upfront or
monthly cost of financing the purchase of a home, including increases in interest rates, insurance premiums or
taxes or other charges associated with the purchase or ownership of a home, all impact the affordability of, and
therefore the level of demand for, the homes that we build.

The general UK economy significantly influences interest rates and, subsequently, mortgage rates. The
continuing availability of a wide range of mortgage financing options and low interest rates has in recent years
ensured that funding remains affordable in the markets where we are focused. During the period under review,
the Bank of England base rate has ranged from 0.75% to 0.1%. However, increases in the base rate have previously
had a negative impact on the UK property market because interest rates charged on mortgages increased
correspondingly, thereby making home purchases less affordable for prospective buyers. Prospective buyers who
can obtain a mortgage at current interest rates may be deterred by the possibility of increased rates (and, in turn,
higher monthly interest payments) in the future and instead elect to remain in their current property or to continue
renting. Higher mortgage interest rates would likely have an adverse impact on our transaction volumes and the
revenue derived from them.

Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK Finance estimated that UK gross mortgage
lending would fall by an estimated 13% in 2020, to £233 billion, and that it would fall to £215 billion in 2021
before recovering to £230 billion by 2022. However, recent mortgage approval data suggests that mortgage
lending in 2021 could be stronger than those estimates indicate, as approvals in the seven months ended July 31,
2021 averaged 84,735 (78% ahead of the comparative period a year prior, which was undisturbed by the COVID19 pandemic).

In terms of affordability, Nationwide estimate that first-time buyers in the UK spent an average of 31.7%
of mean take-home pay on mortgage payments in the fourth quarter of 2020. This compares to the average since
1983 of 33.1%, a low of 17.5% in 1996 and a high of 55.8% in the fourth quarter of 1989. This demonstrates that
while first-time buyer house price-to-earnings multiples are close to an all-time high (5.2x at the end of 2020)
mortgage rates are low in a historic context, reflecting low base rates. The price-to-earnings multiple is also highly
dependent upon region, with average multiples of 5.2x for the North East and 5.7x for the North West, compared
to 12.4x for London and the surrounding areas. Lower price-to-earnings multiples indicate greater affordability,
and our business is focused principally upon the more affordable regions which are characterized by lower priceto-earnings ratios. We believe that our business is less sensitive to these spreads given our relatively low ASP
and, currently, the support of the HTB scheme for first-time buyers, with rates on offer under the scheme trending
at approximately 1.7% for three- and five-year fixed rate periods in 2021. However, the HTB scheme is currently
scheduled to expire in 2023 and it remains unclear whether the scheme will be extended (and, if it is extended,
whether it will be modified) and what impact an expiry or modification would have on the affordability of
mortgages for the first-time buyer market.

The housebuilding sector and lenders are currently exploring new low-deposit mortgage products to
provide additional alternatives for buyers, including a product backed by a mortgage indemnity scheme developed
by the Home Builders Federation and other market participants that will offer 95% LTV mortgages for new homes.
Upon completion of home purchases offered as part of the scheme, the developer pays a percentage of the purchase
price into an insurance policy, which reduces risk for the lender. This scheme is currently being piloted in the


-----

North East of the UK but is expected to be rolled out more widely across the UK in 2021 should the trial prove to
be successful.

Any changes in the availability of mortgage financing, interest rates or lending guidelines or other factors
that increase the upfront or monthly cost of financing a home could impact both the demand for our homes and
their pricing, which will, in turn, affect our revenue and profitability.

**_Government Purchase Assistance Schemes_**

As a UK housebuilder with a particular focus on the affordable end of the UK housing market and firsttime buyers, our results of operations are significantly affected by the level and nature of Government purchase
assistance schemes.

Since 2016, the UK Government has focused its approach on providing additional new homes through a
number of policy statements and initiatives including an increase in its capital funding for its Affordable Homes
Programme, a £1 billion loan scheme to support SME housebuilders, confirmation of HTB funding and additional
capital for various funds, including the “Housing Infrastructure Fund,” the “Land Release Fund” and the “Planning
Delivery Fund.” In addition, the UK government is currently targeting to build 300,000 new homes a year by the
mid-2020s, a goal that has significant cross-party support. In June 2021, the UK Government launched a new
initiative called “First Homes” will extend the tenures being offered through local authorities planning policy for
affordable housing. The First Homes initiative offers first-time buyers the opportunity to buy a home at a discount
(minimum 30%) in perpetuity subject to meeting local and key work eligibility criteria.

These stimulus measures make it easier for us to sell homes and hence have an impact on our revenue
and margins. These government programs are particularly important when traditional mortgage lenders do not
have suitable products available for, or are unwilling to provide based on their lending criteria, the full loan amount
required by home buyers.

A significant number of our customers have used HTB, a UK government equity loan scheme designed
to encourage home ownership in the UK. The HTB program provides assistance to purchasers of new-build homes
in the UK by reducing the minimum down payment required from the purchaser to 5% of a property’s value and
providing an equity loan of up to 20%, or 40% in London, of the property value (originally available up to a value
of £600,000). HTB sales represented approximately 68% of our private sales in the financial year ended October
31, 2020. The HTB scheme has been modified and extended to March 2023, but with reforms restricting the
scheme to support only first-time buyers from April 1, 2021 onwards and with regional price caps ranging from
£186,100 in the North East to £600,000 in London. As a result of these reforms, non-first-time buyers who
previously would have been able to secure funding through the HTB scheme are no longer eligible to do so, which
in turn could have an adverse impact on our home sales. In addition, the HTB scheme remains subject to future
regulatory changes, including to applicable eligibility criteria, and such changes may affect the availability of
government funding of mortgages, which in turn may affect public demand in the homes market. It is not currently
known whether the HTB scheme will be extended after 2023 or, if it is extended, how it may be modified, or
whether any other similar UK Government-backed program will continue at current levels, or at all, or that lenders
will participate in them. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business— A majority of our business is secured
_or supported either directly or indirectly from various Government sources, and changes in local or Government_
_funds, loans, grants or subsidies, or changes to or the discontinuation of mortgage assistance schemes or equity_
_loan schemes (including in particular Help to Buy) could significantly impact our business.”_

Scotland has a separate program (Help to Buy (Scotland)), and its “Affordable New Build Scheme”
available to larger housebuilders (including Keepmoat) stopped accepting new applications on February 5, 2021.
However, we believe that this has not had a material effect on demand for our homes in Scotland.

The availability of funding for these programs remains subject to governmental decisions. In the future,
governments and/or local bodies may change their priorities and programs, for example, by reducing or amending
mortgage assistance schemes, or undertaking welfare reforms that may impact funding stability for housing
associations and local authorities. Any reduction or discontinuation of UK Government-backed home purchase
assistance programs in the future may make it more difficult for our core first-time buyer customers to afford
homes, which would make it more difficult for us to sell homes and may force us to either lower prices or increase
purchase incentives.

**_Product Mix and ASPs_**

Our profitability is influenced by the number of legal completions we achieve and the margin we earn
on those completions. The margins we earn can vary significantly and depend on the underlying profitability of
the projects, the types of homes sold and the location of the sites. Therefore, our results can be significantly
affected by product mix and regional mix.

In terms of product mix, our results are affected in particular by the split between open market sales and
sales to Registered Providers. We pursue a strategy that blends the potential of margin enhancement through
higher-margin open-market sales with the certainty, risk mitigation and cash generation of selling to Registered
Providers for affordable rent and shared ownership housing. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, we sold
74% of our plots on the open market (which includes sales to private customers as well as elective sales to
Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a site), with 26% to Registered Providers as part
of Section 106 affordable housing obligations in connection with planning consents or otherwise agreed with
Registered Providers at the outset of development. In comparison, in the financial year ended October 31, 2019,
we sold 78% of our plots in the open market and 22% to Registered Providers. Although the sales prices of homes
sold to Registered Providers pursuant to Section 106 affordable housing obligations are typically lower than open
market sales, and involve lower margins, the sales often involve the Registered Providers forward funding these,
both providing revenue visibility and reducing the working capital needs of sites. In addition, this enables us to
use the cash proceeds from such sales to accelerate delivery of site outputs, ultimately generating an enhanced
ROCE. In addition to the sales in connection with Section 106 obligations, we are able to agree additional sales
to Registered Providers either at the outset of a development (in which case we categorize these as Registered
Provider sales, alongside the sales pursuant to Section 106 obligations) or as elective sales during the development
of a site (in which case we categorize these as open market sales). In either case, for sales outside of Section 106
obligations the Registered Providers are able to utilize Affordable Homes Programme funding, which helps to
generate attractive commercial offers. In particular, elective sales agreed during the development of a site are
benchmarked against other open market sale opportunities and are often at only a small discount to the open
market price.

Our results are also affected by the regional mix of sales among our nine regions, with some of our
regions having higher ASPs than other regions. For example, in the nine months ended July 31, 2021, our regional
ASPs ranged from £138,000 in our North West MCI region to £221,000 in our South Midlands region. Our results
may therefore vary from period to period as we expand our operations in certain regions and based on the location
of the development opportunities available to us in each period.

While our product mix and regional mix is largely within our control, we are impacted by external factors,
in particular the availability of planning consents and government policy.

In the near term, our margins are also affected by site mix, reflecting the fact that current management
has implemented an enhanced land sourcing process that we believe has resulted in a progressively increasing mix
of higher quality, better procured sites. For example, for sites under development that were approved between
2017 and 2019 (excluding the North West MCI region), average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development
Margins for each year of approval range from approximately 22% to 23% by year, whereas for sites either
approved since 2020 or within our secured pipeline and to be approved, average forecasted full-site-life Gross
Development Margins for each year of approval or for the “to be approved” category, range from approximately
24% to 25% by year or category. This is an increase from the average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development
Margins for sites under development that were approved in 2016 and pre-2016, for which average forecasted fullsite-life Gross Development Margins are approximately 21% and 18%, respectively.

**_Our Cost Base, including the Supply and Cost of Sub-contractors and Materials_**

A significant portion of our cost of sales relate to the costs of building our housing developments,
including the costs of raw materials and labor. Factors outside our control, including raw materials prices and
wage costs, can have a material impact on these costs and, accordingly, our financial results.

We sub-contract a large proportion of the actual construction of our developments to third-party
providers and therefore our ability to source sub-contractors that meet our strict quality requirements and rate/price
expectations are important to our business. We compete for labor with our competitors in the housebuilding sector
and with housebuilders in other sectors and, therefore, changes in the labor market directly impact our costs. The
concentration of our sub-contractors is low. This diversification reduces our exposure to individual subcontractor


-----

risk. In addition, in order to reduce risks of subcontractor rate increases on developments, we typically aim to lock
in subcontractor prices over a phase, or part-phase, of a development through “all risk” contracts.

We are directly exposed to the cyclicality of the construction industry, which impacts the labor market.
During periods of market contraction, pools of labor leave the market, sometimes permanently, for example to
retrain in other professions or move abroad in search of work. During periods of increased construction activity,
competition among housebuilders for qualified labor increases and the associated impact on labor rates and
availability can impact us, and result in materially higher labor costs. This has been demonstrated during the
current financial year, with high levels of construction activity in the UK housebuilding sector giving rise to
increasing competition for skilled labor and a consequential increase in labor costs.

We are also affected by our ability to source sufficient materials at competitive prices. The cyclicality of
the construction industry also impacts the supply of materials so that in times of market contraction, production
is scaled back and therefore when markets recover there can be a lag on supply which pushes prices upwards.
More generally, periods of increased construction activity can give rise to demand and supply imbalances which
tend to increase construction costs. For example, a significant increase in UK housebuilding activity during the
current financial year has resulted in a significant increase in demand for construction materials and a lengthening
of supplier delivery times. Data released by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy indicated
that the overall cost of materials for new housing was 6.7% higher in January 2021 than in January 2020. An IHS
Markit/Cips UK survey published in May 2021 indicated that input-cost inflation had increased for the seventh
month in a row to its highest level since the survey began in April 1997, with steel and timber experiencing
particularly sharp price rises.

We seek to mitigate any supply shortages and cost inflation risk by having strong supplier relationships
that can meet our demands. Our material supply-chain strategy is underpinned by annual, Group-wide deals with
suppliers with national coverage. This enables us to negotiate better commercial terms through consolidated
volume and enables the utilization of volume-related rebates. We operate a series of group-wide, long-term
strategic frameworks providing preferential commercial terms and service levels nationally and regionally for
supply of materials, site equipment and business consumables. Our supply chain team manage over 96
arrangements which are made up of framework agreements, commercial arrangements and formal price lists. In
the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 88% of our direct spend was channeled through these frameworks.

Our use of standardized designs helps to reduce and improve the predictability of costs, improves
construction build times and quality and continues to provide us with the flexibility to utilize our skills and
experience in design and place-making by tailoring aspects of our standardized designs to each particular
development. Although the amount of homes built using our standardized type varies from year to year, in the
financial year ended October 31, 2020, 88% of our homes were build using a standardized house type. We believe
that our shift to increased construction standardization can help reduce costs and build times while continuing to
allow us to utilize our skills and experience in design and place-making.

We also seek to mitigate the risk of price rises through the use of phased viability in developments where
possible, allowing increased build costs to be included in future phases following updated viability assessments,
facilitating the delivery of our required financial returns if the cost base increases on subsequent phases. This
mechanism mitigates the impact of cost increases on future phases, but does not affect cost increases during the
construction of a particular phase.

Our supply chain and costs could also be affected by political events, such as the ongoing effects of
Brexit. We have worked closely with our supply chain since the Brexit vote to ensure that we understand the
changes arising from Brexit. We have continued with this close engagement since the confirmation of the new
trade arrangements to understand their challenges and contingency strategies. These include careful monitoring,
increasing UK stock holding and diverting imports to alternative UK ports where bottlenecks are predicted. At
this stage, we have not experienced any significant supply chain issues associated with Brexit.

Central overhead costs (including central administrative personnel as well as non-personnel overhead
costs for central office rental and rates as well as IT costs, insurance, audit, legal, tax and other consultancy
services and other expenses) represented 3% and 4% of our revenue in the years ended October 31, 2019 and
2020, respectively, while regional overhead costs (including regional administrative personnel as well as nonpersonnel overhead costs for regional office rental and rates and other expenses) represented 6% and 8% of our
revenue.


-----

Our overhead has risen in recent years as a result of our expansion into new regions. However, as our
operations in these regions mature, we expect to capture greater operational efficiencies and reduce overhead costs
as a percentage of revenue, enhancing our profit margins. We expect this decrease in overhead costs as a
percentage of revenue will be driven principally by efficiencies of scale in growth regions and central overheads.

We have also made significant investments in personnel at both the regional and head office level to
support our growth and build a national platform for future expansion in our target geographies. Margins have
remained stable over this period and we have proven our ability to invest and grow scale.

**_Seasonality_**

Historically, our revenues and levels of working capital have varied during the year due to peaks of
completions in certain months of the year. As a consequence, our debt profile has exhibited peaks and troughs
over the course of the financial year consistent with seasonal trends.

The timing of completions within a financial year is influenced by a number of factors. Typically, the
majority of our reservations for open market sales are made in January to March and August to October (with the
latter correlated to the start of the new school year). Our ability to manage the timeline from the engagement and
planning phase to the exchange of contract and legal completion is, therefore, one of the factors that affects the
timing of completions. Although we generally have a significant degree of flexibility in managing the phasing of
completions and typically aim to stagger the timing of our completions to the extent practicable, the impact of
weather on building activity and plot delivery has also tended to favor a peak in completions in the late summer
and early autumn.

In addition, prior to the change of the KM Group’s financial year end from March 31 to October 31 in
2018, divisional efforts to achieve targets and maximize sales for the financial year end led to a peak of
completions in March. This had an effect on our results of operations for the financial year ended October 31,
2019, as our incentive scheme for that financial year remained tied to an end date of March 31. However, we do
not expect this to have an impact on our financial results in any subsequent years. For the financial year ended
October 31, 2021 we have amended our incentive targets to include an additional measure tied to half-year targets,
in order to achieve a more levelled number of completions throughout the financial year.

The above factors may lead to volatility in our quarterly financial results. These factors that affect the
phasing of completions through a financial year tend to result in a weighting of plot completions, and accordingly
revenue and profit, to the last quarter of financial years. Results of a single fiscal quarter or half year might
therefore not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a full financial year and may not be comparable with the
results in the other fiscal quarters or half year. Factors that affect our peak selling seasons can have a
disproportionate impact on our performance in a particular period.

**Factors Affecting Future Results of Operations**

**_The Transactions_**

On August 4, 2021, the Company entered into the Acquisition Agreement with the Sellers pursuant to
which, among other things, the Company agreed to indirectly acquire 100% of the share capital of the Target. The
Acquisition will be consummated on or about October 27, 2021.

The Group is incurring £275.0 million of new debt to (i) fund the consideration payable for the
Acquisition, (ii) repay Existing Target Indebtedness, (iii) repay Sellers transaction costs, and (iv) pay the fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. As of July 31, 2021, after giving _pro forma effect to the_
Transactions as if they had occurred on that date, the Group’s total third party borrowings would have been the
£292.6 million in debt represented by the Notes, certain lease liabilities and amounts drawn under the Existing
Senior Term Facility. As a result of this increase in third party borrowings, the Company’s interest expense will
increase for future periods.

**Factors Affecting Comparability**

**_Change of Financial Year End from March 31 to October 31_**

In 2018, the KM Group changed its financial year end from March 31 to October 31. As a consequence,
the financial year ended October 31, 2018 consists of the seven month period from April 1, 2018 to October 31,


-----

2018 and therefore is not directly comparable with the prior and subsequent financial years of the KM Group,
which cover twelve month periods.

**_Changes to Accounting Principles_**

_IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers)_

IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) was issued in 2014 and was endorsed by the EU in
2016. IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) establishes a comprehensive framework for determining
whether, how much and when revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including
IAS 18 (Revenue). IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) is effective for annual periods beginning
on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.

We adopted IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) from April 1, 2018 in accordance with
the fully retrospective transitional approach without using the practical expedients for completed contracts or for
modified contracts. We have applied the expedient allowing both non-disclosure of the amount of the transaction
price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, and an explanation of when it expects to recognize that
amount as revenue for all reporting periods presented before the date of initial application.

Under IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), revenue is recognized based on indicators of
control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This can lead to differences in revenue
recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. The majority of our revenue
and profit, including revenue from open market sales, continues to be recognized on legal completion. For those
sites in respect of which stage payments are received from Registered Providers, revenue is recognized based on
stage of completion rather than on legal completion.

IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) also sets out the requirements for recognition of noncash consideration as revenue. Previously, where we entered into arrangements to provide housing to Registered
Providers at below open market value in exchange for discounted land from partners, the associated housing unit
revenue was recorded at open market value. IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) does not permit
this, as the exchange transaction (land discount from partner) is not received directly from the customer (the
Registered Provider) and so does not meet the criteria of non-cash consideration. This change has the impact of
reducing reported revenue. Accordingly, the revenue recognized in respect of these housing units will be equal to
the cash consideration received from Registered Providers, with no open market value adjustment. There are a
limited number of developments where the eventual buyer of the affordable units is the same entity as the land
vendor. In these instances, the discount received represents non-cash consideration, which continues to be
recognized as revenue.

_IFRS 16 (Leases)_

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16
(Leases) on November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 (Leases) replaced IAS 17 (Leases) and the related International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee’s and the Standards Interpretation Committee’s interpretations, and results
in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases
is eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a
financial liability to pay lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. IFRS 16
(Leases) is effective for fiscal years commencing on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted if
IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) has also been applied.

We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) from November 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Under
this approach, comparative information is not restated and the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16
(Leases) is recognized in retained earnings at the date of initial application. In particular, as a consequence of
IFRS 16 (Leases) our total assets and liabilities increased as the right of use asset associated with leases and the
corresponding liability, which were previously treated as operating leases, are recognized on the balance sheet. In
addition, operating lease expenditure has been reclassified and split between depreciation and finance cost, and as
a result, our EBITDA increased.

IFRS 16 (Leases) was effective for the financial year ended October 31, 2020. The impact of adopting
IFRS 16 (Leases) for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was the recognition of right of use assets of £8.0
million and lease liabilities of £8.6 million on transition in respect of offices, company vehicles, site plant
equipment and show homes. The impact on Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was


-----

£0.6 million. This information may not be indicative of the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases) on our
total assets, total liabilities and EBITDA for the next financial year or any future period.

**_Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic_**

Our financial performance during the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was affected significantly
by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of program disruption and the costs of operating with COVID-19 working
practices and social-distancing measures, our delivery volumes declined significantly given construction activity
was significantly stalled from April through August 2020, our margins declined slightly compared to the financial
year ended October 31, 2019 and our EBIT and ROCE performance eroded significantly.

However, as demonstrated by our performance for the nine months ended July 31, 2021 and our forward
order book, we have recovered strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe that we are well positioned
to deliver on our planned growth in the medium term. We have benefitted from a robust UK housing market, with
a favorable mortgage environment, ongoing government support and strong demand, against the resilient
economic backdrop during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the strict lockdown measures that were imposed through April 2021, for the twelve months ended
July 31, 2021, our Adjusted EBIT and ROCE increased 12.8% and 150 basis points, respectively, as compared to
the financial year ended October 31, 2019.

We believe our financial results in recent quarters demonstrates the resiliency and strength of our
business model. The COVID-19 lockdown restrictions imposed in March 2020 caused our financial performance
to decline but did not stress our overall financial profile given the lower risk inherent in our partnership model. In
addition, during the financial year ended October 31, 2020, £24.4 million in partner payments were deferred,
representing approximately 80% of our total commitments, which illustrates the flexible land creditor profile we
maintain.

**Description of Statement of Comprehensive Income Items**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is recognized based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are
transferred. This can lead to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual
arrangements in place.

The majority of our revenue and profit, including revenue from open market sales, is recognized at legal
completion. For those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from Registered Providers (which are
government approved organizations that provides Affordable Housing, including Housing Associations, Local
Authorities and private companies) for the provision of housing or where we undertake development contracts,
revenue is recognized based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. We consider the provision of
land and residential properties to represent a single performance obligation which represents a judgement taken
in the application of IFRS 15.

_Sale of Housing to Open Market Customers_

Revenue and profits associated with these activities are recognized in the statement of comprehensive
income on legal completion. Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognized at the fair value
of the consideration received or receivable upon legal completion. Open market sale plots are recognized at the
agreed sales price which is deemed to be fair value.

_Sale of Housing to Registered Provider Customers and Associated Development Contracts (with Stage Payments)_

We construct and sell residential properties and undertake associated development activities under longterm contracts with customers. Such contracts are entered into before construction of residential properties or
associated development activities begin. Under the terms of the contracts, we are restricted from redirecting the
properties or development works to another customer and have an enforceable right to payment for work done.
Revenue from construction of residential properties and associated development activities is therefore recognized
over time based on a certified monthly valuation of work performed or the assessed physical stage of completion
at the balance sheet date. We consider that this method is an appropriate measure of the progress towards complete
satisfaction of these performance obligations under IFRS 15.

sales based on remaining plots to be sold at each site;

      - architectural and engineering fees associated with the design of each site;

      - build costs, including direct labor, sub-contractors and materials, which are also recognized as

of losses exceeds our equity accounted investment in a joint venture, the carrying value of the equity interest is
reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued.

**_Adjusted Operating Profit/(Loss)_**

Adjusted operating profit represents gross profit for the applicable period less administrative expenses
plus other operating income for such period plus the share of results of equity accounted as part of our joint
ventures and associates and excludes exceptional items and amortization of acquisition related intangibles.

October 31, 2019 to £406.0 million for the financial year ended October 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily
due to the impact of the lockdown and other restrictions on the ability to complete sales.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales decreased by £189.2 million, or 35.7%, from £530.6 million for the financial year ended
October 31, 2019 to £341.4 million for the financial year ended October 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily
due to lower activity levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin also decreased due to loss of plot sales
from slower build rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

31, 2020.

_Exceptional Items_

Exceptional items increased by £3.1 million, from a £1.3 million benefit for the financial year ended
October 31, 2019 to a £1.8 million charge for the financial year ended October 31, 2020. This increase was
primarily driven by a lease provision writeback of £1.3 million in the financial year ended October 31, 2019 and
restructuring and professional advisor fees incurred in the financial year ended October 31, 2020.

_Amortisation of Acquisition Related Intangible Assets_

Finance expense increased by £3.7 million, or 16.4%, from £22.5 million for the financial year ended
October 31, 2019 to £26.2 million for the financial year ended October 31, 2020. This increase was primarily
driven by a full year of interest paid on the new financing facility implemented in the previous year, as well as an
increase in our deferred land payment charge of £1.5 million and additional interest charge of £0.5 million as a
result of the implementation of IFRS 16.

_(Loss)/Profit Before Tax_

For the reasons set out above, (loss)/profit before tax decreased by £55.2 million, from a profit of £37.2
million for the financial year ended October 31, 2019 to a loss of £18.0 million for the financial year ended October
31, 2020.

year ended October 31, 2019 to a credit of £4.7 million for the financial year ended October 31, 2020. This increase
was primarily driven by a loss before tax that was incurred in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 as
compared to a profit before tax in the prior year.


-----

_(Loss)/Profit for the Period_

For the reasons set out above, (loss)/profit for the period decreased by £43.6 million, from a profit of
£30.3 million for the financial year ended October 31, 2019 to a loss of £13.3 million for the financial year ended

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash
requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service
obligations, other commitments, contractual obligations and acquisitions. Liquidity risk is the risk that we would
be unable to meet our current and future financial obligations as they fall due or can do so only at excessive cost.

During the period under review, our primary sources of liquidity were cash flows generated from our
operations, along with short- and long-term borrowings. Following the completion of this Offering, our primary
sources of liquidity will be our cash from operating activities and the Revolving Credit Facility. Our principal
liquidity requirements arise from the need to fund land acquisitions, capital expenditure, labor and raw materials
costs and operating expenses for projects and debt service obligations.

As of July 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalent balances of £45.2 million.

**_Cash Flows_**

The following table sets forth our cash flow information for the periods presented.

**For the nine**

**For the financial years ended** **months ended**

_Total Cash Inflows/(Outflows) From Operating Activities_

Total cash inflows/(outflows) from operating activities increased by £0.8 million, or 26.7%, from an
outflow of £3.0 million in the nine months ended July 31, 2020 to an outflow of £2.2 million for the nine months
ended July 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows before changes in
working capital of £20.2 million offset by an increase in working capital outflows of £18.1 million and a further
£1.3 million increase in tax paid..

Total cash inflows/(outflows) from operating activities decreased by £2.9 million, or 7.2%, from an
inflow of £40.1 million in the financial year ended October 31, 2019 to an inflow of £37.2 million for the financial
year ended October 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in operating cash flows before
changes in working capital of £47.0 million offset by an increase in working capital inflows of £41.1 million and
a further £3.0 million decrease in tax paid.

_Total Cash Inflows/(Outflows) From Investing Activities_

Total cash inflows/(outflows) from investing activities decreased by £2.8 million, or 311.1%, from an
outflow of £0.9 million in the nine months ended July 31, 2020 to an outflow of £3.7 million for the nine months
ended July 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the cash outflow of £2.0 million associated with the
acquisition of 50% of the members’ capital holding in BK Scotswood LLP.

Total cash inflows/(outflows) from investing activities decreased by £0.1 million, or 7.7%, from an
outflow of £1.3 million in the financial year ended October 31, 2019 to an outflow of £1.2 million for the financial
year ended October 31, 2020.


-----

_Total Cash Inflows/(Outflows) From Financing Activities_

Total cash inflows/(outflows) from financing activities decreased by £35.7 million from an inflow of
£22.7 million in the nine months ended July 31, 2020 to an outflow of £13.0 million for the nine months ended
July 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to net drawdowns of the Revolving Credit Facility and the term
loan of £25.0 million and £7.5 million, respectively in the nine months ended July 31, 2020.

Total cash inflows/(outflows) from financing activities increased by £4.9 million, or 51.6%, from an
inflow of £9.5 million in the financial year ended October 31, 2019 to an inflow of £14.4 million for the financial
year ended October 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to IFRS 16 lease payments of £3.5 million on
adoption of IFRS 16 in the year ended October 31, 2020.

**_Capital Resources_**

Following the Offering and use of proceeds therefrom, our principal sources of funds are expected to be
cash provided by ongoing operations and the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Working Capital_**

We define changes in working capital as the sum of changes in accrued/deferred income, changes in
receivables, changes in subcontractor and supplier payables and other creditors, accruals, provisions, debtors and
prepayments, and changes in land and build WIP resulting from the cash flows statement. Our working capital
requirements are driven by timing of land payments, plot completions, build WIP and supplier and subcontractor
terms. Accrued and deferred income consists of stage payments from Registered Providers, Local Authorities and
other housing associations. Payables mainly include invoices from sub-contractors and suppliers. Our contract
provisions typically provide for accruals for subcontractor work completed and materials supplied that have not
been invoiced.

The amount of working capital required to service our operations is closely monitored and controlled and
forms a key part of the management information reviewed on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Current assets
mainly comprise trade receivables, WIP and land held for the development of private housing and affordable
housing through partnership schemes. As our trade receivables relate mainly to public sector and housing
association clients, there is no significant history of bad or doubtful debts.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditure requirements are relatively low and primarily comprise investments in IT and
computer equipment.

Capital expenditure for the nine months ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 was £1.7 million and £1.0 million,
respectively. Capital expenditure for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 was £1.3 million and for the
financial year ended October 31, 2019 was £0.8 million.

**_Off-balance Sheet Arrangements_**

We have entered into certain performance guarantees in the normal course of business, which as of July
31, 2021, amounted to £18.2 million (£22.7 million as of October 31, 2020). In our opinion, no losses will arise
in respect of these guarantees.

**_Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments_**

The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of July 31, 2021 on an as adjusted
basis after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and the related amounts falling due within one year and
thereafter.

(1) Operating leases refers to the leasing of show home properties, office space, cars and plant hire used in construction and development.
Operating leases are presented on the basis of gross cash commitments as they become due, which differs from the presentation of
operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet, which is prepared on a discounted basis.

(2) Non-cancellable contracts for purchase of land is presented on the basis of gross cash commitments as they become due, which differs
from the presentation of non-cancellable contracts for purchase of land on our consolidated balance sheet, which is prepared on a
discounted basis.

(3) Payments are not tied to specific dates but rather the performance of certain milestones. Maturity is forecasted based on expected plot
completions and other performance obligations.

Our obligations to land creditors were £217.9 million as of July 31, 2021, and are recorded as
“development land payables” within “trade and other payables” on our balance sheet. Development land payables
includes (i) lease liabilities where we have acquired the right to develop land under a build lease, (ii) contractual
obligations to pay for land on deferred payment terms and (iii) accrued overage agreements in relation to our profit
agreements with land vendors, which will only become payable if agreed financial thresholds are met. Overage
payable is estimated based on expected future cash flows in relation to relevant developments and, where payment
will take place in more than one year, is discounted.

Development land payables are recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition of the asset to which
they relate and subsequently held at amortized cost. The discount to the nominal value is amortized over the period
of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate. Changes in estimates of the final
payment due are taken to inventory (land held for and under development) and in due course, to cost of sales in
the income statement. Changes to the timing of any deferred payments are taken to finance costs.

The table below sets forth a breakdown of the timing of our current and non-current development land
payables by year:

**As of October 31,** **July 31,**
**2019** **2020** **2021**
**(£ in millions)**
Non-current development land payables .................................................... 89.6 100.9 127.5
Current development land payables ........................................................... 49.5 57.5 72.7
**Total ..........................................................................................................** 139.1 158.4 200.2

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates, house prices and foreign
exchange rates will affect our income or the value of our financial instruments.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as and when they fall
due. Our objective is to manage liquidity by ensuring that we will always have sufficient liquidity to meet our


-----

liabilities as they become due. This is assessed under normal and stress conditions, without incurring losses or
risking damage to our reputation.

In connection with the Transactions, we will establish the Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of £70
million.

We believe we have a rigorous cash management processes. Cash balances are reported daily with
detailed analysis of variances to short term cash forecasts. Short term cash forecasts are updated monthly and for
a period of 26 weeks, with the first eight weeks on a daily basis and the remaining 18 weeks on a weekly basis.
These complement our minimum of four long term quarterly cash forecasts each year which are compared to the
annual cash flow budget and to previous quarterly forecasts. These facilitate management’s assessments of our
expected cash performance and to compare to the facilities available and our covenants.

Key risks to liquidity and cash balances are a decrease in the value of open market sales, a downturn in
the UK housing market, deterioration in credit terms obtainable in the market from suppliers and subcontractors,
a downturn in the profitability of work, delayed receipt of cash from customers and a general decline in the ability
of local authorities to fund urban regeneration projects.

In order to mitigate this risk we continually monitor open market house sales volumes and prices;
continuous monitoring of working capital levels and contract profitability and the review of client and supplier
credit references and credit terms with clients and suppliers to ensure they continue to be appropriate.

We do not have any derivative financial liabilities.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Interest rate risk relates to the impact of interest rate increases on our floating rate borrowing. We hold
facilities at floating interest rates at a margin over LIBOR. Our floating rate financing has increased our liquidity
but has also increased our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. While the risk of increased interest rates are
beyond our control, we continually keep our exposure under review.

**_Housing Market Risk_**

We are affected by price fluctuations of the UK housing market. The market is impacted by consumer
demand and employment levels and is dependent on the availability of mortgage finance. Furthermore,
Government incentives, including the Help to Buy scheme, have helped to stimulate consumer demand. While
these risks are beyond our ultimate control, we have mitigated certain elements of this risk by diversifying across
differing business activities and geographical regions.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk relates to our risk of financial loss if a customer fails to meet their contractual obligations.
The risk mainly arises on our trade receivables and amounts due from construction contract customers.

IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model, rather than an incurred credit loss model to be applied.
This requires the assessment of the expected credit loss on each class of financial asset at each reporting date. This
assessment takes into consideration changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset.

Our exposure to credit risk is limited for open market housebuilding activities as we typically receive
cash at the point of legal completion of our sales.

The credit risk on Registered Provider sales depends on the individual characteristics of the counterparty,
many of whom are in the public sector or are funded by the public sector (e.g., housing associations). We believe
the credit rating of these customers to be good and the credit risk on outstanding balances to be low. A highly
immaterial provision is present in all periods.

We do not have any concentration of risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract
receivables or trade receivable balances, with receivables spread across a wide range of customers.

We apply the simplified approach under IFRS 9 to measure expected credit losses associated with trade
and other receivables. The carrying value of receivables is reduced at each reporting date for any increase in the
lifetime expected credit losses with an impairment loss recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. We


-----

are of the opinion that there is a significant concentration of credit risk for those balances past due greater than
one year. As of July 31, 2021, trade receivables with a carrying amount of £2.7 million are past due (October 31,
2020: £1.8 million; October 31, 2019: £10.5 million) and £0.2 million are impaired (October 31, 2020: £0.2
million; October 31, 2019: £0.8 million).

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

We do not hedge against foreign currency exposure due to our minimal exposure to foreign currency
movements, as our business is conducted entirely in the UK and primarily in pound sterling.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

The preparation of historical financial information under IFRS requires that our management make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognized in the period in which they are revised.

The estimates and judgements that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.

**_Estimation of Development Profitability_**

The gross profit from revenue generated on each of our developments in a specific period is based on
our latest forecast for the gross profit expected to be generated over the life of that development or phase. The
expected gross profit is calculated as an output of development valuations completed using the latest selling prices
and forecasts of all land and construction costs associated with the development. These calculations of expected
gross profit require a degree of estimation due to their long-term nature and are sensitive to future movements in
both the estimated cost to complete and expected selling prices.

Our management has established internal controls to regularly review and ensure the appropriateness of
the forecasts and estimates made on an individual development basis. However, a change in estimated gross profits
over a number of developments (due, for example, to changes in estimates of costs remaining or a reduction in
average selling prices in the private market) could materially affect profitability. As an illustration, a reasonably
possible change in profits of 1% across all developments in the period to July 31, 2021 would have reduced gross
profit and net assets by an estimated £4.8 million (October 31, 2020: £4.1 million; October 31, 2019: £6.5 million).

**_Judgement Over the Right to Develop Land Under a Build Lease_**

We enter into arrangements with land owners under which we acquire an interest in land under a build
lease with the benefit of a right to develop. The directors judge these arrangements as in-substance purchases and
not leases under the scope of IFRS 16. This is on the basis that: (i) we have physical possession of the land and
have accepted the asset; (ii) the land owner has an enforceable right to payment; (iii) the freehold is passed to the
end customer; and (iv) we take on any risks associated with the land and ultimately benefit from the reward on
sale of the developed plots. On this basis, land rights acquired under these arrangements are treated as inventories
and are held at the lower of cost or net realizable value as per our accounting policy for inventories.

**_Fair Value on Share-based Payments_**

Assumptions are made in determining the fair value of employee services received in exchange for the
award of units under share-based payments awards at the date of grant, and of the likely outcome of non-market
conditions.

**INDUSTRY OVERVIEW**

**History and Overview of United Kingdom Housing Market**

Housing output in the United Kingdom has ranged between approximately 130,000 and 250,000
completions per annum since 1980, a level much lower than in the 1960s and 1970s when direct local authority
build programs pushed housing completions toward 400,000 per annum. Against this backdrop, private sector
housing completions have trended between 150,000 and 210,000 per annum since the 1960s – except for the
periods immediately following the 1970s’ recession and the global financial crisis that started in 2008 (the “GFC”)
when completions fell below this level. This is in contrast to many European countries where housebuilding rates
per person have exceeded that of the UK.

In 2004, the Government commissioned the Barker Report to conduct a review of the underlying supply
issues and responsiveness of housing in the UK, with due consideration given to the role of competition, capacity,
technology, and finances of the housebuilding industry. In addition, the report sought to explore the interplay
between these factors and the wider UK planning system in order to distinguish where shortfalls were presenting
themselves. More specifically, the review stated its key objectives as achieving: (1) improvements in housing
affordability in the market sector; (2) a more stable housing market; (3) a location of housing supply which
supports patterns of economic data; and (4) an adequate supply of publicly-funded housing for those who need it.
As the report highlighted, the aforementioned level of housebuilding fell short of the growth in household
formations and resulted in the recommendation that the UK should be building 240,000 houses per annum to
reduce the growth in house prices to zero real growth. The report also highlighted the greatest shortfall of housing
provision was within the affordable housing marketplace and recommended that greater Government subsidy in
this area was required.

While UK housebuilding rates improved post the Barker Report to 223,590 homes in 2007, the impact
of the GFC resulted in housing completions falling to a record low of 135,980 in 2010. This was compounded by
the stress in the banking sector and led to mortgage approvals for house purchases falling to approximately 26,000
in November 2008, compared to pre-GFC mortgage volumes which did not fall below 100,000 per month.

These trends in housing completions have been against the backdrop of a growing housing shortage, as
demonstrated by the following graph displaying the cumulative housing shortage in England between 2007 and
2020:

This backdrop has led to the Government taking a more active role in the UK housing market, to promote
home ownership and higher levels of housing completions. Arguably the most effective program has been the
Help to Buy equity loan scheme, which was announced in April 2013 and provides buyers who contribute deposits
of at least 5% with an interest free equity loan of up to 20% (London 40%) to help support the purchase of a new
build home. The scheme was originally intended to run until 2017, but it has been extended several times and is
now scheduled to run until March 2023 (with certain variations, including that it is available only to first-time
buyers from April 1, 2021).

The improved macroeconomic backdrop from 2013, alongside Government support, enabled
housebuilding completions to rise to 214,190 in the year to December 31, 2019, the highest level since 2007.


-----

172,010 of these were built by the private sector, 38,390 by housing associations and only 3,800 by local
authorities (compared to 415,460 total completions in 1967, 204,210 of which were built by the private sector).
This level of build still fell well short of the Government’s target to build 300,000 homes per year by the mid2020s (as announced in the Autumn Budget 2017).

The following chart shows the level of public sector and private sector new housing completions from
1969 to 2020, as compared against the Government’s current target of 300,000 homes per year:

In keeping with other industries, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented major challenges for the UK
housing market and the construction of new homes. While data for the UK is not yet available, the Ministry of
Housing, Communities and Local Government (“MHCLG”) estimates that completions and starts of new homes
in England fell 17% and 16% in the year to December 31, 2020, respectively. This reflected the substantial closure
of the UK housing market between March and May 2020 (alongside the national lockdown) and the practical
effects social distancing had upon the rate of build.

Since restrictions were eased following the first national lockdown in May 2020, housing market activity
has been strong. Total housing completions in 2020 for England totaled 148,630, a decrease of 17% compared to
the year ending December 31, 2019, despite the widespread disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic early
in the year. Nationwide and Halifax reported house price increases of 7.3% and 6.0%, respectively, in the year
ending December 31, 2020 – the strongest annual growth since 2016, demonstrating a continued momentum in
UK house prices. The following chart shows the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the nationwide house price
growth, as well as on the amount of newly agreed sales and completed transactions for the periods indicated:

The following graph shows UK nominal and real house price growth from 2000 to the first quarter of

Price Index (“RPI”) to convert nominal prices to current prices.

Mortgage lending has also been resurgent with an average of 95,341 monthly mortgage approvals for
house purchases in the seven months up to and including February 2021, the strongest level since 2007. More
recent indicators suggest this momentum has continued, with the number of UK residential purchases in March
2021 being 102.3% higher than March 2020 and 32.2% higher than February 2021. Rightmove announced that it
had recorded its busiest ever day on April 7, 2021, with 9.3 million visits to its website, and attributed this strength
to growing optimism in the UK’s economic outlook (in light of the positive vaccine roll-out), the return of low
deposit mortgages and the benefit of the stamp duty holiday extension to the end of September 2021. The extension
will see no tax levied on the first £500,000 of property purchases until June 20, 2021, with this nil-rate band
reducing to £250,000 until September 30, 2021, after which it will revert to £125,000.

The provision of affordable housing remains a priority for the Government, with a pledge to invest
approximately £12 billion in the construction of affordable homes (as defined by the NPPF as housing for sale or
rent for those whose needs are not met by the market) in England between 2021 and 2026 – the largest investment
into affordable housing in over a decade. The 2021-2026 program is expected to support the construction of
180,000 homes over five years from 2021 to 2026 and is expected to unlock an additional £38 billion of
public/private investment in affordable housing.

**Housing Demand and Supply Dynamics**

We believe the following key factors drive the demand for housing in the UK:

**_Macroeconomic Environment_**

Historically, the strength of the UK housing market and of the housebuilding sector has been linked to
that of the UK economy as a whole, which in turn is influenced by both European and global macro-economic
conditions. Demand for housing is driven by a combination of factors, such as the rate of economic growth (both
nationally and regionally), the rate of population growth and the increasing number of first-time buyers, the
average age and life expectancy of the population, the rate of household formation, the availability and
affordability of mortgages, consumer confidence (discussed further below) and the unemployment rate. In
addition, the outlook in prices remain strong across different region, representing an increasing opportunity for
Keepmoat.

The following graph illustrates projected estimates of ASP growth across regions from 2021 to 2025:

Source: Savills Residential Property Forecast, March 2021

Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, global GDP is estimated to have fallen 3.5%, with UK
GDP declining 9.9%. While current data remains volatile due to the phasing of Government restrictions (UK GDP
rose 1.2% in December 2020, fell 2.2% in January 2021, and rose 0.4% in February 2021), the UK economy
appears to be recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to a successful vaccine roll-out. Recent
forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimate GDP growth at 4.0% in 2021 and envisage
that the economy will return to its pre-pandemic levels by Q2 2022. Elsewhere, the labor market continues to be
distorted by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (“CJRS”) (with an estimated 4.7 million workers furloughed
at the end of February 2021 versus 8.9 million in May 2020), with the ONS estimating the employment rate at
75.1% in February 2021 (1.4% down year-on-year) and the unemployment rate at 4.9% (0.9% higher year-onyear). Despite this, the OBR estimates that the unemployment rate will peak at 6.5% in Q4 2021 as furlough winds
down and improve thereafter. Notably, for the period from January 2021 to March 2021, London had the highest
level of unemployment at 6.8%, compared to 5.4% in the North East, 5.0% in the North West, 5.7% and 4.9% for
the West and East Midland regions respectively, and a low of 3.4% in the South-East.

The following graph sets forth the estimated growth in UK GDP and estimated unemployment rate
through 2025:

There have also been early signs of recovery in wage growth since the end of lockdown. In contrast to
past periods of economic stress, the housing market has seen renewed momentum since May 2020, with many
commentators attributing this to the release of pent-up demand and changing household preferences instigated by
the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Consumer Confidence_**

Consumer confidence is an economic indicator that measures the degree of optimism that consumers
have regarding the overall state of the economy and their own financial situations, and provides an indication of
future developments of households’ consumption and savings. Generally, when consumer confidence is high, this
will have a positive effect on demand for housing. The Bank of England is predicting increased consumer
confidence with the easing of restrictions on economic activity and households expected to spend around 10% of
their additional accumulated savings over the next three years. The GFK Consumer Confidence Index rose to a
13-month high in April 2021, its highest level since the start of the pandemic. Consumer confidence was -8 in
August 2021 (-7 in July 2021), which compares to a lockdown low of -34 in April 2020.

**_Mortgage Availability_**

Demand for housing is also affected by the ability of prospective buyers to secure financing to buy a
home, which is in turn affected by banks’ and other lenders’ willingness and ability to provide mortgages to
prospective buyers. UK Finance, a trade association for the UK banking and financial services sector, estimates
that UK gross mortgage lending to £233 billion in 2020, representing a 13% decline from the prior year, and
forecasts that it will fall to £215 billion in 2021 before recovering to £230 billion by 2022. However, recent
mortgage approval data points to a stronger situation, with approvals in the seven months up to and including
February 2021 averaging 95,053. This is 41% ahead of the comparative period a year earlier, which was
undisturbed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank of England’s Q2 2021 Credit Conditions Survey showed that
lenders expected the availability of credit to improve further in the three months ended August 31, 2021, as well
as expecting demand to improve and for mortgage spreads to narrow further.

**_Mortgage Affordability_**

Demand for homes is affected not only by the availability of mortgages, but by the affordability of the
mortgage products that are available, relative to earnings. Nationwide estimates that first-time buyers spent an
average of 31.7% of mean take-home pay on mortgage payments in Q4 2020. This compares to the average since
1984 of 33.1%, a low of 17.5% in 1996 and a high of 56% in 1989, as demonstrated by the following graph
showing UK mortgage rates between 1995 and 2021:

__________________

(1) Monthly interest rate of UK monetary financial institutions (excluding Central Bank) sterling 75% LTV fixed rate mortgage to

households, not seasonally adjusted.

This demonstrates that while first-time buyer house price-to-earnings multiples are close to an all-time
high (5.3x for Q1 2021), mortgage rates are low in a historic context, reflecting low base rates. The following
charts show mortgage payments as a proportion of first-time buyers’ take home pay from 1984 to 2020, Mortgage

**Rent vs. Mortgage payments for FTB in England**

**(£ in thousands)**

Notably, the key geographical drivers behind the rise in the UK house price-to-earnings ratio through
recent quarters have been London and the surrounding areas, with an average multiple of 12.7x since 2015
(compared to 5.2x for the North East, and 5.7x for the North West). The more Northern regions typically display
better affordability ratios, given their lower house prices. The average UK mortgage rate secured in February 2021
was 1.92% (compared to 1.82% in February 2020), which while up from a low of 1.73% in August 2020, compares
to 3.85% in May 2011 (the highest point since the start of 2011).

**_Land Supply_**

Demand for housing is also affected by overall land supply levels. Housebuilders have reported a seismic
shift in the UK land market since the introduction of the NPPF in 2012 (subsequently revised in 2018), which put
forward a notion in favor of sustainable development built upon economic, social, and environmental objectives.
This has resulted in planning approvals for residential development in England rising toward 400,000 per annum,
which compares to just over 200,000 completions across the entirety of the United Kingdom in 2019 and an
average of 164,301 per annum in the five years up to and including 2012. This shift in the supply/demand dynamic
has led to much more moderate land prices. Whilst UK house prices are approximately 30% higher than their pre2008 peak, UK greenfield and urban land values are only back to 90% and 80% respectively of their peak 2007
values. This more moderate profile in the land market can also be seen from the disclosed land input costs of the
quoted housebuilders.

**Government Support for Housebuilding**

The introduction of the NPPF in 2012 and Help to Buy in 2013, the 2015 Spending Review and Autumn
Statement and the subsequent Housing and Planning Bill in November 2015 all stand as key milestones in a recent
historical context to evidence growing governmental support for the housebuilding sector. The December 2019


-----

Conservative Party majority win (the largest governmental majority since 2005) reinforced this, and the
Conservative Party reiterated its support for the sector in its 2021 annual budget.

**_New Housing_**

With new housing highlighted as a fundamental party value, the Conservative Party reiterated its pledge
to increase the number of new homes built per annum, with the goal of delivering at least one million additional
homes through this parliamentary cycle. A target of delivering 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s provides
scope for significant upside from current levels of approximately 200,000, with optimism reinforced by a proposed
£10 billion Single Housing Infrastructure Fund (a capital grant program to fund the provision of strategic
infrastructure, such as roads, schools and healthcare facilities, needed to support new homes) to help deliver on
targets.

**_Mortgage Guarantee Scheme_**

The Government announced in April 19, 2021 a new mortgage guarantee scheme which will increase the
availability of 95% loan-to-value mortgage products, enabling more households to access mortgages without the
need for prohibitively large deposits. Further, in an attempt to increase the ability of young people to take the first
step onto the housing ladder, the Government will seek to encourage a new market in long-term fixed rate
mortgages with slashed deposit values, improving entry-potential for first-time buyers across the UK.

**_Right to Buy_**

The voluntary Right to Buy scheme with housing associations is expected to continue, with the scheme
granting eligible housing association tenants the opportunity to purchase their homes at Right to Buy level
discounts. This comes following the successful pilot voluntary scheme adopted by five housing associations
(L&Q, Riverside, Saffron, Sovereign, and Thames Valley Housing) in 2016, and the subsequently launched
Midlands pilot scheme in August 2018. The latter saw 44 housing associations take part and a total of 1,892 home
sales or homes in the final stage of the sales process by 30 April 2020. All large housing associations (over 1,000
dwellings) in the Midlands took part, with four guiding principles acting as the basis for the scheme:

      - Right to Buy level discounts for eligible housing association tenants: eligible housing
association tenants have the right to the same level of discounts, funded by the Government, as
local authority tenants have under the statutory Right to Buy scheme.

      - Board control over which homes to sell: housing associations have the final decision over
whether or not to sell a property with the Government compensating the housing association
should the discount be applied to an alternative housing association property purchased by the
same tenant.

      - Full compensation: housing associations to receive the full market value of the property sold,
with the discount value funded by the Government.

      - Flexible one for one replacement through new supply nationally: for every home sold, a new
affordable property would be built in England to increase overall supply.

In February 2021, a full evaluation of the scheme was published by the Government, with a subsequent
indication they were committed to the evaluation of new pilot areas, with further details to be provided in due
course.

**_Right to Acquire_**

The Right to Acquire scheme is similar to the Right to Buy scheme, but is available to eligible housing
association tenants across England with homes built or acquired after April 1, 1997 who have had a public sector
landlord for at least three years. It provides a smaller level of discount compared to the Right to Buy scheme.

**_Help to Buy_**

An extension of the Help to Buy scheme from 2021 to 2023 has been confirmed, providing buyers with
deposits of at least 5% an interest free equity loan of up to 20% (London 40%) to help support the purchase of a
new build home. The scheme additionally incorporates regional maximum property price caps, ranging from


-----

£186,100 in the North East to £600,000 in London, denoting the maximum value of a home to which the scheme
applies. From April 1, 2021 onwards, the scheme is restricted to first-time buyers.

**_Help to Buy Shared Ownership_**

This scheme enables anyone in England with household income of less than £80,000 outside London and
£90,000 inside London to buy a home through shared ownership. Under the new model of this scheme, buyers
acquire a stake between 10% (previously 25%, but to be reduced to 10% from 2022) and 75% of the home’s value
and pay rent on the remaining share. This scheme is also expected to run until 2023.

**_Stamp Duty Holiday_**

The impact of the Coronavirus pandemic put the housebuilding sector largely on hold between March
and May 2020, with this followed by a period of reduced activity given the stop-start nature of the easing of
lockdown restrictions. In an attempt to both kick-start the housebuilding sector and reinvigorate the wider
economy, on July 8, 2020 the Chancellor announced a temporary increase in the amount a purchaser could pay
for residential property before Stamp Duty Land Tax (“SDLT”) would apply, from £125,000 to £500,000, for the
period July 8, 2020 to March 31, 2021. This holiday was extended until June 30, 2021, from which point the
threshold reduced to £250,000 until September 30, 2021, after which it will revert to £125,000.

**_Community Housing_**

The Right to Buy and Right to Acquire schemes will seek to assist tenants in local communities who
wish to establish ownership of their council/housing association homes. Additionally, the Government has also
announced £2.1 million in funding to help communities have a greater say in how their local area is developed.
The fund will boost neighborhood planning by giving additional support to local authorities in under-represented
areas.

**_Help to Build_**

The Government announced new plans in April 2021, supported by over £150 million in new funding,
to lower the required deposit for mortgages in order to make it easier and more affordable for people to build their
own homes. The Government estimate the Help to Build scheme could deliver 30,000 to 40,000 new homes per
year, with an equity loan provided with a low-level deposit similar to that of the Help to Buy scheme.

**_Affordable Homes Programme_**

The Affordable Homes Programme was set up in 2010 to provide grant funding to support the capital
costs of developing affordable housing for rent or sale. The first iteration of the program from 2011 to 2015 aimed
to fund the creation of 150,000 affordable homes through a combination of new builds and the conversion of
existing housing assets. A subsequent program was introduced for 2016 to 2021, in which the Government made
£4.7 billion of capital grants available to deliver starts on site for at least 135,000 homes for Help to Buy: Shared
Ownership; 10,000 homes for Rent to Buy; and 8,000 homes for supported and older people’s rental
accommodation. The provision of affordable housing was reaffirmed as a priority for the Government in the 2021
budget, with a pledge to invest £11.5 billion in the construction of affordable homes in England between 2021
and 2026, providing up to 180,000 new homes across the country. Approximately £7.5 billion of funding will be
provided to deliver up to 130,000 homes outside of London, and a further £4 billion to deliver homes in London.

**_First Homes_**

In June 2021, the UK Government launched a new initiative called “First Homes,” which offers firsttime buyers a minimum discount of 30% on the purchase of a new home through developer contributions. The
same percentage discount must then be passed on with the sale of the property to future buyers (who must also be
first-time buyers), meaning that homes will always be sold at a discount to market value in perpetuity, with the
aim of benefitting local communities, local workers and key workers and families. After the discount has been
applied, the first sale must be at a price no higher than £250,000 (or £420,000 in Greater London). Changes
proposed to the planning system to support this initiative may require that First Homes properties should account
for at least 25% of all affordable housing units secured through developer contributions. The Group partnered


-----

with Homes England and Bolsover District Council on the first phase of an early delivery project of First Homes
in the Bolsover district, East Midlands.

**_Environmentally Friendly Homes_**

Global support for green considerations and carbon reduction continues to grow, with the Government
echoing this in looking to support the creation of new homes with advanced energy saving capabilities in its
proposed changes to the building regulations governing the specification of the homes the sector builds. A vision
for ‘Homes of the future’ was laid out within the Conservative Party pledges, with an intended incorporation of
innovative design and technology noted as methods to address environmental considerations. The proposed Part
L and Future Homes standard in the building regulations will reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of running a
home, but will be more expensive to build.

A primary focus remains to further prioritize brownfield site developments and protect the Green belt
through enhanced biodiversity and improvements to poor land quality. The proposed 10% ‘Bio Diversity Net
Gain’ element of the Environment Bill could inadvertently increase the cost of developing brownfield land due to
it becoming dense, self-seeded vegetation over the decades it has been left vacant. This land is regarded as having
a higher bio diversity value, than greenfield land and therefore achieving the proposed net gain is potentially more
costly.

The following table illustrates a summary of UK government initiatives, and the subsequent chart shows
the number of new constructions approved for the periods indicated:

**Facilitating approval of new construction**

**Housebuilder and Lender Collaboration**

In recognition of the need for low deposit, high loan to value mortgages to support aspiring house buyers
become homeowners, the housebuilding sector and lenders are exploring new low-deposit mortgage products,
including a product backed by a mortgage indemnity scheme developed by the Home Builders Federation and
other market participants that will offer 95% loan to value mortgages for new homes. Upon completion of home
purchases offered as part of the scheme, the developer pays a percentage of the purchase price into an insurance
policy, which reduces risk for the lender. This scheme is currently being piloted in the North East of the UK but
is expected to be rolled out more widely across the UK should the trial prove to be successful.

**Regulatory Environment**

One of the key regulatory regimes that UK housebuilders must adhere to are those that concern planning
permissions for residential developments. In England and Wales, the majority of spatial planning is regulated by
the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. All developments, except for those which are permitted pursuant to
permitted development rights, require planning consent by the relevant local planning authority.

Planning consent is obtained through the preparation and submission of a planning application, which in
some circumstances may include an environmental statement prepared as part of the Environmental Impact
Assessment process. The planning application is considered by the local planning authority following consultation
with relevant stakeholders, having regard to national and local planning policies, environmental impacts and other
material considerations.

There are two types of planning consent that can be obtained. The first, known as outline planning
consent, is typically sought for the development of greenfield sites or larger sites requiring development in phases.
An application for outline planning permission allows for a decision on the general principles of how a site can
be developed. Outline planning permission is granted subject to conditions requiring the subsequent approval of
one or more “reserved matters.” Reserved matters are those aspects of the development which an application can
choose not to submit details of with an outline planning permission. These include aspects such as appearances
and layout. The second, known as full planning consent, grants detailed consent for the development.

Planning consents are granted subject to various conditions which must be complied with at certain points
throughout the delivery of a development. Some planning conditions require certain information to be provided
to and approved by the local planning authority prior to certain works being undertaken. In addition, all planning
permissions are granted subject to the development commencing within a certain period of time, failure of which
results in the lapsing of the planning consent.

In the case of most developments, local planning authorities require that housebuilders enter into Section
106 agreements prior to the grant of planning consent in order to make such developments acceptable in planning


-----

terms. These agreements govern a developer’s commitments to build affordable housing and infrastructure, in
addition to providing other community benefits. Obligations under these agreements could include financial
contributions towards local infrastructure (including schools, roads and healthcare facilities) that are needed as a
result of increased demand brought about by the development. Additional obligations could include affordable
housing contributions, which may take place either through an on-site requirement for the housebuilder to build
an agreed amount of affordable housing or payment of a commuted sum. The level of affordable housing
contributions is often set within local authority planning policy but can be renegotiated on specific grounds.
Section 106 agreements must be entered into by the owner of the land for which the related planning permission
relates. As the obligations contained within such agreements run with the land and (subject to any exclusions
agreed with the local planning authority), they are enforceable against subsequent owners of the land.

In England and Wales, housebuilders may also be required to pay a Community Infrastructure Levy
charge typically intended to contribute to the wider infrastructure of an area in which a site is located.

Given the complexity and localized nature of the land planning system, the overall process is usually
considered risky, time consuming and expensive. Following a consultation process launched in August 2020
which was aimed at reforming the planning system, the Government is expected to bring a new planning bill
before the UK Parliament in Autumn 2021. Some of the key areas under consideration are:

      - consulting local communities from the beginning of the planning process;

      - harnessing the latest technology through online maps and data in order to ensure the planning
system is more accessible;

      - ensuring local plans are developed and agreed in 30 months – down from the current average of
seven years – so that homes may be built more quickly;

      - overhauling the current planning process with a clearer, rules-based system. Under the current
system, approximately one third of planning cases that go to appeal are overturned at appeal;
and

      - replacing the existing systems for funding affordable housing and infrastructure with a new,
more predictable, and more transparent levy.

In July 2021, the Government introduced its long anticipated Building Safety Bill (which is applicable
in England, although some of the changes will also apply to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland). The Building
Safety Bill has not yet made its way through the UK Parliament, and it is anticipated that this will take at least
nine months from the introduction of the bill and possibly longer. Thereafter, the changes will come into force
incrementally. The Building Safety Bill has been introduced to strengthen the regulatory system for building
safety, change industry culture to foster a greater emphasis on safety and accountability, implement rigorous safety
standards for construction products, and provide a clearer path to redress for homeowners. The main elements of
the Building Safety Bill include:

      - overhauling the regulatory landscape for the design and construction of high risk residential
buildings that are 18 meters or have at least seven stories and two residential units and their
subsequent occupation, management and operation;

      - establishing a building safety regulator and updating existing building safety regulations;

      - establishing a new framework to provide national oversight of construction products and
strengthening the powers of the Office for Product Safety and Standards in this area;

      - establishing a new homes ombudsman and simplifying the process to log complaints to the
Housing Ombudsman Service for social housing tenants;

      - making financial provisions to support the removal of unsafe cladding, including through a levy
on developers seeking permission to develop certain high rise buildings in England; and

      - strengthening the enforcement action that can be taken in the event of breach including in
relation to criminal offences for non-compliance.


-----

Impact assessments undertaken by the Government indicate that the reforms will cost the industry more
than £1 billion in their first three years. This is not inclusive of the levy referred to above, nor is it inclusive of the
proposed new tax for the UK residential property development sector (which also serves to meet cladding
remediation costs). The proposed new tax will apply to residential developers’ profits over £25 million and the
Government anticipates raising at least £2 billion over a decade. The Government is currently in consultations to
determine the structure of the tax scheme ahead of its inclusion in Finance Bill 2021-22.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are one of the UK’s oldest and most experienced partnership housebuilders, with “5-Star
Homebuilder” status awarded in 2021. We are focused on creating sustainable communities in places where
people want to live, and we specialize in the delivery of affordable and high quality homes, principally targeted
at first-time buyers. Headquartered in Doncaster, England, we operate across England and Scotland through nine
operating regions. We are a top ten UK housebuilder, measured by the number of homes sold, including delivering
4,035 homes in our financial year ended October 31, 2019.

Unlike traditional housebuilders, our business model is based on partnerships with entities interested in
seeing an increase in supply of homes as well as those with demand for our product. These partners are primarily
land owners (such as Homes England, Local Authorities and private land owners) or Registered Providers, which
include the traditional not-for-profit and the newer for-profit entities that are registered with the Regulator of
Social Housing to provide affordable housing. We engage each of our key stakeholders in residential projects by
establishing, aligning and prioritizing their needs and successfully delivering their objectives. We have built our
reputation by aligning our approach to our partners’ objectives regarding the sourcing, procurement, planning and
delivery of successful, affordable housing developments that create significant social value. We believe that we
are the original partnership-focused housebuilder in the United Kingdom, having worked with over 200 partners
to date, with many of these relationships enduring for over 20 years.

Our partnership model allows us to have a high degree of certainty over our land pipeline, with sufficient
land secured for six years of development based on our future development plans and on 2019 home deliveries,
while also typically allowing us to defer payment until milestones are met. We are also able to minimize
development and planning risks by partnering with land owners through the early stages of a development project.
Coupled with the relatively low land costs for the affordable homes that we target, we are able to operate a capitallight business model relative to traditional housebuilders, and generate relatively strong cash conversion and
ROCE. In the financial year ended October 31, 2019, the last full financial year prior to the start of the COVID19 pandemic, our ROCE was 32.8%.

We focus on developing urban and suburban locations where there is an inherent demand and supply
imbalance for new homes. We aim to meet this demand through our five core standard house type ranges. This
standardization allows efficiency in procuring materials and construction, increased certainty of cost and timing
of delivery, and assists in establishing optimal site layout mix based on demand and our partners’ preferences. We
are continually working with new technologies that underpin and refine our designs.

We are committed to deliver a range of affordable housing, predominantly for open market sale, social
housing and shared ownership – which provides us with a higher degree of market resilience over the long term
due to generally consistent demand from first-time buyers and well-funded Registered Providers. In the financial
year ended October 31, 2020, approximately 74% of our sales were on the open market (which includes sales to
private customers as well as elective sales to Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a
site), with the remaining approximately 26% of our sales comprising sales to Registered Providers that are
contracted at the outset of development of a site, including but not limited to those contracted to satisfy Section
106 obligations. Approximately 87% of our open market sales in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 were
to private sale customers, of which approximately 76% were to first-time buyers (first-time buyers accounted for
76% during the financial year ended October 31, 2019). In the financial year ended October 31, 2020,
approximately 45% of our total sales, including 67% of sales to first time buyers, involved the use of the
Government HTB scheme. We believe that first-time buyers provide more resilient structural demand than the
typically discretionary and cyclical home-mover segment.

development of a site, including but not limited to those contracted to satisfy Section 106 obligations. Open market sales include
private sales, elective sales to Registered Providers agreed during the development of a site, Affordable Homes Programme sales
and private rental sector sales. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Description of Statement of Comprehensive Income—Revenue.”_

(5) Private sales customer mix based on statistics from a survey of 1,053 private sales customers in the financial year ended October

Sustainability is also a key driver of our operations, with a particular focus on community-building and
place making. In July 2020, following stakeholder consultation, we published our Sustainability Strategy in which
we identified our material issues and aligned our strategy to eight SDGs. Through our Sustainability Strategy, we
have committed to minimizing our impact on the environment and biodiversity. In particular, we have announced
that we intend to achieve a net zero carbon position by the mid-2040s (having formally committed to Race to
Zero) and that we intend to publicly disclose our carbon performance from 2022 onwards.

We were active on 94 sites as of July 31, 2021. In addition, as of July 31, 2021, the number of plots
within our land pipeline was 24,654, with approximately 81% of our land pipeline, or 19,933 plots, being legally
secured (meaning that we have a contractual right to develop or a conditionally exchanged contract). As of July
31, 2021, approximately 19% of our land pipeline, or 4,721 plots, were those on which we had been appointed
preferred developer (meaning that we had been chosen by the land vendor as the final candidate to progress to
contract for the development of the site). Together, these plots are equivalent to a six-year supply of homes, based
on our pre-pandemic annual completion levels.

As of July 31, 2021, we had a forward order book of approximately £503 million (representing 3,151
plots) with an open market sales rate of 0.77 for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021. As of September 19,
2021, we had reserved, exchanged or legally completed almost all of our planned sales for the financial year
ending October 31, 2021. Furthermore, as of September 19, 2021, we had secured approximately 40% of our
planned sales for the year ended October 31, 2022, 85% of our planned sales for the three months ended January
31, 2022, and 45% of our planned sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022. As of September 19, 2021, we
had an eight-week rolling average rate of 0.93, demonstrating continued strong demand from our customers.

Our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 were £628.5 million and
£73.8 million, respectively. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data.” Over the same
period, we generated Free Cash Flow of £44.1 million (and free cash flow conversion of 59.8%). The resilience
of our business model was demonstrated through the COVID-19 pandemic. Working with our partners, we were
able to agree a deferral of 89% of committed and uncommitted land spend, without losing any site investment
opportunities as a result. We believe our financial results in recent quarters demonstrate the resiliency and strength
of our business model.


-----

Our focus on partnerships provides us with an attractive financial model, benefitting from typically lower
land values, attractive (and often deferred) payment terms, the potential for additional elective deals with
Registered Providers (beyond sales in connection with Section 106 affordable housing obligations) and access to
grant funding to optimize returns. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data.”

**Our Strengths**

**_Strong Fundamentals Underpinning the UK Housing Sector, Supported by a Favorable Government Policy_**
**_Environment_**

The supply of housing in the UK market has lagged behind demand and the regions where we operate in
particular are characterized by a structural supply-demand imbalance. The UK Government’s position has
historically been that everyone should have the opportunity to own an affordable, decent home within a sustainable
and mixed community. To this end, support for the housing market and first-time buyers has been a target of
government policy over recent years, starting with the introduction of the NPPF in 2012.

In its 2021 annual budget, the Government reiterated its pledge to increase the number of new homes
built per annum, with the goal of delivering at least one million additional homes through this parliamentary cycle.
Overall, the Government has a target to build 300,000 homes per year through the mid-2020s (as announced in
the Budget 2017), and we expect there to be continued support for the housebuilding sector as the Government
seeks to achieve this target.

The following chart shows the number of homes completed by private sector and public sector funding,
as compared to the Government target of 300,000 per year.

In particular, the first-time buyer market outside of London, our core target market, is aided by a
supportive structural and political backdrop promoting both home ownership and affordable housing, including
through UK central Government funds, loans, grants and subsidies, which assist in both the viability of schemes
and also pace of delivery. As demonstrated by the recently launched “First Homes” program, which offers firsttime buyers a minimum 30% discount on the purchase of a new build home, we expect this segment to continue
to be a key focus area for the UK government in the future. This has contributed to a rise in housebuilding
completions to 178,310 in England in the year ended December 31, 2019, the highest level since 2007. This is,
however, far below the 300,000 per year needed in England as estimated by the UK Government in early 2021
despite the macro-economic uncertainty created by the pandemic. As household formation continues to rise and
the pandemic has reinforced buyer preferences for houses over flats, we have experienced a strong recovery in
2021 to date.


-----

The demand backdrop for housing remains supportive with the continued increase in UK household
formation. The following chart shows the number of homes in the UK since 2011, as of June 29, 2020, with 20212039 data estimates completed by private sector and public sector funding, as compared to the Government target
of 300,000 per year.

(6) Office for national statistics

While it is not currently known whether the HTB scheme will be extended after 2023, what modifications
to any extensions may be, or if other government support for the sector may be put in place, we believe the
Government will remain focused on supporting those purchasers who form our key customer base. For instance,
when the HTB scheme was modified and extended to March 2023, reforms were implemented to restrict the
scheme to support only first-time buyers from April 1, 2021 onwards and with regional price caps from £186,100
in the North East to £600,000 in London. As our ASP was £162,000 in the year ended October 31, 2019, we
believe this modification will have little to no adverse impact for our business. Our ASP compares favorably for
entry price point customers when compared to our listed peers.

Further, based on our ability to navigate recent changes to the Scottish equivalent of the HTB scheme,
we do not believe that any termination of the HTB scheme would have a material effect on the demand for our
homes in England. In Scotland, the “Affordable New Build Scheme” remains available to larger housebuilders
(including Keepmoat), though it stopped accepting new applications on February 5, 2021. The suspension of new
applications has had no major impact on our performance in the region, which we believe is primarily a result of
our target market dynamics, competitive entry price point and strong reputation as a 5-Star Homebuilder.

**_We Operate in those areas of the UK Housing Market with the Highest Levels of Affordability and Resilience_**

We believe that we are strategically positioned in the most attractive segment of the UK housing market,
from both a demographic and a geographic perspective. Key attractions of this market segment include resilience
in adverse macroeconomic environments, the greatest affordability levels in terms of income/price ratios and one
of the strongest growth rates in historical and forecast volumes. This segment is also conducive to strong
partnerships with land owners such as Homes England and other local authorities, as well as delivery partners,
including Registered Providers, in their role as agents for the implementation of Government housing policies
driven by social objectives.

As a result, we have achieved consistently strong sales rates in recent years, outperforming more broadly
focused housebuilders. From April 2017 to July 2021, Keepmoat has achieved an average open market sales rate
per outlet per week of 0.82, which is above the broader housing sector’s average open market sales rate per outlet
per week of 0.66.

purchase type, age, employment type, occupation.

ended October 31, 2020. Figures do not always add to 100% due to rounding.

First-time private buyers are a segment that has historically been resilient as purchases are more
frequently driven by a “need to buy” rather than the typically discretionary and cyclical home-mover segment.
Most first-time buyers also see a financial benefit to purchasing as compared to renting, with average mortgage
payments in the UK approximately 18% lower than the cost of renting a private two-bedroom home (based on
2020 average payments). In addition to personal life cycle reasons, this provides a financial incentive to purchase
even in economic downturns. First-time buyers accounted for 76% of our sales to private customers in the financial
year ended October 31, 2020, while only 50% and 51% of all home purchase loans obtained in the UK in 2020
and 2019, respectively, were for first-time buyers. Further enhancing resiliency, our customers represent a wide
range of occupations, reducing exposure to potential slowdowns in any individual occupational sector.

The following charts illustrate rent and mortgage payments for first-time buyers in England and mortgage
payments as a percentage of mean take home income per region.

In terms of geographical footprint, we strategically focus on regions with fundamental affordability
underpinned by strong customer demand and high growth rates. Each of these regions is characterized by belowaverage house prices and mortgage payments as a percentage of take home pay for first-time buyers. The average
income to mortgage payment ratio for the regions we operate in is in excess of 4.0x, compared to approximately
2.0x to 2.5x for London and the South East or approximately 3.3x for the UK as a whole. Additionally, in each
region, our ASP is below the regional average, leaving room for price inflation while remaining at the affordable
end of the spectrum.

The following chart compares our ASP with the market average in the respective regions shown below.

Market Sales ASP for the financial year ended October 31, 2020 based on regional sales data. Keepmoat “South” region has been
compared to the UKHPI “South East” region as the most applicable comparator based on locations served.

We have a well-established presence in North England and are expanding our footprint in the Midlands
and Scotland, where these regions are expected to have higher home completion volumes than the UK average in
the medium term. Forecasted growth rates for ASP between 2021 to 2025 are 28.0%. in the North West, 28.0%
in Yorkshire and the Humber, 23.9% in the East Midlands and 23.9% in the West Midlands, compared to an
already strong UK average of 21.5%.

**_Our Partnership Model Carries Inherently Less Risk than the Traditional Housebuilding Model, with High_**
**_Barriers to Entry and Partners that are Structurally Aligned_**

We are one of the UK’s leading dedicated partnership-focused housebuilders with a proven track-record
and a strong reputation of delivering large scale, multi-faceted, residential-led regeneration schemes throughout
England and Scotland. Unlike traditional housebuilders, we primarily develop in collaboration with partners that
have some form of long-term continuing interest (either through ownership or social responsibility) in the relevant
development. We are a partner of land owners such as Homes England and other Local Authorities, as well as
delivery partners, including Registered Providers of affordable housing, strategically catering to structural demand
driven by social objectives and Government housing policies.

Partnership relationships promote effective and capital light land sourcing and site development (often
with deferred payment terms correlated to the pace of site development and unit sales), as well as the ability to
unlock development sites often inaccessible to traditional housebuilders. Unlike the traditional model, the
partnership model offers an attractive financial profile with lower land acquisition costs, favorable (often deferred)
payment terms, cash generative and competitively priced deals with Registered Providers, access to grant funding
and accelerated delivery, enabling us to pursue investments with an attractive ROCE.


-----

The following chart provides an illustration of the lifecycle of a development and key differences in our
model.

_______________

(2) Keepmoat profile based on a sample of sites. Traditional profile based on management’s experience of the UK housebuilding
industry.

Over the past 25 years, we have developed strong relationships with many of the largest land partners in
the UK, which are predominantly public land owners but also include private land owners, and have built a strong
reputation for delivery, quality and place making (i.e., creating thriving, sustainable communities where people
genuinely want to live, work and play). Relationships are maintained at multiple organizational levels, which help
identify future projects and facilitate successful tender processes. This results in a high volume of repeat business
and a strong visibility of the order book. Long-standing partner relationships such as ours are inherently difficult
to replicate for new entrants.

We believe that the partnership model also has a reduced risk profile, as it is fundamentally based on a
structural alignment of objectives among ourselves and our partners, which results in pragmatism and flexibility
when required. As demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, working with our partners, we were able to
agree a deferral of 80% of committed land spend and 97% of forecast uncommitted land spend, without losing
any site investment opportunities as a result.

**_Operating Model with Best-In-Class Processes and Cost Structure_**

We have specialized in offering a standardized product range of family homes as the optimal means of
building affordable and high quality housing units, while minimizing execution risk and improving predictability
of costs as well as improving construction build times. This focus on product standardization is a key
differentiating element of our business model and commercial proposition to our partners, contributing to the
creation of a strong brand.

To facilitate standardization, we typically utilize our five standard house type ranges, catering to the
requirements of private sale, sale to Registered Providers and local authorities, future mobility standards and
Scottish building standards (where applicable), which assist in establishing optimal site layout mix based on
demand and partner’s preferences. Although it varies from year to year, in the financial year ended October 31,
2020, 88% of our homes were built using standardized housing types.

The in-house development process of our portfolio of core standard designs is based on internal feedback
for saleability, buildability, customer feedback and land/commercial optimization, and is a key driver of the
continued operational improvements across the Group that have resulted in enhanced operating margins.


-----

Standardization of house types has enabled us to accurately reflect third party designs (such as heating,
roofs, furniture and kitchens) for space and accessibility standards. These standard details allow us to promote
best practices for quality, safety and precise material scheduling, optimizing waste as a result. Importantly,
standard specifications facilitate forward demand planning, purchase leverage and rebate maximization. It allows
contractors to bid aggressively on our projects as they have greater confidence around deliverability on cost and
on time. The standardization process has also enhanced the quality of our products which, in turn, has increased
customer satisfaction and reduced aftercare costs.

The efficiencies across the supply chain and cost control and optimization have strengthened our ability
to maintain strong margins and provide a partial defense from cost inflation pressures. This is further enhanced
by our disciplined approach through all stages of capital allocation, acquisitions and cost control. Standardization
has also enabled us to continue to maintain a low ASP, providing the potential to benefit from sale price increases
during inflationary periods.

**_Proven Ability to Source Land through a Disciplined Acquisition Process_**

We have implemented a structured and agile land acquisition process, enabling a continued
replenishment of our land pipeline that has contributed to sustained margin improvement over the last few years.
As there is a lag between the securing of land and the ultimate delivery of finished product on that land, we may
see benefit from this focus on land acquisition being realized over time.

We have a controlled and disciplined internal land acquisition approval process, working within defined
control gateways each requiring senior executive and/or Capex Committee approval. Our land approval protocol
involves three stages. The Pre-Bid Capex proposal establishes the nature, suitability and targeted financial returns
(for gross margin and ROCE) of the opportunity. The Capex 1 Proposal includes a review of planning, title and
legal reports, site risks/mitigants and required approvals, with continued focus on delivering in line with the
threshold financial returns. Finally, the Capex 2 proposal is the region’s final proposal to develop the site
(including financial plan) once all legal matters and major approvals are received. We believe this rigorous land
sourcing process, together with sales price optimization, build and sales management and the resulting increasing
mix of higher quality and better procured sites, may all be contributing factors driving continued margin
expansion.

For example, for sites under development that were approved between 2017 and 2019 (excluding the
North West MCI region), average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for each year of approval
range from approximately 22% to 23% by year, whereas for sites either approved since 2020 or within our secured
pipeline and to be approved, average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for each year of
approval or for the “to be approved” category, range from approximately 24% to 25% by year or category. This
is an increase from the average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins for sites under development
that were approved in 2016 and pre-2016, for which average forecasted full-site-life Gross Development Margins
are approximately 21% and 18%, respectively.

**_Strong Management Team with Proven Operational Experience_**

We have a strong management team with a proven track record in UK housebuilding, including expertise
in land acquisition, construction, planning, development and partnering with housing associations, local
authorities, and Registered Providers. This has been instrumental in helping us to achieve 5-Star Homebuilder
status in 2021 with a 92.6% customer satisfaction score.

Since the formation of our executive management team in 2018, we have delivered consistent year-onyear revenue growth, Gross Development Margin and EBIT growth (excluding the COVID-impacted financial
year ended October 31, 2020). The team has accomplished this primarily through an increase in scale, improved
operational efficiency and a disciplined land acquisition process spearheaded by the divisional management team
which has extensive knowledge of the selected regions in which we operate.

**_Strong Financial Track Record of Growth and Returns_**

We have a strong track record of growth and increase in profitability in recent years, resulting from the
combination of our geographical expansion process and strong focus on operational improvements and margin
expansion. From the financial year ended March 31, 2015 to the financial year ended October 31, 2019, revenue
grew by a CAGR of 22% and home completions grew from 2,133 to 4,035 (representing a CAGR of 15%), driven


-----

by methodical expansion in established regions and into new regions, including in January 2017 the acquisition
of MCI Developments Limited in the North West, as well as benefiting from ASP increases.

The KM Group’s Adjusted EBIT increased 47.7% from £41.4 million for the financial year ended March
31, 2018 to £61.1 million in the financial year ended October 31, 2019. Inevitably, the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic had a negative impact in the KM Group’s financial performance in 2020. However, illustrating the
strength and resiliency of our business model, we generated revenues of £628.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of
£73.8 million in the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 3.3% and an increase of 18.3%,
respectively, as compared to the financial year ended October 31, 2019.

Concurrently with this growth, we have made significant investments in structure and personnel at both
regional and head office levels, creating a national platform optimally crafted to support our future growth in our
target geographies. Margins have remained stable over this period, proving our ability and further potential to
continue investing and increasing scale.

**Our Strategies**

Our strategy is to maintain and strengthen our position as one of the leading partnerships-focused
housebuilders in the UK, while delivering enhanced margins and returns from our maturing regional platform. To
achieve this goal, we are focused on the following key strategic priorities.

**_High Visibility on Medium Term Revenue Growth, Risk Mitigation Opportunities and Margin Improvement_**

Our current land pipeline reflects a strong level of land security to deliver on the business plan and
continue to drive future growth, providing us with excellent forward visibility. As of July 31, 2021, there were
24,654 plots in our land pipeline, of which approximately 81% were legally secured, meaning that we have a
contractual right to develop or a conditionally exchanged contract. This equates to a land pipeline of six years at
pre-pandemic annual volumes. We intend to continue to leverage our strong land pipeline and high near-term land
visibility to increase delivery volumes.

We currently characterize five of our nine regions (the East Midlands, South Midlands, North West MCI,
Scotland and West Midlands regions) as “growth regions,” and we believe these regions have significant potential
to deliver additional plots within the existing regional management structure as they mature. We will target both
continued growth in volume and margin improvement, as the business delivers on regional management team
investments that have been made in these growth regions and benefits from the continued realization of land
acquired through improved sourcing processes.

Approximately 86% of our land pipeline has agreed deferred land payment terms with our partners. Of
our land pipeline plots that have been legally secured as of July 31, 2021, approximately 37% represents projects
that were not legally completed and there remained conditionality (e.g., planning and groundworks survey) prior
to finalizing the contract. There are further risk mitigation opportunities available to us within our partnership
model such as land payments made by Registered Provider partners, overage agreements, pace and tenure delivery
flexibility and multi-tenure development.

The benefits of these risk mitigation features have been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic,
with our strong relationships with partners providing flexibility to recalibrate land and delivery obligations during
this challenging period. Altogether, we were able to either defer or pay in alignment with plot delivery £58.4
million of £65.5 million total forecast land payments (89%) from April 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020.

**_Continued Development of Our Large and Strong Land Pipeline_**

In addition to building out our strong land pipeline of over 24,000 plots, we intend to continue to pursue
new land opportunities to maintain the secured land pipeline, particularly increasing the amount of higher quality,
better procured sites (reflecting our enhanced requirements and processes prior to approval for an opportunity
being granted). We expect to continue to have a structured, disciplined and agile approach to land acquisitions to
facilitate securing suitable land opportunities across all of our regions, who each have dedicated land acquisition
teams focused on high quality land opportunities within each region’s geographical area of operation.

**_Strengthen Relationships with Key Stakeholders_**

We intend to build on our long-standing relationships with key stakeholders such as Registered Providers,
Local Authorities, and Government agencies, such as Homes England. These relationships have been nurtured


-----

over two decades and are held throughout our organizational structure and that of our partners, from executives
to regional management and staff.

We have a proven track record for delivery, quality and placemaking resulting in winning repeat business.
Going forward, we will continue to align objectives with key partners in areas such as climate and biodiversity
emergency targets, in addition to the growing need for affordable homes. We will also seek to develop new
relationships through our new business teams.

**_Continue to Focus on Delivering Best Services while Maintaining Strong ESG Benefits and H&S Standards_**
**_at our Sites_**

Customer satisfaction is at the heart of our business and we strive to deliver high-quality homes and
customer service, reflected by our 5-star customer status. We intend to continue to focus on ensuring that our
customers are supported throughout their house buying journey, meeting their expectations, and providing them
with a high-quality new home.

Sustainability is core to the partnership business model and we are committed to prioritizing ESG
initiatives. Key stakeholders are aligned in their focus with approximately 74% of Local Authorities in the UK
declaring a climate and biodiversity change emergency, with regeneration areas often more vulnerable to climate
and environmental impacts. We are working with Wildscapes, which is a wildlife trust consultancy, to develop
methodologies to support the delivery of a net gain in biodiversity for future developments. We are responsible
for placemaking and regeneration which in turn helps create direct and indirect employment opportunities within
low-income communities. We are focused on providing affordable, low carbon homes to contribute to delivering
on our and our partners’ objectives of improving the environmental sustainability of the UK’s homes.

We have committed to a number of near term ESG targets, including: introducing science-based carbon
targets aligned to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius along with carbon performance metrics (currently
anticipated to be set in late 2021); setting our decarbonisation roadmap within 12 months from July 2021, with
the aim of achieving a net zero carbon position by the mid-2040s; mitigating supply chain risks and supporting
our supply chain to become more sustainable; and updating our sustainability structure, providing greater
oversight and focus on sustainability with the function reporting directly to the CEO and receiving greater focus
from the Board.

Additionally, we have well-developed and structured H&S policies, certified to ISO 45001:2018, and
training programs, as reflected in our health and safety track record. We have clear policies, best practice guides
and robust standards and operate a number of forward looking and backward looking metrics.

We continuously seek to improve our H&S performance and approach, focusing on risk throughout all
phases of a development. Our strategic objectives are centered around (i) keeping people safe and healthy every
day; (ii) protecting and enhancing the environment; and (iii) being assured and informed. Each of the these
strategic objectives contain a number of initiatives focused on achieving the objectives and cover, amongst other
matters, active and visible leadership; managing risk effectively and proportionately; accountability, behavior and
culture; capability; contemporary management systems; and key performance indicators. As initiatives are
implemented, they are reviewed for effectiveness by our executive EHS committee and monitored.

**Our History**

Our origins as a partnership focused homebuilder date back to 1931, when we were founded as Bromell
& Ogden to work with local authorities in South Yorkshire to build and maintain essential amenities. Since then,
we have grown organically and through acquisitions.

During the 2008 financial crisis, we came under the ownership of the Lloyds Banking Group, which was
then our financial lender. The Lloyds Banking Group exited in 2014, with TDR Capital LLP (“TDR”) and Sun
Capital Partners (“Sun”) acquiring controlling interests. Under TDR’s and Sun’s control, we introduced a new
management team focused on growing our business, expanding from four regions in 2014 to nine regions as of
the date of this Offering Memorandum.

Our organic growth was enhanced in January 2017 by the acquisition of MCI a developer of social
housing projects for local authorities and other Registered Providers, which strengthened our capacity, particularly
in the North West of England. Following the acquisition of MCI, we further streamlined our operations, selling
our regeneration business to ENGIE for £330 million. With our renewed focus on homebuilding, and the


-----

completion of a successful internal restructuring exercise to streamline our regional operations, we obtained 5star Homebuilder status in 2021.

**Business Operations**

We are one of the UK’s largest partnership-focused housebuilders, working with over 200 partners to
date including Homes England, Local Authorities and Registered Providers, as well as private partners, with
strong expertise in regeneration projects to develop affordably priced housing and positive social outcomes.
Approximately 79% of the plots in our land pipeline as of July 31, 2021 were being developed under the
partnership model. The remainder of our homes are planned to be developed under speculative land deals whereby
we purchase land to then develop sites on our own.

We have a presence across much of the UK (excluding the greater London area, Wales, southern home
counties and directly west and north west of London) and were one of the top-ten UK housebuilders from 2018
to 2020 (measured by the number of homes sold), delivering a total of 3,988 homes in the twelve months ended
October 31, 2018, 4,035 homes in the financial year ended October 31, 2019, 2,460 homes in the financial year
ended October 31, 2020 (reflecting the impact of COVID-19 during the second half of the financial year ended
October 31, 2020) and 3,652 homes in the twelve months ended July 31, 2021. We focus on building homes with
standardized designs, which in turn contributes to design and building efficiencies and quality control. Our designs
are also relatively straightforward to build and sell, as they do not involve high rise buildings, complex
construction methods or cladding. Our homes typically have two to four bedrooms, with 25% of our plots as of
October 31, 2020 consisting of two bedroom homes, 59% consisting of three bedroom homes and 13% consisting
of four bedroom homes. Of those private homes which achieved legal completion in the financial year ended
October 31, 2020, approximately 57% were semi-detached houses, 15% were detached houses, 11% were end of
terrace houses, 10% were mid-terrace houses and 7% were apartments.

The following chart illustrates our housing portfolio and the ASP for each type of home for the financial
year ended October 31, 2020 based on private legal completions in that period:

Our homes are primarily aimed at first-time buyers and social landlords, with an average selling price of
£161,000 for the financial year ended October 31, 2019, £165,000 for the financial year ended October 31, 2020
and £174,000 for the nine months ended July 31, 2021. Our customers are primarily private purchasers and
Registered Providers. Open-market sales (including elective sales to Registered Providers agreed during the
development of the sites) represented 75% of the total plots that we sold in the financial year ended October 31,
2020 (with an average selling price of £175,000 over the same period). The remaining 25% were sold to Registered
Providers as part of the Section 106 affordable housing obligations in connection with the planning consent for
the sites, or otherwise agreed with Registered Providers at the outset of development. Registered Providers are the
main providers of new homes in the UK social housing sector and are part-funded by the Government.

We have a proven track record of revitalizing communities through the delivery of high-quality homes
in well-designed and well-connected neighborhoods and at prices that customers can afford. Over the past 25
years we have successfully delivered new homes in some of UK’s most challenging housing markets,
demonstrating our commitment to delivery even in the most demanding market conditions. In the financial year
ended October 31, 2020, 71% of our legal completions were situated in areas falling within the most deprived
30% of the UK, based on the Indices of Multiple Deprivation.


-----

Brownfield sites represented 73% of our legal completions in the financial year ended October 31, 2020.
Brownfield land is typically characterized by high population density, proven demand and a shortage of housing
supply, and is often equipped with infrastructure (public transport, schools and shops). Local authorities have
increasingly focused on the regeneration of brownfield land, which is where we have a significant portion of our
developments.

**_Operational Structure_**

We operate exclusively in the UK, with nine regional teams organized into two divisions: (a) the North
Division, comprising Scotland, North West, North West MCI, North East and West Yorkshire; and (b) the South
Division, comprising East Yorkshire, East Midlands, West Midlands and South Midlands. A Divisional Chairman
is responsible for each of the two divisions, supported by a Divisional Finance Director in each division.

Our current operational structure was adopted in 2020, following an internal reorganization aimed at
optimizing our regional office locations versus our target geographies. We believe that our current divisional
structure provides an appropriate span of control for the divisional management team, allowing the right level of
oversight for each region to ensure that performance is carefully monitored while maintaining alignment of our
overall strategy and growth plans.

The following map shows the regions in which we operate and the locations of our regional offices as of
the date of this Offering Memorandum, as well as the blended ASP of each region for the nine months ended July
31, 2021. We also have a satellite office located in Bristol, which is part of the West Midlands region.

Each of the regions has its own management board, which typically includes a regional managing director
who supervises a team of regional directors, each of whom has their own area of expertise, such as commercial,
construction, customer care, finance, land and partnership, sales and technical. The regions are empowered to
deliver the Group’s overarching operational excellence strategy, applying the Group’s policies and systems to


-----

local markets and circumstances. The regions have a high degree of autonomy, with clear reporting channels to
central management and the ability to share central infrastructure support functions. We believe that this structure
and approach means that we are well positioned for future growth in the right locations. However, we intend that
our regions and their boundaries will remain flexible in the future to allow for growth and expansion into new
areas where there is a compelling commercial rationale, and to enable all offices to remain at an optimum size for
effective management.

**_Our Partnership Model_**

Our partnership model is central to our approach to development and sets us apart from our competitors.
Our partnership model presents the following benefits:

      - reduced competition for large scale land opportunities;

      - resilient demand for affordable homes;

      - capital light approach delivering strong ROCE; and

      - repeat business through track record and reputation.

Unlike traditional housebuilders, we primarily develop in collaboration with partners that have some
form of long-term continuing interest (either through ownership or social responsibility) in the relevant
development, which are primarily land owners (such as Homes England, Local Authorities and private land
owners) and Registered Providers of social housing. We assist our partners in achieving their key goals of
regenerating sites that achieve positive social outcomes through the provision of high-quality, affordable housing.
Our focus on this segment of the market provides us with significant expertise in the management of regeneration
projects, which is a key differentiator between us and most traditional housebuilders. We believe that this model
facilitates efficient, effective and capital light land sourcing and site development, while also enhancing returns
and mitigating market and development risks.

The following chart provides a comparison of certain key differences between our partnership model and
the traditional housebuilding method:

_______________

(1) Traditional housebuilders includes Barratt Developments plc, Bellway plc, The Berkeley Group Holdings plc, Crest Nicholson
Holdings plc, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc, Taylor Wimpey plc, Vistry Group plc.

(4) Targets are provided for illustrative purposes only. This illustration does not purport to reflect the current returns on any particular
site or for the Group as a whole or the potential returns that could be achieved on any particular site or the Group as a whole. These
are medium term targets only and not a profit forecast. There can be no assurance that these targets can or will be met and it should
not be seen as an indication of the Group’s expected or actual results or returns.

Some of our partner agreements facilitate the drawdown of land under phased viability assessments.
These forms of agreements accounted for approximately 19% of our land pipeline as of July 31, 2021, and see
large development opportunities broken down into phases, with the land for each phase being appraised and valued
at the time that we are ready to develop it. Payment terms are also agreed and drawn down once we are ready to
develop that phase, and are therefore based on the prevailing market conditions at the time. This allows us to
assess the performance of a prior phase before we commit and agree to payment terms and a land valuation for
the following phase. The characteristics of phased viability schemes help to reduce the working capital
requirements of each project, limit our market and planning risk (including exposure to unexpected land cost
depreciation) and allow us to mitigate any exposure to challenging partner specifications or cost inflation related
to construction and materials. For our other partner agreements, land is purchased from our partners as a single
site, with the land value and payment terms (often deferred) agreed at the completion of the deal. We complement
this approach with a build timescale that matches our sales patterns.

Below is an illustrative comparison of the cash profile of our partnership model through the life of a site,
compared with that of traditional housebuilding companies:

As of July 31, 2021, our land pipeline comprised 24,654 plots equating to six years of land supply at prepandemic volumes. The composition of the land pipeline is as follows:

      - 19% is that which we categorize as “preferred developer” status, where we have been chosen
by the land vendor as the final candidate to progress to contract for the development of the site.

      - 30% is secured with a conditional contract, often subject to planning approval and ground
condition resolution. Consolidating these first two categories, 49% of the pipeline is made up
of sites on which we have some conditionality prior to finalizing the contract.

      - The residual 51% is land on which we have legally completed the purchase or securing of the
site.

Our legally secured plots have certain features which mitigate certain risks associated with developing
the plots. These features include (i) deferred payment terms, which are often correlated to the pace of delivery;
(ii) land payments that are made by Registered Provider partners; (iii) low base land costs through negotiation and
the inclusion of an overage share; (iv) pace and tenure delivery flexibility, which is particularly significant during
periods of market slowdown; and (v) opportunities for multi-tenure delivery.


-----

_Land Creditor Commitments_

Our partnership model seeks to enhance returns and mitigate risk by reducing upfront investment in the
land through deferred payment terms, payments on a per-plot basis, payments triggered by cumulative plot sales
or similar development milestones (that may or may not include specified backstop dates) and deferred land
tranche payments. As of July 31, 2021, 86% of our land pipeline was purchased with land payments to be made
on deferred terms.

We believe that our land creditor profile provides us with an element of risk mitigation, as the majority
of our payments are linked to development delivery milestones rather than needing to be made up front. Our land
creditor commitments are unwound as the relevant payments for these deferred land costs fall due and are made
from period to period. The following chart shows the amount of land creditor commitments as of July 31, 2021,
that we expect to unwind during each of the periods indicated:

In addition, some of our arrangements with development partners include overage mechanisms, whereby
we may make additional payments to our development partner following completion of the land sale contingent
upon exceeding agreed financial thresholds, with payments often deferred to the end of the development of the
site or of a significant phase of the site.

Together, these deferred payment obligations and overage obligations comprise our land creditor
commitments. We believe that our land creditor profile, which is inherent to our partnership model, provides us
with an element of risk mitigation as the majority of our payments are linked to development delivery milestones
rather than needing to be made up front. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations and Commercial_
_Commitments.”_

The following table shows the breakdown of our land creditor commitments, by contract terms, as of
July 31, 2021:

#### Total
 Contract Terms (in millions of £)
 Fixed Date Liabilities .........................................................................  41.7 Overage (Determined)........................................................................  8.6 Sub Total ............................................................................................  50.3
 Milestone Payments – with Backstop ................................................  70.7 Milestone Payments – without Backstop ...........................................  28.4 Overage (Not yet determined) ............................................................  60.1 Other ..................................................................................................  8.4 Sub Total ............................................................................................  167.6 Total .................................................................................................. 217.9

As of July 31, 2021, the majority of our land creditor commitments were to Homes England (43%) and


-----

Local Authorities (34%), with the remainder to other partners (13%) and private vendors (11%). The following
table illustrates our land creditor breakdown by partner type:

**_Our Partners_**

We leverage our long-term partner relationships to both access target sites and proactively identify
delivery partners for development opportunities. As of July 31, 2021, 79% of the plots in our land pipeline were
being developed under the partnership model. Our partners include public and private sector land owners as well
as Registered Providers. In particular, we benefit from strong, long-standing relationships with public bodies
(including Homes England, Local Authorities and charitable organizations, and Registered Providers) and private
land owners. These relationships have been built using our successful track-record of delivering projects, our
reputation for aligning our approach with our partners’ objectives, our established national scale and our deep
understanding of the motivations beyond financial returns that are important to our partners (including social
value, sustainability, accelerated delivery and design quality). We have established a track record of doing repeat
business with a growing number of partners.

Our partners select housebuilders that can help them deliver their housing, economic, social and
environmental goals. Choosing a developer who can (a) repurpose brownfield land into well-designed schemes of
affordable, high-quality homes, (b) regenerate neglected, derelict areas into thriving mixed tenure communities
that are socially and economically inclusive, and (c) deliver this in a way that enhances the public realm and
biodiversity and reduces carbon outputs which is at the forefront of partners’ objectives.

In order to successfully operate our partnership model, it is imperative that we understand our partners’
goals and maintain and promote strong relationships and a strong reputation for delivery. Our reputation and
understanding of these features contributes to our strong forward pipeline of projects and our competitive
advantage. We believe that this understanding, alongside our extensive experience with the public procurement
process and proven regeneration expertise, provides us with a significant competitive advantage. Furthermore,
our partnership oriented focus allows us to remain closely aligned with Government housing policy and our close
work with various levels of government allows us to participate in a wide range of pilot projects and government
consultation initiatives. Working with these partners provides us with the potential to access grant funding and
investment support (particularly from Homes England and Local Authority partners) to facilitate the development
of land that would otherwise be unviable to develop. As a result of the structured and lengthened timelines that
we operate under while working with our partners, we are able to carry out extensive due diligence and thorough
evaluations of the technical and economic feasibility of a project development before committing to a land value,
which in turn serves as an important risk mitigation tool. Conversely, in traditional development and in speculative
transactions, the due diligence and evaluation of a site is often undertaken in a compressed timeframe so that the
site can be acquired before the vendor has the opportunity to sell the site to another prospective purchaser.

Registered Providers are experts in delivering multi-tenure housing, which may include social rent,
affordable rent, market rent and shared ownership homes in a single development. We believe that a multi-tenure
housing offer is essential in order to regenerate and deliver truly sustainable communities and this acts as a driving
factor as to why we work with delivery partners including Registered Providers. In addition, creating multi-tenure
communities allows us to diversify our revenue streams among various demographics and through shared
ownership, outright sale and private rented homes.


-----

Our largest delivery partner is Homes England, the non-departmental public body that provides funding
and land to the housing sector to deliver the Government’s housing policies. Similarly, we are one of the largest
strategic delivery partners of Homes England. Our relationship with Homes England (and its predecessors)
extends over two decades and across all of its operating regions. Our relationship with Homes England has
included support in matters related to the sourcing of land, infrastructure funding, the accessing of grants to assist
in developing otherwise unviable sites, funding affordable housing programs and participation in the Help to Buy
scheme. We have also participated in piloting new Government initiatives and providing input on policy
consultations.

We are a member of Homes England’s current DPP (“DPP3”), which was set up to facilitate public
sector bodies bringing public land to the market. We have been a member of all of Homes England’s DPPs to date
and are one of the most active developers on DPP3. Having been a member of each of the DPPs, we have extensive
knowledge and understanding of the bid process, assessment criteria and delivery requirements, which in turn
provides us with a significant competitive advantage when bidding on sites offered by Homes England. As of July
31, 2021, we had secured approximately 9,223 homes, across 38 sites through the successive DPPs.

In June 2021 we applied to be part of Homes England’s new “dynamic purchasing system” and received
confirmation in early September 2021 that our application had been successful. This system was designed to
modernize the bidding process through the use of a digital platform, simplifying the process for housebuilders to
join the list of preferred developers and bid for land, and is due to be used for land procurement from Autumn
2021 onwards.

We are also a registered investment partner of Homes England, which gives us the ability to apply for
affordable housing grants alongside Registered Providers. Homes England also provides development finance,
long-term infrastructure funding and grant funding to both the housing sector and Local Authority partners to
facilitate housing outputs. Since 2009, we have directly and indirectly benefitted from approximately £450 million
of funding initiatives from Homes England to facilitate the delivery of new development sites and homes.

The following table illustrates the key details of our top ten partners as of July 31, 2021:

**Top Ten Land Owner Partners in Land Pipeline**

**Total ..........................................................................** **10,126** **n/a** **9,116** **41%**


With the exception of Homes England, each of the land owner partners in the above table is a Local
Authority.

**_Working with Registered Providers_**

Our work with Registered Providers can be divided into three distinct categories:

      - _Registered Provider sales required through Section 106 obligations (categorized as Registered_
_Provider sales): Local planning policies often specify the proportion of homes on new_
residential developments that must be provided as social housing through a Registered Provider.
This obligation is often a condition to planning consent for a particular site, and is set out in
each case through a Section 106 agreement. Social housing that must be delivered through a
Section 106 agreement is ineligible for Affordable Homes Programme funding and, as a result,
Registered Providers generally purchases these homes at a significant discount to their open
market value. This discount is factored into our land appraisal at the outset of the development.
Registered providers typically pay for these homes incrementally as the site is developed.


-----

      - _Registered Provider sales, in addition to Section 106 obligations, agreed at the outset of_
_development of a site (categorized as Registered Provider sales): These sales represent_
agreements (agreed at the outset of development) to sell all or a proportion of the homes on a
site to a Registered Provider as part of our strategy for purchasing and developing a site, in
addition to any Section 106 obligations. As these sales are in addition to any social housing
obligations under Section 106 agreements, they are eligible for Affordable Housing Programme
funding, which helps generate attractive commercial offers from the Registered Provider.
Registered providers typically pay for these homes incrementally as the site is developed.

      - _Elective Registered Provider sales agreed during the development of a site (categorized as open_
_market sales): These are sales agreed with Registered Providers after the development of a site_
has already commenced. Had each such sale not been made, we would otherwise have sold the
home to a private buyer as part of our overall open market selling activity for the site. The
decision to agree this form of sale is based on the specific economics of each potential
Registered Provider elective sale, as benchmarked against other open market sale opportunities.
These sales are particularly useful in periods where the residential housing market has slowed,
or where a site is less attractive on the open market than otherwise predicted. As these elective
sales are in addition to any Section 106 obligations, the Registered Provider is able to access
Affordable Homes Programme funding, which helps generate attractive commercial offers.
Registered Providers typically pay for these units through a deposit with the balance paid upon
completion.

Our work with Registered Providers provides us with a number of benefits, including:

      - a capital efficient work stream, as Registered Providers often pay incrementally and in advance
of their homes being built (often with a significant upfront deposit), which thereby strengthens
each project’s ROCE;

      - the multi-tenure housing (including shared ownership homes) that we offer to Registered
Providers serves as a natural complement to our private sales;

      - Registered Providers are well funded by the Government and have delivery commitments to
fulfil in a defined period of time; and

      - in addition to our developments with Registered Providers pursuant to Section 106 obligations
or pursuant to build agreements at the outset of a site development, we have found that
Registered Providers’ strong appetite for homes generally provide us with an opportunity to
make additional elective sales during the period of development, on commercial terms that are
in line with a home’s full open market value.

The benefits of our partnership model and our work with Registered Provides have been demonstrated
during the COVID-19 pandemic, with our strong relationships with partners providing flexibility to recalibrate
land and delivery obligations during this challenging period. Altogether, we were able to either defer or pay in
alignment with plot delivery £58.4 million of £65.5 million total forecast land payments (89%) from April 1, 2020
to August 31, 2020. The following chart further describes our ability to defer or pay in alignment with plot delivery
during the COVID-19 pandemic:

**_Selected Ongoing Partnership Developments_**

Some of our current projects being undertaken through our partnership model include:

      - _Charlestown, Salford:_ Charlestown is a brownfield development project that we have
undertaken together with Salford City Council. The development, which was launched in
October 2016, is a 15 hectare development of 425 homes, located in a deprived community in
Salford. The development will include two hectares of green space, amounting to 13% of the
total area of the development. 85 homes at the site, equating to 20% of the total homes
developed, will be affordable homes. The project is expected to complete in June 2024.
Environmental benefits at the site include the creation of a Sand Martin nesting colony on the
riverbank and 99% of waste being diverted from the landfill. The sites environmental benefits
have received notable recognition, having been shortlisted for the BIG Biodiversity Award for
NEET (not in education, employment or training) horticultural project.

      - _Primrose Lodge, Goscote: Primrose Lodge is a brownfield development project that we have_
undertaken together with Walsall Housing Group (selected through its DPP). The development,
which was launched in November 2019, is a 11.9 hectare development of 407 homes, located
in a deprived community in Goscote, Walsall, on the site of a former interwar housing estate.
126 homes at the site, equating to 31% of the site’s total homes, will be affordable homes. The
project is expected to complete in May 2026. Environmental benefits at the site include: (i) no
net loss of biodiversity through native species planning in woodlands and public open spaces;
(ii) sustainable drainage ponds providing amphibian habitats and local species nesting boxes
and habitation; (iii) the inclusion of an electric vehicle charging point in all homes; (iv)
sustainable drainage designed for a one in one hundred year flood plus 40% climate change
adaptation; and (v) 99% of waste being diverted from the landfill. Social benefits include a
commitment to providing work placements, school support, construction college support and
apprenticeships, with 44 jobs having already been created to date.

      - _Waterside, Leicester: Waterside is a brownfield development project that we have undertaken_
together with Leicester City Council, and which represents our first major scheme in the city.
The development, which was launched in November 2019, is a 6.95 hectare development of
288 homes, located in a deprived community near Leicester city center on a site formerly
occupied by an industrial estate and cement batching plant. The site will include a 79 bedroom
extra care facility. The project is expected to complete in April 2026. Environmental benefits at
the site include: (i) a low carbon homes specification that generates 5% lower emissions when
compared to building regulations; (ii) a design to achieve zero net loss of biodiversity; (iii)
sustainable drainage to prevent localized flooding in a high flood risk area; and (iv) 99% of
waste being diverted from the landfill. Social benefits include (i) the creation of 88 work
placements to date along with nineteen full-time jobs that will continue to exist after
development has completed; (ii) a commitment to create three apprenticeships; and (iii) the
creation of a “World of Work” program that will be delivered to construction students at
Leicester College.

      - _Seacroft Hospital, Leeds: Seacroft Hospital is a brownfield development project that we have_
undertaken together with Homes England. The development, which was launched in December
2016, is an 18.7 hectare development of 503 homes, located in a deprived community near
Leeds (a community which is ranked in the bottom twentieth percentile in the UK index of
multiple deprivation), on a former hospital site. The site will include 15% affordable homes,
with 15% built to lifetime homes standards. The project is expected to be complete in October
2022. Environmental benefits at the site include: (i) a low carbon homes specification that has
20% lower emissions and 10% lower energy requirements when compared to building
regulations; (ii) 2.7 hectares of public open space, with ecologically sensitive features including
species habitats and 277 trees; (iii) the inclusion of an electric vehicle charging point in all
homes with off-road parking; and (iv) 98% of waste being diverted from the landfill. Social
benefits include the development of active travel routes linking to the Bradford Leeds Cycle
Superhighway and links to the Primrose Valley park. The project was a finalist for the
Housebuilder Awards 2020 – Best Community Initiative and Best Training or Recruitment
Initiative.

**_Joint Ventures_**

Although joint ventures are not one of our key areas of focus, in certain cases our partners require that
we set up joint ventures to facilitate delivery of specific schemes. These requirements are most common when
working with Local Authorities on large-scale projects that involve multi-year, multi-phase development and land
draw-downs. These joint venture opportunities generally allow us to obtain exclusivity on land within certain
areas, limiting competition and boosting land security over an extended period of time.

We currently have three active joint ventures:

      - _Durham Villages Regeneration Limited (“Durham Regeneration”): Durham Regeneration is a_
50/50 joint venture that we entered into with Durham Council in 2003. It is our longest standing
joint venture. The original purpose of Durham Regeneration was to regenerate the former coal
mining villages and towns around Durham City. Durham Regeneration now operates across the
county. Discussions are ongoing with Durham County Council regarding potential future sites.

      - _Sheffield Housing Company (“Sheffield Housing”): Sheffield Housing was incorporated in_
2011 and is 50% owned by Sheffield City Council, 45% owned by us and 5% owned by Great
Places, a Registered Provider. We typically provide the build and sales capability to Sheffield
Housing under a contract for a set return, which serves as a low-risk source of revenue. We are
also then eligible for dividends as a shareholder of Sheffield Housing, thereby also benefitting
from any upside potential in the developments.

      - _New Tyne West Development Company LLP (“New Tyne”): New Tyne was incorporated in_
2011 and is 50% owned by Newcastle City Council and 50% owned by BK Scotswood LLP.
BK Scotswood LLP is in turn a joint venture subsidiary that was originally 50% owned by us,
and 50% owned by Barratt Developments, which is a company engaged in residential property
development. In December 2020, we acquired Barratt Developments’ 50% interest in BK
Scotswood LLP. The area of the development is expected to create one very large neighborhood,
covering approximately 65 hectares. In addition to being an indirect joint-venture partner, we
are also a delivery contractor for New Tyne.

**_Land Pipeline_**

As of July 31, 2021, the number of plots within our land pipeline was 24,654, with approximately 81%
of our land pipeline, or 19,933 plots, being legally secured (meaning that we have a contractual right to develop
or a conditionally exchanged contract). As of July 31, 2021, approximately 19% of our land pipeline, or 4,721
plots, were those on which we had been appointed preferred developer (meaning that we had been chosen by the
land vendor as the final candidate to progress to contract for the development of the site). Together, these plots
are equivalent to a six-year supply of homes, based on our pre-pandemic annual completion levels. As of August
20, 2021, we had secured 101%, 105%, 104%, 82% and 56% for the financial year ended October 31, 2021 and
the following four subsequent financial years (expressed as a percentage of our planned future completions for
the current year), respectively.

Approximately 79% of the plots in our current land pipeline are being developed on a partnership basis
(including sites that have not yet been secured, but will be developed on a partnership basis if secured).
Furthermore, 86% of our land pipeline as of July 31, 2021 was purchased with land payments to be made on
deferred terms.


-----

The following table sets out the composition of our land pipeline as of July 31, 2021:

**Plots** **(%)**

Preferred developer status ...................................................................................... 4,721 19%
Conditional contract status..................................................................................... 7,346 30%
**Total (not legally completed)...............................................................................** **12,067** **49%**

Homes England ..................................................................................................... 2,970 12%
Local Authority ..................................................................................................... 5,735 23%
Registered Provider ............................................................................................... 902 4%
Other Partner ......................................................................................................... 1,753 7%
Private ................................................................................................................... 1,227 5%
**Total (legally completed) .....................................................................................** **12,587** **51%**
**Total ......................................................................................................................** **24,654** **100%**

The average site size for our secured and preferred bidder partnerships sites is 186 plots as of
July 31, 2021.

The quality of our land pipeline also benefits from our knowledge of, and relationships with, local
markets. These factors allow us to successfully work with local planning authorities, and our planning risk is
significantly mitigated by the fact that we often partner with partners such as Homes England and Local
Authorities, who support us throughout the planning application process.

The overall timetable associated with the planning process generally takes approximately 18 months,
with the planning committee meeting taking place approximately 16 months after a preferred bidder has been
selected. Historically, we have had a significantly higher success rate than traditional housebuilders in obtaining
planning consents. As of July 31, 2021, 79% of our land pipeline had detailed or outlined planning permission.

**_Our Development Process_**

_Sourcing Development Opportunities_

Land sourcing opportunities and strategy are a crucial aspect of our business and receive a significant
amount of attention from our senior management. We source land for our business from both public and private
sector partners. We believe that by understanding bid briefs and being agile and resourceful in delivering on the
land vendors’ requirements, we make ourselves an attractive partner. Our largest source of land (currently
representing approximately 79% of our land) are our partnerships with the public sector, typically Homes England
and Local Authorities, with whom we have formed strong relationships and strategic private partners, with whom
we achieve a high proportion of repeat business. We also source land from the private sector through our regional
contacts with individual land owners and land agents (which currently represent approximately 21% of our land).

With both public and private partners, our participation in a partnership development may be structured
in several ways, each of which is intended to provide a blend of risk and return appropriate to the land being
acquired. Certain arrangements may require us to acquire the land being developed (sometimes in phases). Other
arrangements may grant us with development rights while the original land owner retains ownership of the site
and ultimately transfers completed units directly to the home purchaser. In some instances, we may also enter into
joint ventures with partners to secure exclusive development rights over large scale land holdings, with our longest
running joint venture lasting over 25 years. The timelines from identification of a site to beginning its development
can vary widely from as little as 12 months to two years or longer, and then the development phase can last for a
number of years depending on size and complexity of the project.

Public-sector land is usually brought to market through a competitive tender process, determined by the
“Find a Tender Service” (“FTS”) (previously the Official Journal of the European Union (“OJEU”)) process,
which governs how the public sector disposes of its land assets and procures development services. In the case of
Homes England, disposals are currently effected through the DPP (currently DPP3), of which we are a member.
Historically, being a member of DPP3 has reduced the number of competitors that we have competed with to
secure large scale public land opportunities, providing us with access to development sites typically unavailable
to housebuilders who are not members of DPP3. However, Homes England launched its successor to the DPP,
the DPDPS, on September 1, 2021, which has been designed to modernize the bidding process through the use of
a digital platform which encourages new entrants to the market, and thereby simplifies the process for
housebuilders to join the list of preferred developers and bid for land. We have submitted an application to be a
member of the DPDPS and have received confirmation of our membership on the panel. With this new system,


-----

housebuilders will still have to ‘qualify’ to be able to join the list of preferred developers, but they will be able to
apply to join at any time, rather than only upon renewal of the delivery partner panel once every four years, as is
currently the case.

The public procurement process is a formal, complex and sometimes lengthy process, which, along with
the regeneration aspect of most public-sector land and the pricing dynamics of the affordable housing market,
deters some larger housebuilders from competing for these opportunities. However, our significant experience
with developments of this type and deep knowledge of the financial dynamics and the requirements of these public
sector partners allows us to navigate this process efficiently and effectively.

We often begin preparations for a scheme bid well before we receive formal notification of a project.
Land purchased through the public sector will generally involve multiple phases over an extended timeframe. The
typical process and indicative timeframe is as follows:

**Timeline** **Activity**
Month 0 Release of site for sale / notification of project
Month 2 Submission of an expression of interest
Month 3 Shortlisting by vendor / invitation to tender sent
Month 6 Submission of bid document
Month 8 Formal presentation / bid interviews
Month 10 Clarification sessions
Month 9-12 Appointment of preferred developer partner
Month 17-18 Entry into binding contract
Month 24 Planning consent received
Month 24-28 Finalize land value and legal completion

Vendors in the public sector decide between developer bids according to set, published scheme criteria
and a scoring matrix. The bid assessment criteria often include land value, quality of design, use of modern
methods of construction (“MMC”) and socio-economic elements (including the use of local supply chains and
training and apprenticeship opportunities). A housebuilder’s reputation and track record of delivery will also be a
consideration in awarding large scale regeneration projects. The criteria are usually broken down into specific
categories, with scores and weightings attached to each. Therefore, developers are generally aware of how bids
will be assessed before they are submitted. For example, Homes England typically assesses scheme bids against
two core categories, with 50% of the weighting attributed to the financial offer and 50% attributed to design and
social value. Local authorities often more evenly weigh the financial offer, design and social value. We tailor our
bids in accordance with the bidding criteria that is released for each project, and we believe that we enjoy a
significant advantage against many competing bidders by virtue of our deep understanding of the public
procurement process, combined with our experience and track record of delivering notable regeneration and
development projects aligning with the social goals of public sector partners.

Public bodies generally focus on disposing of brownfield land, which typically has lower land value and
can therefore provide a greater potential upside upon development (depending on regeneration costs). This
contributes to our relatively low average land cost of approximately 11% of sales.

Private sector land is often brought to the market through the owner or a land agent working with the
owner. We also identify site opportunities directly through land searches and planning leads. These provide the
potential for off-market deals where one-on-one negotiation may take place. In both cases, we conduct an initial
assessment to filter out opportunities and compete only for those where we believe we have a high chance of
successfully securing the site. We have strong relationships with a small number of national private sector land
owners with whom we do repeat business, as well as with a number of land agents. The strength of these
relationships, which are based on a mutual track record of delivery and understanding of business drivers, has
been instrumental in our ability to secure large scale, capital light deals with private sector vendors.

In those cases where we are successful in our bid for a project, we are appointed as the preferred
developer and each other party will work towards signing a binding contract while we complete additional due
diligence, as described below.

_Approval Process and Due Diligence_

Once a potential development opportunity has been identified, we follow a clearly defined due diligence
process before we finalize any land purchase. We have a controlled and disciplined internal land acquisition


-----

approval process, working within defined control gateways with extensive senior executive review. Our approval
process can be divided into three stages:

     - _Stage 1 — The “Pre-Bid Capital Expenditure” Proposal: This stage occurs prior to the_
submission of a formal bid or offer for a land parcel, and is intended to establish the financial
suitability of an opportunity. The proposal sets out the nature of the opportunity, including scale
and scope, and considers the opportunity against our targeted returns for gross margin and
ROCE. These target financial returns are then used as benchmarks in stages 2 and 3 of the
process (as described below). Our regional teams, led by the regional managing director,
complete the “Pre-Bid Capital Expenditure” proposal and present it to the Divisional Chairman
for approval. Homes England bids also require approval from the Group Development Director.
There is very limited expenditure incurred at this stage of the majority of bids. Approval of a
Stage 1 proposal allows the region to perform more detailed planning, design, technical and
legal due diligence, as described in Stage 2 below.

     - _Stage 2 — “Capital Expenditure 1” Proposal: This stage is completed before we enter into a_
contract to purchase or develop a site. A region commissions a suite of reports to facilitate the
formulation of a plan to develop the site. The due diligence undertaken by the region to prepare
a “Capital Expenditure 1” proposal includes:

(i) _Land — legal reports and reports on title;_

(ii) _Technical — planning reports, geo-technical (ground) reports, surveys (topographical_
and environments) and design (architectural and engineering working);

(iii) _Sales — market research reports;_

(iv) _Commercial — cost estimates and validation; and_

(v) _Construction — health and safety assessments, environmental assessments and_
programs to facilitate the accurate appraisal of a site.

The focus is on identifying the key constraints (including sustainability constrains), risks and
mitigation plans for the site, embedding them into the site appraisal and ensuring it still delivers
in line with the threshold returns expected for gross margin and ROCE. The costs incurred as
part of this stage include the design work by the architects and engineers, geotechnical work,
surveys, solicitors fees and other consultants fees.

The regional team presents this proposal to our Capex Committee, which comprises our Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Group Production Director and Group Development
Director, and which is supported by our legal team. Our Capex Committee reviews the scheme’s
risk profile against the anticipated returns and cohesion of the regions plan while assessing the
site for approval to proceed to exchange of contract. Approval is also required from the relevant
Divisional Chairman and the Divisional Finance Director. Once Stage 2 approval is obtained,
our legal team authorizes our panel solicitors to exchange contracts to purchase or develop a
site.

      - _Stage 3 — “Capital Expenditure 2” Proposal: This stage is completed before we commence_
construction of the site. It reflects the completion of our pre-development due-diligence process,
presenting the region’s final proposal to deliver the site, including the financial returns the
region is committing to deliver (gross margin and ROCE). It reviews the final position on the
land contract conditions, other legal matters, final details of the deal, technical constraints,
latent risk and mitigation plan, breakdown of the site start budget build cost, a construction plan,
a sales plan confirming values and volume (with updated independent market research) and the
final profit output and cash requirements of the proposal. At this stage, planning consent has
been granted and most, if not all, of the technical approvals have been obtained. Additionally,
we will have already tendered the construction work, providing more cost certainty prior to
commencing the development of the site . The regional team present this proposal to our Capex
Committee for approval, along with approval from the Divisional Chairman and Divisional
Finance Director.


-----

Each region within the Group has land, technical, commercial, construction and sales functions to
undertake (directly or through consultants) all of the pre-development due-diligence when assessing a site for
acquisition. The technical function has overall responsibility for the ground, design, planning, utilities and
environmental investigations. The nature, scale and assessed risk of a scheme and land deal, will determine the
extent of the investigation undertaken, The work undertaken by consultants in high-risk areas, including geotechnical and groundworks areas, is peer-reviewed by other panel consultants to ensure we have identified the
extent of any risk and to ensure that we have robust mitigation plans to protect our financial returns.

Examples of the due diligence work that we undertake during our land acquisition approval process
include:

     - full schedule of technical fees to undertake land due diligence;

     - planning consultation with Local Authorities and planning consultants to establish policy and
requirements;

     - establishing site boundaries and legal ownership;

     - topography of the site;

     - conducting site access checks with the land registry and highways authority;

     - establishing the full requirements to develop the site, including remediation, foundation types,
roads and sewers design and drainage connections and requirements;

     - conducting a full utilities trace which includes gas, water, electrical and communications
equipment using ground penetrating radar; and

     - conducting engineering appraisals such as current drains and site requirements.

The technical planning process is detailed and aimed at avoiding and minimizing risk when construction
teams are on site. Following technical due diligence, the scheme will be packaged, tendered and costed for
submission as described with respect to Stage 3 as described above.

_Agreement of Development Framework and Objectives_

With respect to our partnership developments, after being selected as preferred developer we begin to
negotiate with our partner an agreement laying out the basic framework of our relationship in each development.
Typically, the framework agreement outlines terms applicable for the drawdown of land (sometimes on a phased
basis), funding sources, the development timeframe, development milestones, permissible types of development,
land price, land payment timing and the overage share, where applicable.

We will then refine the objectives of our development with our partners. With Local Authorities, this
usually entails neighborhood transformation through mixed-tenure housing construction and sometimes other
community facilities. We are able to offer our partners a wide range of housing designs to suit their different needs
and can tailor our developments to meet specific goals, such as space standards, tenure, sustainability and
affordability.

_Project Execution_

Land Acquisition and Construction

The ways in which we secure development opportunities may require us to acquire the land being
developed (sometimes in phases), or otherwise we may be granted with development rights while the original land
owner retains ownership of the site and ultimately transfers completed units directly to the home purchaser.

Our developments predominantly utilize the partnership model, although we from time to time acquire
land in speculative deals where we believe that we can achieve attractive financial returns by developing the land
on our own. These private developments may sometimes shift to partnership arrangements during the course of
development, for example, by entering into an agreement with a Registered Provider during the course of
development rather than at the outset.


-----

Our North West MCI region has a different, but complementary operating model to our other regions.
The North West MCI region, which became a part of our business following our acquisition of MCI in 2017,
works exclusively with Registered Providers. The North West MCI region sources land in much the same way as
our other regions, but agrees to deals whereby a Registered Provider buys the site and also pays us to build homes
on the site through build contracts. The Registered Providers pay in advance for the land and progressively for the
construction of the homes, resulting in a model with minimal working capital requirements and substantially
removing the land and sales risk. Our other regions may also enter into similar arrangements with Registered
Providers to deliver all homes on a site to that provider. This typically happens if we have a commercially
attractive offer from the Registered Provider and can generate both a requisite gross margin and an attractive
ROCE, with the Registered Provider funding both the land and build WIP.

Once land is acquired or secured for development, we commence construction, with a focus on realistic
build programs, product and process standardization and a focus on quality at each stage of the build. Standardized
designs allow us to achieve design and building efficiencies while helping to maintain quality control and
simplifying compliance with relevant building requirements. We seek to leverage our scale and procurement
capabilities to deliver homes reliably and manage costs appropriately, utilizing rigorous “cost to complete”
meetings to maintain control on costs throughout the process. Our construction team is responsible for the delivery
of the build process on site to ensure it meets the required safety, quality and program requirements. Sites are
appropriately resourced with experienced management teams to ensure the construction phase runs smoothly at
each site. Infrastructure work is carefully programmed to optimize ROCE.

Quality is a top priority for our business, and all supporting design detailing, workmanship and material
specifications have been developed to embody good practice and simplification. These specifications, created in
collaboration with all departments and subcontractor forums, are used at all stages of our design, procurement and
subcontractor appointment processes. They are embedded in our quality training programs and site inductions and
are also used as build quality checks. We have a formal inspection and sign off process that allows us to benchmark
our build quality, consisting of an internal quality inspection process and external NHBC key stage inspections.
Alongside this, we have produced a series of best practice guides for our site teams to ensure that our homes meet
the required standard and comply with our detailed trade specifications. Customer satisfaction is supported by our
inspection process, which drives our culture of keeping customers as the key focus of our business.

Sustainability is also one of our key focus areas in terms of our approach to construction. Our sustainable
construction practices include the utilization of timber-frame construction (accounting for 12% of homes
completed in each of the financial years ended October 31, 2019 and 2020), the integration of digital and
standardized designs which increase our ability to use offsite manufactured components, improved site efficiency,
control of waste, and a modular homes partnership with ilke Homes. See “—Environment and Sustainability”
below for further detail. Our core house type range is designed using Building Information Modelling (“BIM”).
BIM is used to create house types using digital 3D models which facilitate simpler design, scheduling, cost
estimating, programming, construction, sales visualizations, and sharing with partners and consultants (such as
architects, engineers, community groups and planners). Certain house types designed and built using BIM further
support improved efficiency, waste reduction and collaboration with our third-party designers. Our core house
types accounted for 85% of all homes that we delivered in the financial year ended October 31, 2020.

Additionally, we have been at the forefront in the use of MMC. These methods, which we believe are
particularly well suited for high-volume developments, range from whole homes being constructed with factorybuilt volumetric modules to the use of componentized elements in the construction process. In Scotland, timber
frames are used exclusively, whereas at other of our sites, they are used selectively where required in the bid brief.
Furthermore, we look to integrate off-site manufactured components, such as roof and floor cassettes, which
minimize waste and on-site processes within a traditional build. We have a strong understanding of MMC and
make use of this in testing new technology and exploring and responding to demand for MMC-built homes on our
sites.

Standardization

We focus on building homes from our standard house type range, with over 75% of our homes completed
in the financial year ended October 31, 2020 being standard types. Standardization, and in particular a “Standard
House Type Range” contribute to design and building efficiencies and quality control, as well as simplifying
compliance with relevant building requirements.

We utilize a clearly defined standard house type range that enables our business to benefit from
standardization while facilitating flexibility to adapt both internal levels of specification and external elevations.


-----

We apply standardized elevation and specification detailing in order to adapt to local planning design guides and
regional market expectations. Standardization leads to less risk and greater cost predictability, while different
exterior designs provide us with the flexibility to adapt to the local vernacular.

The following charts shows the percentage of homes built by us that have used standardized designs
during each of the years indicated below:

We utilize a number of core standard design types as set out below:

     - _Open Market Sale Homes: these homes are designed to meet the needs of open market sales_
customers, and are focused on keeping homes affordable while optimizing land use and
profitability. This is the default setting when planning a site, unless partners specify different,
larger space standards.

     - _Design Quality Standards Homes (“DQS”): this is a house type of range aligned to an older_
design code, still preferred by some Registered Providers, which is larger than the “Open Market
Sale Homes” range. These homes are designed for social rent at full occupancy. Homes built in
accordance with these standards adhere to enhanced space standards for circulation, internal
storage and specific minimum furniture layouts.

     - _Nationally Designed Space Standards Homes (“NDSS”): this is a house type range aligned to_
the Nationally Described Space Standards, representing a larger internal space standard, which
is available for adoption by Local Authorities. NDSS homes are subject to local plan viability
testing and approval by the planning inspectorate. These homes are deemed suitable across all
tenures defined by the level of occupancy and were introduced to supersede DQS.

     - _Mobility Standards Homes: this house type range meets a higher level of accessibility and_
incorporates adaptability to address future mobility requirements for occupants. These homes
typically include wider doors, enlarged circulation spaces and ground floor washrooms which
are sized and serviced for future conversion into a ground floor shower room.

     - _Scottish Homes: these homes are developed to meet the Scottish building regulation and space_
standards.

Our use of standardization provides us with a number of benefits, including the following:

     - increased efficiency resulting in reduced pre-development time scales and professional fees;

     - improved cost certainty, construction program certainty and accuracy of land feasibility
analysis;

     - standard details promoting best practices for quality, safety and precise material scheduling,
which in turn reduces waste;

     - standard finishes specification enabling forward demand planning, purchase leveraging and
rebate maximization;

     - improved quality resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction and a reduction in aftercare costs;


-----

     - strong brand creation and the sharing of marketing assets between sites and regions;

     - repeat delivery supporting the efficiencies of our supply chain from tender to completion; and

     - streamlined incorporation of new regulatory standards and considerations into future project
designs.

Our approach to standardization is developed based on internal feedback for saleability and buildability,
customer feedback, commercial viability, and land optimization. Furthermore, trade specifications have been
developed to support the delivery of our homes to promote quality and safety in build and occupation.

Design and Place-Making

We have a proven track record of revitalizing communities through the delivery of high-quality,
affordable homes, in well-designed and well-connected neighborhoods and we believe that our focus on design
quality and place-making helps drive our success in planning applications and sales performance.

We actively contribute to the NHBC Standard Review Group and other industry working groups to help
ensure our design, detailing and specification represent best practices and are aligned to future change.
Fundamental to our design principals is the creation of a sense of inclusion and community through the delivery
of new homes of mixed tenures in attractive, regenerative environments that complement existing local areas and
promote health and well-being. We consider the unique characteristics of each site and its surroundings and seek
to incorporate and enhance existing natural landscape features and habitat to create a sense of place. Design guides
support the use of the house types and elevational styles in delivering the principles of good place making. For
example, strong street scenes, gateway access blocks, urban squares, overlooked public realm and vista stoppers
can all be efficiently achieved using the standard range of houses. Our design model ultimately creates an attractive
living space while maximizing development density.

Pursuant to our partnership model, we engage with Local Authorities and other partners at an early stage
to create design schemes that are acceptable to our local community and help to shape the social and community
infrastructure provided in the area. Early planning and clear design and construction briefs for a regeneration site
are particularly important to set a distinctive sense of place and the tone for the partnership with the local
community. We also engage with communities at early stage regarding regeneration schemes to engender local
support in both a political sense and from the community directly. We believe that our reputation for design and
related collaborative working relationships with regeneration stakeholders are important factors that land owners
and their advisers consider when considering us as a development partner.

We strive to innovate and develop our designs to suit the requirements of all of our customers, including
first-time buyers, families, social housing partners, supported housing providers, and the elderly. Our designs
include enhanced mobility standards, where required, to support the needs of both able-bodied and disabled
people. In certain situations, the design of new homes has been adapted to include special features to support the
customer in their daily routine, for example including a lift, a bathroom with a lifting hoist and wider doors to
allow for a wheelchair user to be able to easily access all areas of the home and garden. While tailoring designs
in order to meet the needs of the customers is a focus of ours, we are also committed to ensuring the homes that
we design are commercially optimized with respect to house type profitability, plot profitability and development
density. The house type range that we’ve established creates a balanced mix of designs to foster generational and
social diversity, support good place making and deliver plotting efficiency.

We recognize the key role that commercial and other non-residential buildings and amenities (including
neighborhood centers, retail space and schools) contribute to creating vibrant communities. Although our core
business does not involve the development of these buildings and amenities, these are typically developed or
delivered by third parties, and many of our brownfield developments are anchored around existing commercial
and non-residential buildings and amenities. We are committed to building stable, sustainable, diverse and
balanced communities, which have at their core an integration of public space, landscaping, biodiversity and
sustainable drainage systems.

Procurement and Supply

We widely employ sub-contractors to build our homes, both for the purposes of efficiency and as part of
our commitment to supporting local communities. Because of the fragmented nature of the market in which subcontracting firms operate, we typically work with local small-and medium-sized enterprises instead of national


-----

companies. Prior to appointing sub-contractors, we pre-qualify them in line with the PAS 91 standardized
questionnaire, through the use of a third party assessment provider. Each sub-contractor is assessed across a range
of areas covering, among other items, health and safety, insurances, environmental, quality management, antibribery and corruption, financial standing, modern slavery and equal opportunities. Sub-contractors submit
tenders based on the house type and design specifications, at which point we then compare the tender quotes
against the appraisal and standard regional costs. Sub-contractors operate under our Keepmoat brand and our
health and safety (“H&S”) team provides them with advice and support and monitors compliance with regulatory
and best practice standards. We work continuously with sub-contractors to ensure a high-quality of product is
delivered at a competitive cost base.

We employ a diversified range of sub-contractors, which limits our exposure to individual sub-contractor
risk and provides more downside protection and flexibility than a direct labor force.

The construction and delivery of homes involves a substantial supply chain. We operate an advanced
centralized procurement process to minimize lead time and construction delay, obtain quota guarantees and
negotiate fair payment terms. Our materials supply-chain strategy is typically underpinned by annual, Group-wide
deals with suppliers with a national, regional or local coverage. This enables us to negotiate better commercial
terms through our consolidated volume and enables the utilization of volume-related rebates. We procure all
material components centrally and have no sole supply agreements on any key materials. Our supply strategy is
delivered through our supply chain director, who is supported by experienced commercial teams employed by us
to manage our material supply chain and sub-contractor relationships. Our subcontractors are responsible for
providing and installing a proportion of the materials required to build a house.

Our suppliers play an essential role in our business, providing the materials and services that we use to
build homes. Our business requires substantial amounts of construction materials, including bricks and blocks, in
addition to construction and equipment and waste disposal services. We believe that maintaining a high-quality
supplier base that is fully aligned to our values is critical to support our growth. Consequently, we seek to maintain
a close partner-based relationship with local supply chains. This approach encourages face-to-face engagement
with our suppliers to maintain core standards and to continuously improve quality, safety, service, innovation and
cost competitiveness.

We operate a series of group-wide, long-term strategic frameworks providing preferential commercial
terms and service levels at a national and regional level to supply the requisite services, materials, site equipment
and business consumables. These frameworks capture both direct purchases of supplies by us and indirect
purchases of supplies, which we specify for use, by our contractors, offering significant pricing advantages, while
also including important delivery, service and product warranties which helps us maintain and improve our quality
and service to our customers. Our “Supply Chain Team” manages over 97 arrangements, which include framework
agreements, commercial arrangements and formal price lists. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 88%
of our direct spend was channeled through these frameworks.

Our supply frameworks align with the Keepmoat Homes Standard Specification and opportunities to
work closely with suppliers to assess new products and technologies to support our drive for standardization (for
example, using roof and floor cassettes to simplify, speed up, make safer aspects of construction, while reducing
the amount of waste). Our supply frameworks also provide customer care and product warranty support to our
customer services teams, with many providing value engineering support, free site surveys and scheduling and
pricing services. Additionally, our supply frameworks reduce business risk and help ensure a secure supply of our
essential materials. We work hard to mitigate price increases and to ensure that our agreements are always
competitive and provide the best quality without compromising on standards. Many of our framework agreements
include rebate agreements.

We maintain regular contact with suppliers and manufacturers to ensure continuity of supply, and
negotiate our product allocations by volume. The availability of materials is secured in line with demand and we
carefully manage the supply of our key products, including bricks and plasterboard, by working with our regional
businesses and our supply chain partners. We engage with our suppliers to keep them informed of key forecasting
information, providing them with a rolling build program on a monthly basis, in addition to product specific
demand schedules. We also notify our supply chain of any changes to our working practices as appropriate.

We have worked closely with our supply chain since the result of Brexit to ensure that we understand
the changes arising from Brexit. We have continued working with relevant members of our supply chain
throughout the ratification of new trade arrangements to understand their challenges and contingency strategies.
Our strategies include careful monitoring of our requirements, clear communication of our requirements to
suppliers, increasing UK stock holding and working with their suppliers to understand the supply of materials to
them. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is difficult to assess whether we have experienced any
significant supply chain issues associated with Brexit, as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been more
pronounced.

**_Marketing and Sales_**

We have regional sales teams that are supported by a centralized marketing team. These teams collaborate
with our partners and local communities throughout a development’s lifecycle, from inception to viability
assessment, planning applications and infrastructure planning and then construction and completion. Our central
marketing team is responsible for branding, corporate literature, digital support and public relations. It also
operates our social media platforms, produces sales and marketing literature, promotes our developments and
works towards strengthening our brand identity. As of July 31, 2020, we had two employees in our central
marketing team.

We utilize a number of typical marketing strategies, including the following:

     - targeted social media advertising aimed at our core market demographics, using Facebook and
Instagram, focusing on key locations identified in our market research;

     - advertising in suitable local and professional publications, aimed at our core market;

     - local advertising on bus routes and using digital platforms at stations near sites;

     - development and house type brochures available in our onsite marketing suites;

     - informative brochures and advertising explaining the “Shared Equity” and Help to Buy
schemes, available in our marketing suite and through online and postal mail shots, as well as
print, online and social media;

     - first-time buyer clinic events;

     - first-time buyer and drop-in sessions arranged with large local employers and held at their
premises and coupled with potential incentives for employees of these organizations; and

     - an “Easymove” facility to help customers with the sales process of their existing home.

Our regional sales teams operate out of our sales outlets, of which we had 56 outlets operating as of July
31, 2021. Regional sales teams are overseen by sales managers, who maintain a detailed understanding of the
local real estate market and trends. Members of our sales teams are generally present at our active sales outlets
and guide buyers through the home buying process. Our sales outlets are typically open five days per week, with
sites in certain high demand areas being open seven days per week. We directly recruit, employ and train our sales


-----

executives to deliver their sales services to our specific target customer demographics. As of July 31, 2021, we
had 145 employees in our regional sales teams.

Our sales teams are supported by our digital sales capabilities, which have taken on increased importance
in recent years. In the financial year ended October 31, 2020, we opened eight digital sales offices. We also
secured 1,254 online reservations through our digital sales offices and our “Reserve Online” tool in the same
financial year, which was equivalent to approximately 50% of our completions in the period.

The typical process and timeframe for a house sale is as follows:

     - _Site visits (week 0): at this stage, the customer typically undertakes multiple visits to the site to_
review the development and the available housing choices;

     - _Preliminary credit assessment (weeks 1-4): at this stage, the customer has narrowed down his_
or her interest. Our sales team refers the customer to an independent financial advisor to make
a preliminary credit assessment and evaluate mortgage eligibility;

     - _Reservation (week 4): the customer reserves the property and pays a nominal fee;_

     - _Exchange contracts (weeks 12-14): at this stage, the customer typically instructs a solicitor to_
undertake the conveyancing work, progresses the mortgage application and enters into a
contract for the purchase; and

     - _Legal completion (week 24-26): the customer completes the purchase and moves in, after the_
house is built and inspected for quality.

We pursue a sales strategy that blends the potential for margin enhancement through open-market sales
with the certainty, risk mitigation and cash generation of selling to Registered Providers. In the financial year
ended October 31, 2020, 74% of our sales were on the open market (which includes sales to private customers as
well as elective sales to Registered Providers that are agreed during the development of a site) and 26% to
Registered Providers as part of the Section 106 affordable housing obligations agreed in connection with the
planning consents required for our sites or as otherwise agreed with Registered Providers at the outset of
development. In comparison, in the financial year ended October 31, 2019, we sold 78% of our plots in the open
market and 22% to Registered Providers.

Open market sales are delivered primarily through our sales team, who are present at each site. We
typically design a sales area, including a sales office and show homes, to present a shop-window of how the site
will look once developed. We look to open these sales areas as early as possible in the development of our sites
to allow customers to experience what they may eventually purchase.

Conversely, sales to Registered Providers are agreed at the time of the planning process, pursuant to our
Section 106 obligations, in accordance with an authority’s affordable-housing policy. Through our strong
relationship with national and local Registered Providers we are able to agree commercially-driven elective sales
to Registered Providers subsequent to the initial planning stage, which serves an important tool in maintaining
sales flexibility throughout the life of the site. These sales are often only at a small discount to open market prices
as they benefit from grants or other funding (such as Affordable Homes Programme funding).

Although a relatively small proportion of our business, we treat private rental sector (“PRS”) sales as
complementary to our open-market and Registered Provider sales. PRS sales are location sensitive as they only
work on commercially acceptable terms in areas with strong rental demand and rental values. We discuss PRS
sales with our partners and seek to devise sales strategies on a site-by-site basis.

We completed sales for a total of 2,774 homes, 2,460 homes and 4,035 homes in the nine months ended
July 31, 2021, the financial year ended October 31, 2020 and the financial year ended October 31, 2019,
respectively.

As of July 31, 2021, our forward order book, which represents (i) plots that are contracted for but homes
have yet to be completed on the lot and (ii) plot reservations for which contracts have yet to be exchanged, was
approximately £503.2 million, comprising of 3,151 plots.

As of September 19, 2021, we had reserved, exchanged or legally completed almost all of our planned
sales for the financial year ending October 31, 2021. Furthermore, as of September 19, 2021, we had secured


-----

approximately 40% of our planned sales for the year ended October 31, 2022, 85% of our planned sales for the
three months ended January 31, 2022 and 45% of our planned sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022..

**_Cancellations_**

Once a customer has reserved a property, identified the particular home they want and paid a reservation
fee, they still have the option to cancel their reservation and receive a refund if they choose to withdraw from the
sale. The customer may cancel at any time before the exchange of contracts, and if they have purchased through
the Help to Buy scheme and have cancelled within ten calendar days of the reservation, they will be entitled to a
full refund of their reservation fee. Otherwise, the customer will be refunded the reservation fee less administrative
costs of £125. Once contracts have been exchanged, the customer may only serve notice to cancel the sale if (i)
we have not served the completion notice (confirming the date on which completion will take place) before the
long stop date specified in the sale contract; or (ii) we have made substantial changes to the property that were not
agreed in advance by the customer. If the purchaser does not serve notice to cancel where the property is not ready
and the completion notice has not been served by the relevant long stop date, then we may continue to build the
property, concluding as soon as reasonably practicable, and the customer must complete the purchase. If the
customer fails to complete the purchase on the completion date (once such date has been set), we may provide ten
days’ notice to complete the purchase, following which we will have the right to rescind the contract if the
customer still fails to complete the purchase. If we are to exercise our right of rescission, we may retain the deposit
and any accrued interest, claim damages if applicable and re-sell the property. If we fail to complete our
performance under the contract before expiry of the notice, then the customer has the right to rescind the contract
and to the return of their deposit.

**Our Customers and Customer Experience**

We have a diverse customer base, and in the financial year ended October 31, 2020, 75% of our sales
were on the open market (which includes sales to private customers as well as elective sales to Registered
Providers that are agreed during the development of a site) and 25% to Registered Providers as part of the Section
106 affordable housing obligations agreed in connection with the planning consents required for our sites or as
otherwise agreed with Registered Providers at the outset of development.

First-time buyers are one of our key demographics, representing 76% of our private sales in the financial
year ended October 31, 2020. First-time buyers with the benefit of financial support schemes from the Government
have historically proven to provide resilient structural demand and constitute a deep and relatively predictable
market. First-time buyers are typically “need to buy” customers, in that they are experiencing life events such as
moving out from parental homes or getting married. We serve a young and diverse customer group, with 73% of
private sale customers aged 35 or younger (based on statistics from a survey of 1,053 customers in the financial
year ended October 31, 2020). We generally do not have large exposure to customers in any particular occupation,
implying a well-diversified customer economic exposure. In terms of the way that our customers finance their
purchases, based on statistics from the same survey in the financial year ended October 31, 2020, approximately
68% of our private sale customers utilized the Help to Buy scheme, 30% were unassisted and 1% utilized the
Affordable Homes Programme.

Our strategy is not targeted at the relatively more discretionary and cyclical “home-mover” segment, but
instead is focused on the more affordable end of the market. As a result, our ASP is lower than the industry average
in each of the regions in which we operate:

Delivering high-quality new homes and delighting our customers is our top priority. As a business, we
are committed to providing our customers with superior levels of service, from providing comprehensive
information and guidance on customers’ new homes to dealing with issues and queries quickly and efficiently. As
a testament to our focus on customer service, in 2021, we increased our NHBC customer satisfaction score to
92.6%, achieving 5-Star Homebuilder status across our business. Our NHBC customer satisfaction score was a
5.7% increase on the results from the prior year, while our 5-Star Homebuilder status has improved from a 4-Star
status in 2020 and a 3-Star status in 2019.

We review our processes on an ongoing basis and continually strive to introduce further improvements
to allow us to deliver greater levels of customer service. We include all regional management teams in this process
to ensure improvements are delivered consistently across the entire business. Our bespoke quality inspection
process has enabled us to deliver greater and more consistent levels of quality control in the homes that we build.
We are continuing to develop our quality inspection process to introduce even more rigor to processes to make
sure we continue to deliver high-quality homes for our customers. In addition to the changes to our quality
inspection process, we have also developed a range of training programs for our people, which are regularly
delivered to ensure that they understand the importance that we place on delighting our customers. We maintain
close contact with our customers throughout their journey, from their initial enquiry, during the exciting process
of purchasing their new homes and after they move in, to ensure they consistently receive a high level of service.

We also provide other innovative schemes to assist our customers in purchasing, designing and moving
into their new homes:

      - _Home Options: this service allows customers to personalize their home to fit their individual_
style preferences. Customers can choose colors, designs, appliances and fittings to be included
in their home, including in the kitchen, bathrooms, interiors and gardens. We offer our
customers pre-designed standard packs and also allow our customers to select “additional
extras” to customize their house.

      - _Easy Move: this service assists customers in the process of selling their current homes by_
arranging for valuations, paying for agents’ fees and managing the entire process on their behalf.

**Health and Safety**

We are committed to our H&S performance and focus strongly on managing our risk throughout all
phases of a development, with particular emphasis on site risks. We have implemented clear policies, created best
practice guides and developed specific, robust performance standards for high-risk activities, such as timber frame
construction, carrying out work at heights, managing plant and pedestrian interface and avoiding damaging
underground services when excavating.


-----

Our H&S performance is overseen by our Executive Health and Safety Standards (“HSS”) committee,
which is comprised of our CEO, our executive and our HSS Director. The HSS committee’s terms of reference
include determination of our strategic objectives and improvement initiatives, H&S policy, performance
monitoring, assurance (internal and external audit) and maintenance of ISO 9001, 14001 and 45001 certification.

We received a Gold Award from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (“RoSPA”) in 2020.
The criteria for the award included, among other items, accreditation to ISO standards, levels of compliance with
guidelines for high-risk activities and objective H&S performance, including accident rates. The Gold Award is
the achievement awarded by RoSPA and is awarded to companies that can demonstrate:

      - excellent occupational health and safety management systems evidenced by strong third party
audit results and company culture demonstrated by answers to key performance questions;

      - a rigorous approach to occupational health;

      - high levels of compliance with control measures (evidenced by active monitoring of
performance) for principal risks;

      - low/reducing rates of error, harm (accidents and work related ill health) and loss (e.g. accident
and ill health costs);

      - no fatal or major injuries due to employer negligence; and

      - no significant enforcement issues such as notices and/or prosecutions.

In line with Home Builders Federation reporting requirements, our annual injury incident rate in June 2021 was
205 per 100,000 employed.

Following a recent Government announcement, in which the Government indicated that it was committed
to funding and supporting the removal of unsafe cladding on high-rise buildings, we have conducted a desktop
review and did not identify the need for any remedial works associated with the removal of combustible cladding
in relation to multi-occupancy residential structures in our legacy development portfolio. In support of industry
initiatives to improve fire safety moving forwards, we have become a registered signatory to the Building A Safer
Charter Declaration of Commitment, which is designed to drive a culture of change and action to improve building
safety, by making improvements to current practice and behaviors. We actively contribute to the NHBC Standards
Review Group and other industry working groups, to help ensure that our design, detailing and specification
represent best practice and are aligned to future change.

Our H&S management system and key processes such as the pre-qualification of sub-contractors,
inductions, training, incident recording and reporting are managed through contemporary platforms and
technology. This has also proved important in the fight against COVID-19, preventing contact between people
and reducing the risk of infection transfer.

**Environmental and Sustainability**

Our operations are also subject to national and local laws and regulations relating to the management,
use, storage, disposal, emission, and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances,
materials and wastes. We have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help ensure that we are in
substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws, including internal and external compliance audits,
national quality assurance certification audits (both centrally and regionally), monthly inspection of all
development sites by our H&S team and annual construction compliance audits of all sites by our H&S team. We
also engage a third party expert adviser (Waterman EHS) to maintain an environmental legal register for us,
identifying compliance requirements and assisting us in identifying and developing actions needed to comply with
forthcoming environmental legislation. Our priority areas of focus are carbon & energy, waste & resource
efficiency, remediation (with brownfield development being a core part of our business model), pollution & water
and ecology & biodiversity. We regularly review our objectives for each of these areas, driving continual
improvements across our business. We also provide regular environmental training for our staff.

Our environmental management system is certified to ISO 14001:2015. In July 2020, following
stakeholder consultation, we published our Sustainability Strategy in which we identified our material issues and
aligned our strategy to eight United Nations SDGs. Through our Sustainability Strategy, we are committed to


-----

minimizing our impact on the environment and biodiversity. Additionally, in working with Wildscapes, which is
a wildlife trust consultancy, we are looking to develop methodologies to support the delivery of a net gain in
biodiversity for future developments.

The protection of ecological features is essential to our business, as is the inclusion of sustainable
drainage solutions and green infrastructure strategies, supported by ecological assessments, to enhance and future
proof the sustainability and attractiveness of our developments. We also strive to address the future impacts of
climate change such as extreme weather events and overheating.

Another key component of our sustainability drive is the employment of advanced techniques and the
minimization of our environmental impact in our design and build processes. For instance, we have recently been
focusing on timber-frame construction, which, in addition to having a faster return on capital outlay, is also a
sustainable form of construction. We were an early adopter of sustainable building information modelling to
maximize development efficiency and align design to off-site manufacture and on-site assembly techniques.
Additional actions and practices that we have employed include the use of standardized designs to improve site
efficiency and control waste, modular homes provided by ilke Homes aimed at contributing toward a high-quality,
low-carbon and precision-engineered housing solution and participation in Gorton low carbon homes trials.

Approximately 96% of our construction waste was diverted from landfills in the financial year ended
October 31, 2020. Since May 2021, we have transitioned to 100% of electricity from renewable sources.

Our portfolio has been developed to meet the needs of our partners in the delivery of enhanced NDSS
space standards and mobility standards for a mix of tenure. Furthermore, given that digital technology is
considered to be one of the strands to achieving a healthier life and an essential element for enabling the flexibility
for home working, future developments will benefit from broadband fiber connectivity with speeds of one gigabit.
Through continued customer focus, we strive to innovate and develop our design solutions to meet the needs of
customers and partners with regard to flexible living, low/zero carbon performance and reduced running costs to
address fuel poverty.

**Risk Management**

We are exposed to risks particular to all our business activities and the environment in which we operate.
Therefore, risk management is fundamental to our business and plays a central role in all of our activities, from
identification and assessment of contract or development opportunities to bidding and delivery of contracts or
developments.

Our Board of Directors is primarily responsible for approving the risk parameters, credit policies and our
overall risk capacity. The Board of Directors oversees our risk management activities and periodically reviews
our risk management policies and procedures relating to strategic, operational and financial risks.

**IT and Technology**

Our core IT applications are a combination of industry standard off-the-shelf applications, software as a
service applications and innovative bespoke digital products. We currently use Construction Industry Solutions
as our main enterprise resource planning software (“ERP”), and have recently committed to the adoption of DXC
Home Builder One, a homebuilder ERP solution powered by Microsoft Dynamics 365. We have also recently
completed our implementation of Anaplan, the market leading financial planning and analysis system which
underpins key finance activities throughout the Group. We believe this platform will give us best in class systems
to take our business forward.

To lead our team in this period of significant transformation, we recently appointed Myles Gibbins to the
role of IT & Digital Director. Myles brings over 20 years’ experience in the home building industry and possess
exceptional knowledge and experience of delivering similar business transformation projects.

Over the past several years, we have invested significantly in digital technologies in order to re-engineer
the customer journey and make the process of buying a new home easier and more closely aligned to the
expectations of our young customer demographic. This investment ensured that we were able to sell homes
through our reserve online tool while brick-and-mortar sales offices were closed during COVID-19 related
lockdown periods. Recent enhancements to our digital technologies include a new appointment booking system,
an online “House Configurator” to allow new customers to add options and upgrade their new homes and an
online payment tool to enable all payments to be made through our website. In particular, the addition of the
booking tool has resulted in additional benefits to our business, including improved visibility on footfall to sites,


-----

which has in turn enabled us to optimize our staffing levels accordingly. Further enhancements are now in
development, including additional features such as identity checks and anti-money laundering checks.

We make use of Business Intelligence and Dashboards to support our internal monitoring and reporting
and strategic decision making. Additionally, our core desktop and server infrastructure has been aligned such that
each relies on Microsoft, and in particular, Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure. The alignment of these
systems promotes certain efficiencies and allows for the quick restoration of data and services in the event of any
disruption.

**Employees**

As of July 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,078 employees, including 61 part-time or contracted
employees, all of which were located in the UK.

The following table details our monthly average number of employees by function, during the periods
indicated:

**For the seven**
**months ended** **For the financial year ended**

**October 31,** **October 31,**

**Department** **2018** **2019** **2020**
Production .......................................................... 441 415 422
Selling and distribution ....................................... 139 139 139
Administration .................................................... 549 587 585
**Total ...................................................................** **1,129** **1,141** **1,145**

Our employees focus on project development, coordination and delivery, with actual construction subcontracted to third parties. As of October 31, 2021, we had an average tenure per employee of approximately 4.5
years. Together with our generally stable core management team, our employees and management have supported
us in maintaining long-standing regional relationships with our partners. Our employees are an important
component of our strong reputation and record of community engagement, both of which differentiate our offering
from our peers.

We have focused significant resources in developing the skills of our employees through in-house and
bespoke training and development programmers. We have made substantial investments in training our employees
and have been accredited by the Investors in People Community Interest Company as “Investors in People” since
2014. Additional e-learning modules designed to cover topics such as personal resilience, personal leadership,
building relationship as well as modules on delighting customers feature in the training programs for all customerfacing employees.

As of July 31, 2021, approximately 6% of our employees were trainees, apprentices or graduates, with
all of our apprenticeships complying with the National Apprenticeship Council’s scheme. We also run leadership
programs for our management, and are aligned with the Construction Industry Training Board. In May 2021, we
introduced a new graduate program and we are further looking to launch a “Contracts Manager and Site Manager
Development Programme” to support high performing teams. We maintain a good balance of internal promotion
and external recruitment in order to add to our talent pool.

We do not recognize or negotiate with any employee or sub-contractor unions.

We contribute to the KPP, which is an occupational defined contribution pension scheme whose assets
are held in independently administered funds. Separately, the Company has entered into the Underpin with less
than 15 members of the KPP, through an unfunded contractual promise falling outside the scope of pension
legislation. The Underpin, should it be applicable, is in addition to the benefits payable under the KPP. The
obligations arising under the Underpin have been calculated by a qualified independent actuary and accounted for
as a long-term employee benefit.

**Property**

We lease our corporate headquarters and registered office located in Doncaster, England. We further
lease nine properties (excluding properties being developed or being held for development) which are used as
office-spaces.


-----

We generally seek to enter into real-property lease agreements with a maximum lease term of five years,
with a tenant’s break-clause at three years. The fees payable under the majority of our leases escalate periodically
at a pre-agreed fixed percentage.

**Insurance**

We believe that we maintain insurance policies that reflect the risk profile of our business and are
consistent with best industry practices in terms of limitation of indemnity and scope of coverage. Our
management, as advised by our insurance broker, considers our coverage to be sufficient in amount and scope.

We maintain insurance policies covering a range of risks including those related to physical damage to,
and loss of, equipment and property and injury to employees and third parties, as well as claims and general
liabilities that may arise through the course of normal business operations as well as acts of terrorism. Our
buildings (for which we are responsible) and property, including WIP, are covered by “all risks” property damage
insurance, which includes physical loss, destruction or damage to the property, unless otherwise excluded, as well
as subsidence and theft. We renew our insurance policies annually.

Our homes come with either a ten-year NHBC comprehensive warranty and insurance policy or a tenyear LABC insurance policy for the benefit of the customer covering structural defects, improper environmental
remediation and waterproofing. In both cases, we pay the premiums for these policies.

We also maintain insurance policies for employees, with respect to work-related injuries, insurance for
all of our vehicles, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, pension trustee liability insurance and professional
indemnity insurance.

**Intellectual Property**

We own and have the right to use the trade names “Keepmoat,” “Keepmoat Homes” and the Keepmoat
Homes logo in the UK. As of July 31, 2021, we had obtained all intellectual property rights that we consider
essential to our business.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are
not involved in any other legal proceedings, nor are we aware of any threatened claims against us that we would
expect to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following summary of the material terms of certain financing arrangements to which we and certain_
_of our subsidiaries are a party does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by_
_reference to, the underlying documents. For further information regarding our existing indebtedness, see “Use of_
_Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results_
_of Operations.”_

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

On or about the Issue Date, the Company as original borrower and original guarantor and, inter alios, the
Agent (as defined therein), the Security Agent (as defined above) and Original Lenders (as defined therein) will
enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for a
revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of £70.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the Company, the Issuer and certain of the Company’s
restricted subsidiaries which accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as additional borrowers of that
facility and may be applied in or towards (directly or indirectly) financing or refinancing the working capital
and/or the general corporate purposes of the Group.

The Revolving Credit Facility is available in euros, sterling and certain other currencies readily available
in the relevant interbank market by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of letters of credit and ancillary
facilities (on a bilateral and fronted basis).

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes (in addition to other permissions under the limitation
on indebtedness covenant) the ability (without double counting against the limitation on indebtedness covenant)
to incur additional indebtedness under one or more uncommitted additional facilities within the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement up to an aggregate amount of the greater of £85.0 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA
(as defined in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”).

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility is available to be utilized from (and including) the Closing Date (as defined
in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) to (and including) the date which is one month prior to the maturity
date of the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilizations of the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to, for loans
denominated in euro, EURIBOR, or for loans denominated in sterling, a compounded reference rate based on the
Sterling Overnight Index Average compounded in arrear (“SONIA”) plus an applicable margin, which in each
case will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to
consolidated pro forma EBITDA (the “Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio”).

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the
Revolving Credit Facility. If SONIA is less than zero, SONIA shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made
under the Revolving Credit Facility.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit
Facility from (and including) the Closing Date until the end of the availability period applicable to the Revolving
Credit Facility at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin per annum for the Revolving Credit Facility. Commitment
fees are payable quarterly in arrear, on the last day of the availability period for the Revolving Credit Facility and
on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which the relevant lender cancels
its commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility in full.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.


-----

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest period
relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving
Credit Facility will be repaid on the termination date of the Revolving Credit Facility, being the date falling five
(5) years and six (6) months from the Closing Date. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the
Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to _de minimis_
amounts). The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory prepayment
of all amounts due to that lender upon a Change of Control.

A “Change of Control” for the purposes of the Revolving Credit Facility is defined as per the Notes,
and in addition, includes a change of control with respect to Holdco ceasing to own directly 100% of the issued
share capital of the Company or the Company ceasing to own directly 100% of the issued share capital of Issuer.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

Subject to the agreed security principles that apply to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Issuer, the Company and certain of its material subsidiaries will become guarantors in respect of the Revolving
Credit Facility on a first ranking basis.

The Revolving Credit Facility is secured on a first-ranking basis by the Collateral. See “Description of
_the Notes—Security.”_

Subject to certain adjustments and the agreed security principles that apply to the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Company is required to ensure that members of the Group that generate at least 80% of
Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”) (subject to certain
adjustments set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) are guarantors of the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (i) on the date which is 150 days following the Closing Date and (ii) thereafter on the date when the
annual financial statements of the Company are required to be delivered to the agent in connection with the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to
certain limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other
matters set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (and, to the extent such requirement is not satisfied
on such test date set out above, the Company shall ensure that it is so satisfied within 150 days of such date).

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain representations and warranties (subject to
certain agreed qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including, among others, (i) status,
binding obligations, non-conflict with other obligations, power and authority, validity and admissibility in
evidence, governing law and enforcement and pari passu ranking, (ii) no insolvency, taxation and no proceedings
pending or threatened, (iii) no default, financial statements, base case model and reports, (iv) intellectual property,
(v) centre of main interests and compliance with sanctions and anti-corruption laws, (vi) no breach of laws, and
(vii) shares.

Representations and warranties are made on the date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
certain representations and warranties will be repeated on the date of each utilization, on the first day of each
interest period (other than in the case of roll over cash drawings) and at certain other times.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments and exceptions) under the Indenture and the Notes.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a “note purchase condition” covenant which
provides that subject to certain exceptions set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Company may
not, and shall procure that no restricted subsidiary will, repay, prepay, purchase, defease, redeem or otherwise
directly or indirectly acquire or retire the principal amount of the Notes (or, in each case, any replacement or
refinancing thereof as permitted under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement from time to time). The


-----

exceptions to such covenant include (among other things) payments that do not exceed 50% of the aggregate
original principal face value amount of the Notes as of the Issue Date (the “Notes Purchase Basket”) or to the
extent the aggregate principal face value amount exceeds the Notes Purchase Basket, an amount of the
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are cancelled or prepaid in the same proportion by which the
Notes in excess of the Notes Purchase Basket are prepaid or redeemed or otherwise returned for value, until the
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility (and any additional facility established under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement) are reduced to £35,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies).

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Company and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions and
grace periods, including covenants relating to (i) authorizations, (ii) compliance with laws; (iii) provision of
guarantees and security and further assurance, (iv) compliance with sanctions, anti-money laundering and
anti-corruption laws and (v) center of main interests.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes a springing financial covenant requiring
the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio not to exceed a ratio to be set with 45% headroom versus the base
case model for the Revolving Credit Facility (the “Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio”). The Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of the aggregate principal amount of all indebtedness of the Senior
Secured Group under any super senior finance document, any senior finance document or any Notes, less the
aggregate amount of cash, cash equivalents and temporary cash investments held by the Group to consolidated
_pro forma EBITDA for the twelve month period preceding the relevant quarterly testing date and is tested_
quarterly on a rolling basis, subject to the aggregate amount of the outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit
Facility (and any additional facility established under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (excluding (i) any
utilizations by way of letters of credit (or bank guarantees), (ii) any utilization of any ancillary facilities (iii) any
loan under the Revolving Credit Facility utilized on or prior to the Closing Date and (iv) any amounts utilized to
fund any original issue discount) less the aggregate amount of any cash, cash equivalents and temporary cash
investments being greater than 40% of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility (and any
additional facility established under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) on the relevant test date (or, if
higher, such total commitments at the date of entry into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (the “Revolving
**Test Condition”).**

The financial covenant, if breached, will result in an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility
unless such breach is cured or remedied. The Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and
adjustments in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the
Indenture and the equivalent definitions described in this offering memorandum.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the Company to
cure or prevent breaches of the financial covenant described above by (i) the contribution of shareholder injections
by way of debt and/or equity to the Company (a “Cure Amount”); and/or (ii) repaying the Revolving Credit
Facility and/or any additional facilities established under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement using the
proceeds of a Cure Amount and/or cash available to the Group and/or re-calculating the Revolving Test Condition
by taking into account the proceeds of a Cure Amount and/or Group cash such that the Revolving Test Condition
is no longer satisfied (a “Repayment Cure”).

On receipt of a Cure Amount that is not applied in accordance with paragraph (ii) above, the Cure
Amount shall either be (x) added to consolidated pro forma EBITDA or (y) deducted from Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Debt (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). The equity cure right for cures under
paragraphs (x) and (y) above may not be exercised in aggregate on more than five occasions during the term of
the Revolving Credit Facility and may be exercised on up to two occasions in any period of four consecutive
quarters. A Repayment Cure may be exercised in consecutive quarters and there is no limit on how many occasions
it can be used.

If the financial covenant has been breached and no notice of acceleration has been served, but is complied
with when tested (or is not required to be tested) on the next test date or any subsequent test date (the “Second
**Test Date”), then the prior breach of such financial covenant or any event of default arising as a result will be**
automatically deemed cured. There is no limit on the number of occasions on which any such automatic cure may
apply.


-----

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as under
the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for additional events of default, subject
to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) inaccuracy of a representation or statement
when made, (ii) repudiation, rescission, invalidity and unlawfulness of the Revolving Credit Facility financing
documents, (iii) breach of the financial covenant (subject to equity cure rights) and (iv) material failure to comply
with the Intercreditor Agreement by certain parties.

**_Governing Law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with English
law although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions
scheduled to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with New York law
(without prejudice to the fact that the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

On or about the Issue Date, the Company, the Issuer, the Original Super Senior Agent, the Original Senior
Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent (each term as defined therein), amongst others, will enter into an
intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) to establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors
under our financing arrangements. The Notes shall constitute “Senior Secured Notes” under the Intercreditor
Agreement.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debts of the Issuer, the Company
and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (as defined below) or Third
Party Security Provider, when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors or Third Party Security
Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of
that debt will be subordinated, including upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions
and provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement.
It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it,
and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes and of the Trustee. Capitalized
terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the purposes of this description:

“Senior Secured Group” means the Company and any of its restricted subsidiaries from time to time.

References to the “Senior Secured Notes” shall include the Notes and any other notes, securities or other
debt instruments issued or to be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has been made available
to or by a member of the Senior Secured Group which are designated by the Company as Senior Secured Notes
under the Intercreditor Agreement and references to the “Topco Notes” shall include any notes, securities or other
debt instruments issued or to be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has been made available
to or by a Topco Borrower which are designated by the Company as Topco Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement uses the term “Senior Secured Notes Liabilities” to refer to the Notes and
certain other indebtedness of the Issuer, the Company, the other Debtors and the Third Party Security Providers,
and “Topco” to refer to (i) Maison Hold Limited as “Original TopCo” and (ii) any person that becomes a direct
shareholder of the Company and which has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Topco.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities,
Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities or Hedging Liabilities
(each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification by the Company that such New Debt
Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange,
set-off, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement
under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt Financing, each


-----

agent in respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorized and
instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security
document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as
the case may be) and/or to effect the ranking, priority guarantees and security of the New Debt Financing subject
to certain conditions, including as regards the terms of such security (which shall be, unless otherwise agreed by
the Company or otherwise required by the Company to the extent that the existing Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security is not being amended or released and the new Transaction Security or new
Topco Independent Transaction Security only secures the New Debt Financing, substantially the same as the terms
applicable to the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the
Finance Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries
who, after the Closing Date (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company or merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, or (ii) in
relation to an asset of any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the Closing Date (together an
“Acquired Person or Asset”), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of
such New Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions to the incurrence of such New Debt
Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter, including
subject to any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist and there is no requirement to offer that
security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt Document. No
security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be given by any member of the Topco
Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or Asset if
this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being
given under the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement); (ii) over any asset required
(including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness
(other than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted
Acquired Indebtedness); or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against
loss is prevented by the documentation relating to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an
obligation (including any payment obligation but not including an obligation to extend any Transaction Security
ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

Control as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and that any
Liabilities owed by a member of the Senior Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured

**_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_**

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following the
occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or
an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Security Agent
(acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the
Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below) issues a notice (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the
agent under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes
**Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has occurred and is**
continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur
of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has been
remedied or waived in accordance with the applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents or the finance
documents in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as defined
below) gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco
Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a particular Senior
Secured Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant
event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event
or set of circumstances or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a
Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a
payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of
an event of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco
**Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.**

**_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_**

Nothing in the second lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability
to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt
Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization of
interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a
payment stop notice.


-----

**_Cure of Payment Stop_**

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco
**Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments**
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that suspension
of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, at any time prior to the latest
to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date
and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”)
(the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor) receives or recovers from any
Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors
under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not prohibited under
the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—
_Application of Proceeds”;_

(ii) other than where specific set off provisions apply, any amount by way of set-off which does not give
effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other
litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third
Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined
below)); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event,

except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds” and in the case
of any Intra-Group Liabilities, any amounts received or recovered in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement (to the extent permitted to be received or recovered notwithstanding the occurrence of an
Acceleration Event);

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) other than where specific set-off or Net Debt Financing provisions apply, any distribution in cash or in
kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any Debtor, any
member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which is not in accordance with
the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or after,


-----

the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined below) in respect of that Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of
that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on
trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or distribute
that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the
receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time prior to the
Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from any Debtor, any member of the
Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement of security or from
a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any
proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received
or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application
_of Proceeds.”_

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to a Debtor, Material Subsidiary (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider (or, in certain cases, a member of the
Senior Secured Group), (a) the passing of any resolution or making of an order for its insolvency, bankruptcy,
winding up, dissolution, administration, examination or reorganization, (b) a composition, compromise,
assignment or arrangement with any class of creditors generally (other than any Secured Party), (c) a moratorium
is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (d) the appointment of any liquidator, receiver, examiner,
administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its
assets, or (e) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or
vexatious proceedings and which, if capable or remedy, are discharged, stayed or dismissed within 20 Business
Days of commencement or, if earlier, the date on which it is advertised (or such other period as agreed between
the Company and the Instructing Group), any proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied
will be withdrawn or will be unsuccessful or as permitted under any Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or in
any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a
Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled
to receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider (in the
case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct
the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing
to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities
to creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of
a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the
amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that
the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.


-----

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect
and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event in relation to a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider.
The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these
provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an
Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) or otherwise as
specified in the provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super Senior
Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), Senior Secured
Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of the Senior Secured
Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”), and
Super Senior Creditors representing more than 66⅔% of the Super Senior Liabilities (the “Enhanced
**Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it means the**
group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the enforcement regime
described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security” below;

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but before
the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 66⅔% of the Second Lien
Liabilities (the “Enhanced Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 66⅔% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Enhanced Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in
accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. Subject to the Transaction Security becoming
enforceable in accordance with its terms, if either the Enhanced Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions their respective representatives (and, if
applicable, the hedge counterparties) shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”)
to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties, which did not deliver such Initial
Enforcement instructions and those enforcement instructions shall be consistent with the Enforcement Principles
(as defined below).

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or if the Super Senior
Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Enhanced Majority
Super Senior Creditors, until such time as the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency
Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior
Creditor) is continuing, the Enhanced Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has
occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of
enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Enhanced Majority Super Senior Creditors
determine in good faith that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the expected
realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions they reasonably believe is
consistent with the Enforcement Principles (as defined below) before the Security Agent has received any
instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Enhanced Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the
Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the


-----

Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Enhanced Majority Super Senior
Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce
or cease enforcing the Transaction Security or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal, the Majority Second Lien Creditors, where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to
enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors, the Enhanced Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Enhanced Majority Second Lien
Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce
or cease enforcing the Transaction Security or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the
Enhanced Majority Topco Creditors).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give such instruction or
indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Enhanced Majority
Super Senior Creditors, to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in
the paragraph above, may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see
fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that:
(i) to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement chosen
should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash and
(iii) enforcement in relation to assets whose aggregate book value exceeds £5,000,000 (or its equivalent in any
other currency or currencies) or shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or other competitive sales
process, shall (if the Security Agent is requested to do so by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority
Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an internationally recognized investment bank,
firm of accountants or third party professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations in respect
of the relevant type and size of the assets concerned.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with
its terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Enhanced
Majority Topco Creditors) may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain
from enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance
with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator
of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at
any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security
Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party will have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under
the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than
the Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien
Creditors, with appropriate modifications for their relative position in the capital structure.


-----

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

Until the Priority Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group,

accordance with the terms of the Topco Finance Documents.

“Enforcement Action” is defined as:

(i) (A) in relation to any liabilities (other than unsecured liabilities) the acceleration of any liabilities or
making of any declaration that any liabilities are prematurely due and payable (other than as a result of

under the Debt Documents), putting on demand, making of a demand, requiring a member of the Topco
Group or Third Party Security Provider to acquire such liabilities (subject to certain exceptions),

was outstanding under the relevant Secured Debt Documents); or

(v) petitioning, applying, voting for or taking steps (including the appointment of any liquidator, receiver,
administrator or similar officer) in relation to the winding up, dissolution, administration or

Intercreditor Agreement or any of such Third Party Security Provider or member of the Topco Group’s
assets or any suspension of payments or moratorium of any indebtedness of any such Third Party Security
Provider or member of the Topco Group, or any analogous procedure or step in any jurisdiction,

-----

Creditors to the extent they relate to payments permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or the release of the
liabilities owed to such creditors in return for the issue of shares in the relevant member of the Senior Secured
Group provided that the ownership interest of the member of the Senior Secured Group is not diluted and any
relevant shares remain subject to the same Transaction Security as existed prior to the issue, and (F) proceedings

**Lender”), hedge counterparty, issuing bank, or agent or trustee in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities or Topco**
Liabilities to obtain injunctive relief, specific performance with no claim for damages or to request judicial
interpretation in relation to a Debt Document to which it is party with no claim for damages or in connection with
any securities violation, securities or listing regulations or common law fraud.

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply
in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities or any Transaction Security securing the Topco Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the
“Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes Trustee
or the Topco Borrower in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco Notes
Trustee, Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice notifying
any agent under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), senior secured notes
trustee, the Second Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”)
a Topco Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the earliest to
occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the “Topco Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider, provided that:

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Topco Creditors or a Topco
Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same
Enforcement Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the
Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not against any other member of the
Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve
or protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined above) in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor against
whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; and

(iv) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Topco
Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted
remedy).

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may
take Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in relation
to a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any later time, a
further Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in respect of the Topco
Liabilities.


-----

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may elect by giving
not less than ten days’ prior written notice to the Security Agent, to purchase all but not part of the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes
Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus
certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer
their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have
been payable under such hedging obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and
expenses in connection with any such purchase.

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall (and is
irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement or instruction from any
creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Company:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the
Company has confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release
and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a
disposal to a member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any
obligation of any member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to
provide replacement security; and

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents pursuant to which that
asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior Secured Group; and

in each case where such disposal or other transaction is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) (in each case, a “Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to the extent that the
Company has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document to effect
any amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligation or take
any action in relation to such document or agreement;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of
the Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor to the
extent that the Company has confirmed that such ceasing to be a Debtor or guarantor in
accordance with the terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent
that the Company has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or such release in
accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement); and

(ii) in the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, other member of the Senior
Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a
Debtor, other member of the Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease to
be a member of the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or other
member of the Senior Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the
Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents


-----

(including any claim relating to a Debt Document) to the extent that the Company has confirmed that
such disposal or other transaction is otherwise in accordance with the terms of each Finance Document.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) or (ii) above, the Company
shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as of the
date of completion of such release or, at the option of the Company, on the date that the definitive agreement for
such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Company shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or
cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security Principles
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the
Senior Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor
or by designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent the Company has confirmed to the Security Agent
that it is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower,
issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person will have the right to voluntarily prepay all
Liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document.

_Distressed Disposals_

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a
member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider any such assets or shares
or financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security, which is being effected (a) at the request of
an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an
acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event, or (c) after
the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of security as a result of an acceleration event, by a
Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Topco Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at
the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Company and to the maximum extent
allowed by applicable law, without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor
under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of that
Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any
consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that Debtor
and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities,
(B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets
and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or another
Debtor (and any claim of a Debtor arising as part of any Cash Management Services) over that Debtor’s
assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding company
or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets and (C) any other claim of an intra- group
lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor (and any claim of a Debtor arising as part
of any Cash Management Services) over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a
Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose
of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their subsidiaries
to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend
that any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Creditor


-----

or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or
enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that,
notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated
as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all
(and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other
liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a
Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed
Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group
liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities (and liabilities
owed to a Debtor as part of any Cash Management Services) or liabilities to any Debtor on
behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are owed and
on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities)
to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities,
liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the
obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described in paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an
enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that
disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above)
effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair
market price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent has no obligation to postpone any
such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Enhanced Majority Second Lien Creditors
are entitled to give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent
is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities or other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities or other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case
of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the
subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Enhanced Majority Topco Creditors are
entitled to give, and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent
is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities or other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those
borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second
Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of
credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements
acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities would otherwise be released
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities,


-----

guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Company, in which case the
Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Company and without any
consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as
are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities.

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a
disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that the Second Lien
Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities and Transaction Security securing Second Lien Liabilities and/or Topco
Liabilities will be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release that
either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent, Second Lien Notes Trustee (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), Topco
Agent and Topco Notes Trustee (as applicable) have approved the release; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities or Topco
Guarantor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other
marketable securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or substantially
in cash) and/or other marketable securities, a valuation opinion has been obtained in accordance
with the provisions set out below; and

(B) all claims of the Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (other than in
relation to performance bonds, Guarantee or similar instruments issued by a Secured Creditor
on behalf of a member of the Senior Secured Group) against a member of the Senior Secured
Group (if any), all of whose shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of
the Senior Secured Group) are charge in favor of the Priority Secured Parties are sold or
disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged
or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one
of its affiliates), and all Transaction Security, Topco Independent Transaction Security or other
security in favor of the Secured Parties in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is
simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale,
provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or
discharge):

(1) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent
and any senior secured notes trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith,
that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover more than if such claim was not released
or discharged but nevertheless less than the outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, and
(ii) serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

(2) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second Lien
Agent and any second lien notes trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good
faith that the Priority Secured Parties (collectively) will recover more than if such claim
was not released or discharged but nevertheless less than the outstanding amount of
the liabilities owed to the Priority Secured Parties (the “Priority Secured Liabilities”),
and (ii) serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;
and

(3) where the Topco Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Topco Agent and the
Topco Notes Trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the Priority
Secured Parties and the Topco Creditors (collectively) will recover more than if such
claim was not released or discharged but is nevertheless less than the outstanding
Priority Secured Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (collectively), and (ii) serve a
notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same,

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to
such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer
may be in the form of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior Secured Creditors, Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (whichever constitutes the Instructing Group) bidding by an
appropriate mechanic for all or part of the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or


-----

Topco Liabilities (as applicable) such that the relevant liabilities would on completion be
discharged to the extent of an amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant
creditors; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(1) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process run in accordance with
the advice of an internationally recognized investment bank, firm of accountants or
third party professional firm with a view to obtaining the best price reasonably
obtainable taking into account all relevant circumstances and in which the Second Lien
Creditors and Topco Creditors are entitled to participate as prospective buyers and/or
financiers (including as part of a consortium); or

(2) where an internationally recognized investment bank, firm of accountants or third party
professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing such valuations has
delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation) in respect of such sale or
disposal that the amount is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all
relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability
of such investment bank, firm of accountants or third party professional firm in giving
such opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first
date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses
are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures at
the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the Enforcement
Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall
require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses
are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended
or waived only with the consent of the Company, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security
Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and
such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the interests
of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected
class shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above, the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement or the provisions set out under “—Turnover” above shall not be
made without the consent of (i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance
documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco
Liabilities, (ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (but only to the extent that the proposed amendment or
waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender
under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any
other creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each Hedge Counterparty (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (but
only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely
affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and (iv) the Company.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or
authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to
any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

**_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_**

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent
may, if the Company consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant consents
under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which shall be
binding on each party. provided that any amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document
creating Transaction Security which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to Transaction
Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security are distributed shall not be made without the consent of (i) each of the agents or trustees
(acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior
Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (but other than the agent in respect of any Cash
Management Facility), (ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (but only to the extent that the proposed
amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management
Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each Hedge Counterparty (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely
affect the rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not


-----

materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and (iv) the
Company.

**_Exceptions_**

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including,
without limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement)
may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph, the provisions set out under “—Required Consents” and the first paragraph
above under “—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions
under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security, claim or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each
case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the
incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,” “—
_Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent_
effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected
solely by the Company and the Security Agent.

In all cases, no amendment, waiver or consent under or in connection with this Intercreditor Agreement
shall require the consent of any Unsecured Creditor unless such amendment, waiver or consent is expressed to
impose additional restrictions on the rights or increases the obligations of any Unsecured Creditor under the
finance documents relating to the liabilities owing to those Unsecured Creditors (without a corresponding
restriction or increase in obligation applicable in a similar manner to any other class of creditors) in which case
such amendment, waiver or consent shall also require the consent of the Unsecured Creditors representing more
than 50% of the unsecured liabilities at that time.

**_Provisions Following an IPO_**

On, following or in contemplation of an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group
(or a holding company thereof) (an “IPO”), the Company is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt
Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all related
provisions) will now refer to the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the Company who
will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if any
Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any
holding company of the Company which is the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO
Pushdown Entity, (iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and
events of default) will cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released
from all obligations under the Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security and Topco Independent
Transaction Security) and each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be released from its obligations and
restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and
as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien
Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing
more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), the Company and each subsidiary of
the Company shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and
from the Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (other than a member of the Senior Secured Group) shall be required to enter into any amendment,
release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters; provided that such amendment,
release or replacement or other document or instrument does not impose personal obligations on the Security
Agent or any applicable agent or trustee or affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the
Security Agent or any applicable agent or trustee under the applicable Debt Documents.


-----

**_Agreement to Override_**

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other
Debt Documents (including the Indenture and the Notes) to the contrary.

**Company PIK Loan**

The Company, as borrower, and Holdco, as lender, will enter into an unsecured interest bearing
intragroup loan agreement (the “Company PIK Loan”), the proceeds of which, together with the Revolving
Credit Facility, will be used to (i) fund the consideration payable for the Acquisition, (ii) repay Existing Target
Indebtedness, (iii) repay Sellers transaction costs, and (iv) pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the Transactions.

The Company PIK Loan will bear an arm’s length interest rate. Interest will capitalize annually. The
Company PIK Loan will mature on the later of: (i) six months after the maturity date of the Notes; or (ii) on
demand a date no earlier than six months following the final maturity of all present and future liabilities and
obligations of the Company under both the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Notes. Any rights to
repay early are subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and, except as otherwise required by law, all
payments will be made without deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event
that the Company is required to make any such deduction or withholding, it will pay to Holdco such amount as
Holdco would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

All liabilities under the Company PIK Loan will be Subordinated Liabilities (as such term is defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement) and will further be subordinated to the repayment rights of all other secured or
unsecured creditors of the Company from time to time, other than any rights in respect of any shares or equity in
the Company or loans or bonds (in either case on terms substantially equivalent to the Company PIK Loan).

**Proceeds Loan**

Upon release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Accounts, the Issuer, as lender, and the
Company, as borrower, will enter into a proceeds loan agreement (the “Proceeds Loan Agreement”) pursuant to
which the gross proceeds of the Offering will be on-lent by the Issuer to the Company, who will then apply the
proceeds of the Proceeds Loan as set forth under “Use of Proceeds” (the “Proceeds Loan”).

The Proceeds Loan will be denominated in pound sterling and will be in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes. The Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a rate at least equal to the interest
rate of the Notes. Interest on the Proceeds Loan will be payable semi-annually in arrear on or prior to the
corresponding dates for the payment of interest on the Notes.

The Proceeds Loan Agreement will provide that the Company will pay the Issuer interest and principal
due and payable on the Notes and any Additional Amounts due thereunder. All amounts payable under the
Proceeds Loan will be payable to such account or accounts with such person or persons as the Issuer may
designate. The maturity date of the Proceeds Loan will be the same as the maturity date of the Notes. Except as
otherwise required by law, all payments under the Proceeds Loan Agreement will be made without deductions or
withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that the Company is required to make any such
deduction or withholding, such entity shall gross-up each payment to the Issuer to ensure that the Issuer receives
and retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding
been made.

The Proceeds Loan will provide that the Company will make all payments pursuant thereto on a timely
basis in order to ensure that the Issuer can satisfy its payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture, taking
into account the administrative and timing requirements under the Indenture with respect to amounts payable on
the Notes.

**Development Land Payables**

In the course of our business, we enter into arrangements with land partners which include deferred
payment terms for the acquisition of land, whereby we pay for land over time aligned to milestones which typically
include “payments per plot” made on legal completion or installments made on the legal completion of defined
cumulative plot numbers or on reaching an equivalent development milestone. In addition, our arrangements with
land partners may include overage mechanisms, whereby we make additional payments to the development
partner following completion of the land sale contingent upon exceeding agreed financial thresholds, with such


-----

payments often deferred to the end of the development of a site or a significant phase of the development.
Together, the deferred land payment obligations and overage obligations comprise our land creditor commitments.

Our obligations to land creditors were £217.9 million as of July 31, 2021, and are recorded as
“development land payables” within “trade and other payables” on our balance sheet. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Liquidity and Capital Resources—_
_Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments.”_

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

_You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the_
_heading “—Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” (i) references to the “Issuer”_
_refer only to Maison FinCo plc, (ii) references to the “Company” refer only to Maison Bidco Limited and not to_
_any of its subsidiaries, and (iii) references to “we,” “our,” “us” or “Group” refer to the Company and the_
_Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries._

The Issuer will issue £275.0 million aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured Notes due
2027 (the “Notes”) under an indenture to be dated          , 2021 (the “Indenture”), among, inter alios, the
Issuer, the Guarantors (as defined below), Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and
GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as security agent (the “Security Agent”) and paying agent, in a private
transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not
incorporate or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended,
including Section 316(b) of such act.

The gross proceeds of this offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be on-lent to the Company.
In turn, the Company will use the proceeds, together with the Equity Contribution, to be used to: (i) fund the
consideration payable for the Acquisition, (ii) repay existing indebtedness of the Target Group, (iii) repay
transaction costs of the sellers, and (iv) pay related fees and expenses incurred.

Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described
below, the Issuer will, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, but only to the
extent the Acquisition will not complete on or shortly after the Issue Date, deposit, or cause to be deposited on its
behalf, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account
(as defined below). In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined below) occurs and the Escrow
Agent (as defined below) shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) on
or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent in writing that, in the good faith judgment of
the Company, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will
redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the issue price
of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the
Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”
Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and the
Company and will not be guaranteed by the Target or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming the Completion Date
occurs on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date and the funds are released from the Escrow Accounts (as defined
below), the Post-Closing Guarantors will, within 150 days from (and excluding) the Completion Date, subject to
the Agreed Security Principles and substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility, accede to the Indenture (as defined below) and the Intercreditor Agreement
and guarantee the Notes on a senior secured basis.

Prior to the Completion Date, neither the Company nor the Issuer will control Keystone Topco Limited
(the “Target”) or any of its Subsidiaries (together, the “Target Group”), and no member of the Target Group
will be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that,
prior to the Completion Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been
prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities on the Issue Date and any such
non-compliance will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Completion
Date.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the
relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the
procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations,
release of security and guarantees, and the priority of payment for amounts received by the Security Agent. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and
the Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Proceeds Loan, the Escrow Agreement and the
Security Documents. This description does not restate those agreements in their entirety. Since this description is
only a summary of the terms of the Notes, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor


-----

Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of
the Issuer and the Guarantors and your rights because they, and not this summary, define your rights as Holders
of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth
under “Listing and General Information.”

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and will be subject
to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will initially be senior obligations solely of the
Issuer, guaranteed solely by the Company, secured by the Issue Date Collateral (as defined below) and the
respective Escrowed Property (as defined below) (but only to the extent the Acquisition will not complete on or
shortly after the Issue Date) and will not have the benefit of any Guarantees or any other credit support from any
member of the Target Group. Prior to the Completion Date, neither the Company nor the Issuer will control the
Target or the Target Group, and the Target Group will not be subject to the covenants described in this
“Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Completion Date, the Target Group
will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been
applicable to such entities on the Issue Date and any such non-compliance will not constitute a Default or Event
of Default under the Indenture prior to the Completion Date.

The Notes will:

        - be general senior secured obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

        - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer
that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the
Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;

        - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (if any);

        - be effectively senior to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer that
is not secured by the Collateral owned by the Issuer, to the extent of the value of such
Collateral;

        - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer
that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value
of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;

        - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the Subsidiaries of the
Company that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors;

        - be guaranteed on the Issue Date by the Company, and on the Post-Closing Date by each
other Guarantor;

        - mature on          , 2027; and

        - be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances
may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral on a _pari passu_ basis with all indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes; _provided_ that the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that with respect to a distressed
disposal of, or an enforcement over, the Collateral, the Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such
enforcement only after (i) creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) certain hedging counterparties and
(iii) other Indebtedness Incurred in the future that is permitted to be secured on a super senior basis have been
repaid in full.


-----

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer,
guaranteed by the Company, secured by the Issue Date Collateral and the respective Escrowed Property (but only
to the extent the Acquisition will not complete on or shortly after the Issue Date) and will not have the benefit of
any Guarantees or any other credit support from any member of the Target Group. Prior to the Completion Date,
neither the Company nor the Issuer will control the Target or the Target Group, and the Target Group will not be
subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to
the Completion Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by
the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities on the Issue Date and any such non-compliance
will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Completion Date.

Upon being granted, the Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

        - be a general senior secured obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—
Security”;

        - rank _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that_
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee, including
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;

        - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor
that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (if any);

        - be effectively senior to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor
that is not secured by the Collateral owned by that Guarantor, to the extent of the value of
such Collateral;

        - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such
Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Notes Guarantee,
to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and

        - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the Subsidiaries of such
Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
relevant Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance or corporate
benefit under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law, as well as to the extent
provided in the Agreed Security Principles. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Notes Guarantor may
have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our
_Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.” The validity_
and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations
described in “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Principal, Maturity and Interest_**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue £275.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes
will mature on          , 2027. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in
integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive payments of interest on such Notes are
subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s
current practice is to make payments in respect of Global Notes to participants of record that hold an interest in
the relevant Global Notes on the business day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date. If the
due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due
to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business
Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay. If
a regular record date is not a Business Day, the record date shall not be affected.


-----

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum and will be payable, in cash, semiannually in arrear on           and           of each year, commencing on          , 2022, to holders
of record on the immediately preceding           and          , respectively. Interest on the Notes will
accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of
original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of actual days elapsed in a year of 365 days. Each interest
period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which £275 million aggregate principal
amount of Notes will be issued in this offering. The Issuer may issue additional Notes (the “Additional Notes”)
from time to time under the Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. Any
series of Additional Notes issued may differ from the Notes issued in this offering in respect of any of the
following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate (defined below) supplied to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and,
if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates,
the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest
shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the
determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest
will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of
the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished
for such series in such Officer’s Certificate. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture
and this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Notes
initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes. Additional Notes may be designated to be of
the same series as a series of Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially
identical in all material respects to such series of initial Notes, and shall be deemed to form one series and
references to such series of Notes shall be deemed to include the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well
any such Additional Notes. In the event that any Additional Notes may not be fungible with any Notes previously
issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Issuer may arrange for
such non-fungible Additional Notes to be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities
identification number, as applicable.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will
be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified
by the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents
maintained for such purpose in London. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at


-----

the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of
Holders of Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes in London, including the initial Paying
Agent. The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the “Paying Agent”). The Issuer
will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar
will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the initial Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A.
The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and
together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the
Notes shall be maintained at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of
Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the register kept by the Issuer
shall prevail.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice
to the Holders of such Notes. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in
respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without interest
coupons attached, as follows:

        - Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A
Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee; and

        - Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global
Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be
deposited with and registered in the name of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to
_Investors.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the
“Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under
the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule
144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in
accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become
a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it


-----

will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
£100,000 in principal amount, and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued
in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on
transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of £100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive
Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or
exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish
information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish
certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such
transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with
such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will
be entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

To the extent this offering of the Notes is consummated more than three Business Days prior to the
anticipated consummation of the Acquisition, substantially concurrently with the closing of the offering of the
Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuers will enter into an escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified
from time to time, the “Escrow Agreement”) among the Issuers, the Trustee, and Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch, as escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its successors, the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which
the Issuer will deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the
Notes sold on the Issue Date into one escrow account (the “Escrow Account”). No Escrow Account will be
established on the Issue Date to the extent the Acquisition is anticipated to complete on or shortly after the Issue
Date. The Escrow Account, if established, will be segregated from the Issuer’s other funds. The Escrow Account
will be controlled by the Escrow Agent, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee
and the Holders of the Notes. Any initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities,
interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account in connection
with the Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement such as ordinary
course charges and fees paid to the bank holding the Escrow Account) are referred to, collectively, as the
“Escrowed Property.” Interest will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes.
See “Risk Factors—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuer
_will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Account will not have sufficient funds to cover such_
_redemption without relying on an additional equity investment from the shareholders.”_

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of the Notes, the
Issuer will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, subject to certain liens of
the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account and the Issuers’ rights under the Escrow
Agreement, pursuant to one or more escrow account charges dated the Issue Date between the Issuer, the Trustee
and the Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Charges”); provided, however, that such liens and security interest shall


-----

automatically be released and terminate upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s
Certificate (as defined below) or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined below). The Escrow
Charges will provide that the funds will be segregated and held for the purposes specified herein. By its acceptance
of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as directed by the
Issuer in such short-term liquid investments (including bank deposit products) as permitted under the Escrow
Agreement, and liquidate such investments, as the Issuer will from time to time direct in writing.

To the extent needed, the Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from the
Escrow Account, upon instruction of the Company or the Issuer, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount
equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue
Date or the most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to
the Escrow Release in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the Notes under the Indenture
as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In addition, the Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property in respect of negative interest having
accrued on the Escrowed Property.

Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in the
previous paragraph, the Company and the Issuer will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed
Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company or the Issuer) (the
“Escrow Release”) (the date of the Escrow Release being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon
delivery to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee, on or prior to December 31, 2021 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”),
of an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”), upon which the Escrow Agent and the
Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further investigation, certifying that the following conditions
(collectively, the “Escrow Conditions”) will be met substantially concurrently with or promptly following (that
is, within three Business Days) the Release on the Escrow Release Date:

(1) on or prior to the Completion Date, the Equity Contribution necessary to complete the Acquisition will
have been made;

(2) the Acquisition will be consummated promptly (that is, within three Business Days) following release of
the Escrowed Property, on the terms as described in the Offering Memorandum under the section
“Summary—The Transactions,” except for any changes or other modifications or waivers to such terms
that will not (when taken as a whole) have a material adverse effect on the Holders;

(3) immediately after consummation of the Acquisition, the Company will own, directly or indirectly,
100.0% of the share capital of the Target; and

(4) at the time the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate is delivered, there shall not be an Event of Default
with respect to the Company or the Issuer under Clause (5) of the definition of Events of Default.

Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Account in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the Escrow Accounts will
be reduced to zero.

In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall not
have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the
Escrow Agent and the Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will
not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (the date of any such event being the “Special
**Termination Date”), the Issuers will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the**
“Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of
the issue price of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid
interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below), subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Written notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company no later than one
Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agents,
and will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such
notice is given by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory
**Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying**


-----

Agents for payment to each Holder of Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes,
shall be entitled to use the Escrowed Property to make such payments and, concurrently with the payment to such
Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Issuer. Notice of such Special Mandatory
Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date.

The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest or Additional Amounts
owing to Holders of the Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that
the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes exceeds
the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes and, if the Escrow
Accounts alone do not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption and, as such, the Issuer will be required to
obtain the necessary funds elsewhere, such as equity investment from shareholders.

The Company or the Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or
more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which in each case must be an Initial
Purchaser or one or more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the Escrowed
Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being deemed a
Release; _provided that the Company and the Issuer provide a substantially equivalent security interest to the_
Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security
interest was initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; and provided further that use of the
funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Escrow Account.
In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which Escrowed Property is transferred shall be
deemed to be an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Company or the Issuer of an Officer’s
Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the
Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account. Any such new Escrow Account
will be segregated from the Issuer’s other funds, and shall be controlled by the Escrow Agent, subject to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority that the Special Mandatory
Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption.

In addition, the conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified
by Holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, only the Issuer will be a “Restricted Subsidiary” of the Company for the purposes of
the Indenture. Immediately after the completion of the Acquisition on the Completion Date, the Target and all of
its subsidiaries on such date will become Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company. However, in the circumstances
described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate
Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Issuer) as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not Guarantee the
Notes.

**The Proceeds Loan**

Upon release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Accounts (or on the Issue Date, to the extent
the Acquisition is anticipated to complete on or shortly after the Issue Date), the Issuer, as lender, and the
Company, as borrower, will enter into the Proceeds Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Issuer will loan to the
Company the proceeds of the Notes.

The Proceeds Loan will be denominated in pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount equal to the
gross proceeds of the Notes. The Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a rate at least equal to the interest rates of the
Notes. Interest on the Proceeds Loan will be payable quarterly in arrear in respect of the Notes on or prior to the
corresponding date for the payment of interest on such Notes.

The Proceeds Loan Agreement will provide that the Company will pay the Issuer interest and principal
due and payable on the Notes and any Additional Amounts due thereunder. All amounts payable under the
Proceeds Loan will be payable to such account or accounts with such Person or Persons as the Issuer may
designate. The maturity date of the Proceeds Loan will be the same as the maturity date of the Notes. Except as


-----

otherwise required by law, all payments under the Proceeds Loan Agreement will be made without deductions or
withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that the Company is required to make any such
deduction or withholding, such entity shall gross-up each payment to the Issuer to ensure that the Issuer receives
and retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding
been made.

The Proceeds Loan will provide that the Company will make all payments pursuant thereto on a timely
basis in order to ensure that the Issuer can satisfy its payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture, taking
into account the administrative and timing requirements under the Indenture with respect to amounts payable on
the Notes.

An assignment of the Issuer’s rights under, and receivables in respect of, the Proceeds Loan Agreement
will be granted in favor of the Security Agent as part of the Collateral, as described below under “—Security—
_General.”_

**Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture will be guaranteed on
a senior basis by the Company. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 150 days from the Completion
Date and substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit
Agreement, the Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior basis by Keepmoat Limited, Keepmoat Homes
Limited and M.C.I. Developments Limited (the “Post-Closing Guarantors”). The Guarantors also guarantee our
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain guarantee limitations as set out therein.

In addition, as described below “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that
guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility in the future or certain Credit Facilities or Public Debt, in each case, of
the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the
granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other
legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules,
“thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the
time or cost of granting the Notes Guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. For
a description of such contractual limitations, see “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” For further information on the_
Agreed Security Principles, see “—Security—General.”

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles,
to comply with general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, financial assistance,
fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and other similar laws, rules and
regulations of any applicable jurisdiction. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our
_Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.” The validity_
and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations
described under “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation,
winding up or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay
the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the
Company for application under the Proceeds Loan. As of and for the quarter ended July 31, 2021, the Guarantors


-----

(including the Post-Closing Guarantors) accounted for 99% of total assets, 100% of revenue and 99% of Adjusted
EBITDA of KM Group on a consolidated basis.

The Issuer is a finance subsidiary formed solely for the purposes of issuing the Notes and as of the
Completion Date its only material assets will be its rights and claims under the Proceeds Loan. As such, the Issuer
will be dependent on the Company to make payments on the Proceeds Loan for cash to service interest, principal
and other payments on the Notes. In turn, the Company is a holding company with its material assets being the
Capital Stock of the Target, which in turn is a holding company. As such, the Company will be dependent upon
its indirect Subsidiaries for cash to service interest, principal and other payments on the Proceeds Loan. The Notes
and the Notes Guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other
liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company’s non-guarantor
Subsidiaries. Any right of the Company or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries
upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation, winding up or reorganization (and the consequent right of the
holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that nonguarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer, the Company or such Guarantor is itself
recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer, the Company or
such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets
of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by the
Issuer, the Company or such Guarantor.

Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not
impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not
considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Notes Guarantees Release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will automatically and unconditionally terminate and be released
and discharged:

(1) upon (a) a direct or indirect sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of
any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company of such
Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary, or (b) the
direct or indirect sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (including by
way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) (other than to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary), otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes in accordance with
the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(4) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(5) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Notes Guarantees”;_

(7) as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(9) upon the release or discharge of the Notes Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor under
the Revolving Credit Agreement: provided that on such date after giving effect to such release and any
applicable clean-up period, the Guarantor Coverage Test (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) is met, calculated in accordance with, and in the manner provided by and subject to the same
exceptions as those set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as in effect on the Completion
Date; provided further that the Issuer is otherwise in compliance with provision “—Certain Covenants
_– Additional Notes Guarantees”; or_


-----

(10) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under
the Indenture and the Notes.

The Notes Guarantee of the Company will only be released upon the occurrence of any event described in
clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8), (9) or (10) above.

The Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) shall each take all necessary actions reasonably
requested by the Company or the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effect any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance
with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above
will be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent
on the part of the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Notes to
reflect any such release, termination or discharge. The Issuer may in its sole discretion elect to have any Notes
Guarantee remain in place, as opposed to being released.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, but only to the extent the Acquisition will not complete on or shortly after the Issue
Date and only to the extent the Escrow Account is funded, the Notes and the Note Guarantee of the Company in
respect thereof will be secured on a first-priority basis by the Escrow Charge. If applicable, upon receipt by the
Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption, the
Escrowed Property will be released and the first-priority security interests over the Escrowed Property will
automatically be released and terminate. No Escrow Charge will be granted, and there will be no Escrow Agent,
to the extent the Acquisition is anticipated to complete on or shortly after the Issue Date. In addition, the Notes
and the Note Guarantee of the Company in respect thereof will be secured on the Issue Date on a first-priority
basis by (collectively, the “Issue Date Collateral”):

        - a charge over all of the shares in the Company granted by Holdco;

        - an assignment over any structural intercompany receivables owed to Holdco by the
Company;

        - a charge over all of the shares in the Issuer granted by the Company;

        - an English law debenture granted by the Company over its material bank accounts and a
floating charge over all or substantially all of its assets; and

        - an English law debenture granted by the Issuer over its material bank accounts and any
structural intercompany receivable owed to it by the Company and a floating charge over
all or substantially all of its assets.

In addition, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially simultaneously with the
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by
(collectively, the “Post-Closing Collateral” and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”):

        - within 10 Business Days of the Completion Date:

          - a charge over all of the shares in the Target granted by the Company; and

          - an assignment over any structural intercompany receivables owing by the Target to the
Company; and

        - within 150 days of the Completion Date:

          - a charge over all of the shares in Keepmoat Homes Limited granted by Keepmoat
Limited;

          - a charge over all of the shares in M.C.I. Developments Limited granted by Keepmoat
Homes Limited; and


-----

          - an English law debenture granted by each Post-Closing Guarantor over its material
bank accounts and any structural intercompany receivables owed to it and a floating
charge over all or substantially all of its assets.

The Liens on the Collateral to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are referred to herein
collectively as the “Security Interest.” Any other property or assets over which Security Interest may in the future
be granted to secure obligations under the Notes and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.”

The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to
maintenance of share capital, fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable
provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with
general statutory limitations, capital maintenance rules, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and other similar laws, rules and regulations of any
applicable jurisdiction. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The_
grant and control of the security will also be subject to certain Agreed Security Principles. The following is a nonexhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which provide that Collateral shall not be
created or perfected to the extent that it would:

        - result in any breach of general legal and statutory limitations, capital maintenance rules,
corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination,
“transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign
corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital
maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, retention of title claims, employee
consultation or approval requirements (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable
jurisdiction (provided that the relevant grantor of security shall use reasonable endeavors
(but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third
parties) to overcome any such obstacle);

        - result in a material risk to the officers of the relevant grantor of security of contravention
of their fiduciary or statutory duties, any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual
prohibition or restriction and/or of civil or criminal liability (provided that the relevant
grantor of security shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and
without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle);

        - result in costs (including adverse effects on or with respect to taxes, interest deductibility,
stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable fees) that, in the opinion of
the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company (both acting
reasonably), are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that
security;

        - relative to any assets subject a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument,
regulatory constraint or to third party arrangements which prevent those assets from being
charged or assigned (provided that this does not prejudice the relevant entity from using all
reasonable endeavors to obtain consent to such charging or assignment), including without
limitation any joint ventures or shares in joint ventures;

        - have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant obligor to conduct its operations
and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the agreements to which it is
a party;

        - result in security being given over any Development Assets unless and until any such
Development Assets which otherwise are required to be subject to Transaction Security in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles have been unconditionally and irrevocably
released from any applicable third party security, liabilities or other arrangements in
connection with any development;

        - result in security being given by or over any acquired person or asset which are required to
support acquired (or acquisition) indebtedness to the extent such acquired (or acquisition)
indebtedness is permitted by the terms of the Indenture to remain outstanding after an
acquisition; or


-----

        - result in security being given over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party
(other than in relation to security under general business conditions of bank accounts which
do not prohibit or prevent the creation of Collateral over such accounts) or any cash
constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded
from any relevant security document).

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by
the Company.

The Liens securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will also secure the obligations of the Issuer and
the Guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, and may secure other future
Indebtedness Incurred after the Issue Date; _provided, however, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor_
Agreement, in the event of a distressed disposal of, or enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral,
the Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a superpriority basis have been repaid in full. In addition, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” each of the Security
Providers, the Issuer and the Guarantors is permitted to charge the Collateral in connection with future Incurrences
of Indebtedness, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition to the release provisions described below, the Security Interest will cease to exist by operation
of law or will be released, depending on the type of security interest, upon the defeasance or discharge of the
Notes as provided in “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” in each case in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Indenture.

There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the enforcement or sale of the Collateral would be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders, and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes
Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes
and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. By its nature, some
or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the
Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes and Our Structure—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.” In addition,_
the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to release the Security Interest,
by reference to the interests of other creditors of the group. These limitations may include requirements that some
or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to (a) public auctions or competitive sales process or (b) after
obtaining a valuation and fairness opinion. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral, the
Security Providers, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will have the right to remain in possession
and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, to freely operate the
Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part of
the Collateral, will be permitted to retain entitled and to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain
any and all cash rights to dividends and other distributions (to the extent not prohibited by the Indenture), stock
dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or
reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing).

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the Hedging Obligations secured
by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably
appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent, trustee, joint and several creditor and/or beneficiary of any
applicable parallel debt under the Intercreditor Agreement and with respect to the Security Interest, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
counterparties to the Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note,
each holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and
exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or
the Security Documents, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each
Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the
Security Agent on its behalf.


-----

The Indenture will provide that each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein). See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will also provide that each holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and
perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other modification or replacement expressed to be executed
by the Trustee or the Security Agent on its behalf).

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure—The security interests in
_the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of_
_the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Security Providers will grant security
over the Collateral to secure the obligations of the Issuer, under the Notes, and the Indenture and the obligations
of the Guarantors under their respective Notes Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be
entered into by, inter alios, the relevant Security Provider and the Security Agent.

The Security Agent will enter into the Security Documents in its own name for the benefit of, inter alios,
the Trustee and the Holders. The Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations and other secured Indebtedness Incurred after
the Issue Date (who will have the equal and ratable benefit of the same Collateral). The Security Agent will also
act on behalf of certain future secured creditors who are permitted to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof.

To the extent the proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be deposited into the Escrow Account, the
Escrow Charge shall be granted solely for the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the Notes, and no
other persons (including for the avoidance of doubt any lender under the Revolving Credit Agreement,
counterparties under any Hedging Obligations or any other creditors) shall be entitled to benefit from the Escrow
Charge.

The Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will provide that the rights with respect to the
Collateral must be exercised by the Security Agent or the parties to the Security Documents. Since the Holders
are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to
enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the Security
Agent.

The Security Agent will agree to any release of the Security Interest created by the Security Documents
that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the
Holders. See “—Release of Liens” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure—There are
_circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and_
_the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will be released_
_automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.” In addition, the terms of the Security_


-----

Documents and Intercreditor Agreement themselves provide for assets to cease to become subject to the security
interests in certain circumstances without need for a formal release, such as the sale of assets which are subject to
a charge, or the exclusion of certain assets from a debenture if such assets may not be subject to security (such as,
for example, assets that may not be validly charged, or assets that are subject to a Permitted Lien). The Security
Agent will commence enforcement action under the Security Documents only in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Enforcement of Security Interest.”

In the event that any of the Security Providers, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors enters into insolvency,
bankruptcy, dissolution or similar proceedings, the Security Interest created under the Security Documents or the
rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any
challenge to the validity of the Security Interest or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the
Holders might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Notes and Our Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations_
_on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity_
_and enforceability.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of
the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—_
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited_
by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause (1)(b) shall not be relied upon
in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or intercompany loan receivables to a Restricted Subsidiary
(except to a Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or
otherwise become subject to, a comparable Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(5) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets designated by the Company as Securitization
Assets in connection with a Securitization Facility;

(6) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(7) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance
with the provisions of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest.”_

To the extent the proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be deposited into the Escrow Account, the
Security Interests over the assets subject to the Escrow Charge will be released automatically in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Charge.

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably
requested by the Issuer to effect any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and/or the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the


-----

Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required
by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon
an Officer’s Certificate, certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security
Interests has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**_Enforcement of Security Interests_**

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce any Security Interest is restricted by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement by reference to the interests of the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” It may also be restricted by similar arrangements in_
relation to future Indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. Similar provisions may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered
into in compliance with “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

To establish the relative rights of certain creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors under our financing
arrangements, including, without limitation, the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging
Obligations, the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Trustee and the Security Agent will enter into
the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”
Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility and any Credit Facilities Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and any Hedging Obligations Incurred
pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” and permitted to be secured on the Collateral (see “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral_
_Liens”) will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon enforcement of any Collateral (other than_
with regards to the Escrow Charge) and certain distressed disposals. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement
over any Collateral (other than with regards to the Escrow Charge) and certain distressed disposals, only after any
sums owing to creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and other Indebtedness
permitted to be secured on a super senior basis have been repaid and such Hedging Obligations have been or
discharged from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the Indenture, the
Notes and the Notes Guarantees and any other obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be Incurred
and secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement will override the terms of the Indenture in certain respects. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that on or following certain Equity Offerings (or in
contemplation of certain Equity Offerings with respect to the release of security if required to implement such
Equity Offering), the Issuer shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the trustee under the Indenture (a
“Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Indenture and the other Debt Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) as described under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions Following an IPO.”

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the
Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem the Notes,
in whole or in part, at its option, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may on any one or more
occasions redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional
Notes), upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” with funds in an aggregate amount not
exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds received from one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price equal to
% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, on the Notes redeemed to but excluding the redemption date; provided that:


-----

(1) the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity Offering; and

(2) at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes)
issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately thereafter.

At any time and from time to time prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may on any one or more
occasions redeem during each calendar year up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including
the original principal amount of any Additional Notes), upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,”
at a redemption price of 103.000% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after          , 2023, the Issuer may on any one or more
occasions redeem the Notes in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a
redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, on the Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date and Additional Amounts, if any, if
redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on            of the year indicated below:

**Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2023 ................................................................................................................................................. %
2024 ................................................................................................................................................. %
2025 and thereafter .......................................................................................................................... %

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes (or any series of Notes
if Additional Notes are issued), including a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer
(as defined below), if Holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any
third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, for which all of the holders of the Notes will be deemed to have consented to such
tender or other offer and accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to
redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following the consummation of
such tender offer with consideration equal to the price offered to each other Holder of Notes (excluding any early
tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

**_General_**

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, we
may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the
redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date
in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**_Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund_**

Except as described under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the
Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described
under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”

As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Permitted Holders, their
respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding


-----

debt securities or loans, including the Notes or derivative instruments related thereto, in privately negotiated or
open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the
agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the
incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts
involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases
may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in
the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Registrar or the Paying Agent will select
the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on
which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee by the Company, and in compliance with the requirements
of Euroclear and Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection
and the Notes are not held through Euroclear and Clearstream or Euroclear and Clearstream prescribe no method
of selection, on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Notes in an unauthorized denomination remains
outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Note of £100,000 in aggregate principal amount or
less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of £1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the
Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable to any person for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but
not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date
if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion
of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other
transaction) and any redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent,
including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable,
shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (but not more than
60 days after the date the notice of redemption was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions
shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the
Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations
with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the
rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders of the
relevant Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Company will notify the Authority of any change in
the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state
the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to
the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions
contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the
redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on
Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

Except as otherwise required under the Indenture, in the event any Additional Notes are issued of another
series, the Issuer may elect to redeem or repurchase one or more series of Notes or a portion of a series of Notes
without redeeming any other series of Notes.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption


-----

price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below
under “—Withholding Taxes,” if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result
of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, introduction of, or change in an official written application, administration or
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a
holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative
practice),

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the
next interest payment date in respect of the Notes or the Notes Guarantee, as applicable, would be, required to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes or the Notes Guarantee, as applicable (but, in the case of a
Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by another Guarantor who can
make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts, or the Issuer), and such obligation cannot
be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly
announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions
shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on
the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party
to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and
setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied
and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable
measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified
under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated
to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to
rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any jurisdiction
in which any successor to a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or any
political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein. The foregoing provisions will survive any
termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each,
a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the
withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation
or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by
or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Notes Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of the Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental


-----

authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”),**

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect
to any Note or any Notes Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of principal, redemption price,
interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the
“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each holder in respect of
such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such
Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by each holder in respect
of such payments on any such Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided,
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present
or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident
or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of
management present or deemed present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership
or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such
Note, the Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or a
beneficial owner of a Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the
Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or
deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence or identity of such Holder or beneficial owner or to make any
declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is
required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax, but, in each case,
only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to provide such certification or
documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment
(where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30
days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available
for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of principal,
premium or interest on or with respect to the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current or future U.S.
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered
into pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as of the Issue Date (or any amended
or successor version described above), or any intergovernmental agreement (or any related law or
regulation) implementing the foregoing; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler
with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been
entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.


-----

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable
evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent).
Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the
offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and
the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional
Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days
prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as
practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely, without further enquiry,
on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties
with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any
related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,
issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Notes
Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in
connection with a transfer after this offering and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or
levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar
charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (6)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise resident for
tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any
Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Person, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency
thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party
makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently
therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (equal to £100,000 or in integral multiples_
of £1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Notes of £100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in
part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of
the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before
the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of
business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. No later than 60 days following any
Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of
Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by
first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the


-----

security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to
repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no
earlier than 30 days and no later than the later of (x) 60 days from the date such notice is delivered and (y) the
date of completion of the Change of Control Triggering Event, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in
advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under
the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture
by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the
SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute
a default under the Revolving Credit Facility that permits the lenders thereunder to accelerate the maturity of
borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries may contain
prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such
Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders
of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if
the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of
Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at
such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford
Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise
in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by
the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or
(ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under
“—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the
applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent
contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a
Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event; provided, however,
that such Change of Control Offer is conditional upon such Change of Control if either (i) a definitive agreement
is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer for the Notes is made or
(ii) a tender offer that the Issuer believes would more likely than not result in a Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control
Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.


-----

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that
the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any of the Company’s Restricted
Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if for the Relevant Testing Period
immediately preceding such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application
of the proceeds thereof), either: (a) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries is at least 2.00 to 1.00 or (b) the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 3.10 to 1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the Incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiaries of:

(a) Indebtedness under any Credit Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
guarantees, bankers’ acceptances, promissory notes, issued, incurred or created thereunder) in
an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the amount equal to the
greater of (x) £85.0 million and (y) 100.0% of Consolidated EBITDA at any one time
outstanding; and

(b) the maximum amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, for the Relevant Testing Period
immediately preceding such Incurrence and after giving _pro forma effect to such Incurrence,_
the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 2.90 to 1.00,

_provided that any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any time if such_
refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness permitted
to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of such refinancing and (II) the aggregate principal
amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together with an amount necessary to pay
accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs,
indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount,
upfront fees or similar fees) incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing);

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (b) without limiting the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person_
securing Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other obligations is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; _provided,_
_however, that:_

(a) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the obligee is not the
Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and such Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness that is outstanding for a period of less than 90 days or that represents intra-group
cash management transactions in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice) of the Issuer or such Guarantor exceeds £10.0 million, it is, to the extent legally
permitted, expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with
respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the applicable Notes Guarantee, in the case of


-----

a Guarantors and such condition shall be deemed to be satisfied if such obligee accedes to the
Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary,
and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such
Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as
the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), including any Guarantee
thereof and the Proceeds Loan and/or any “parallel debt” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents; (b) any Indebtedness of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding on the Issue Date and Indebtedness of the Target
and its Subsidiaries outstanding on the Completion Date or Incurred under a facility committed on the
Completion Date, after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Transactions; (c) Refinancing Indebtedness
Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) or clauses (1)(b) or (5) of this
paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant; and (d) Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness (x) of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, or any Person that will become a
Restricted Subsidiary or that will be merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, Incurred or issued to finance all or a portion of an
acquisition (including an acquisition of any assets or any Person) or (y) of Persons that are, or secured
by any assets that are, acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into,
amalgamated or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture; provided that Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to (x) and (y) of this paragraph (5) may
be up to an aggregate amount such that, after giving effect to such acquisition, merger or consolidation,
(a) either: (i) the Company would be permitted to Incur at least £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant or (ii) either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company
would not be lower, or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Company would not be higher,
in either case, than it was immediately prior to such acquisition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation;
or (b) to the extent such Indebtedness constitutes Senior Secured Indebtedness, either (i) the Company
would have been able to incur £1.00 of additional Senior Secured Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1)(b)
of this paragraph, or (ii) the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving pro forma effect to
such acquisition or other transaction and the related incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (5);

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative purposes, as
determined in good faith by the Company, and, for the avoidance of doubt, Hedging Obligations in effect
on the Issue Date (or, with respect to the Target and its Subsidiaries, after the Completion Date) shall not
be deemed to be for speculative purposes);

(7) Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries represented by, or consisting of,
Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase Money Obligations or other financings,
Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or
improvement of property, plant or equipment used in a Similar Business or Indebtedness otherwise
Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement
of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, or the purchase
of Capital Stock of any Person in a Similar Business whether through the direct purchase of assets or the
Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or
refunds such Indebtedness (including any fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing, together with any VAT related thereto) either
(a) Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or (b) otherwise in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, does not exceed the greater of
(i) £25.0 million and (ii) 30.0% of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, old-age part-time arrangements, selfinsurance obligations, unemployment insurance (including premiums related thereto), other types of
social security, pension obligations or partial retirement obligations, vacation pay, health, disability or


-----

surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment (including progress premiums), land purchase guarantees and
warranties, completion guarantees and warranties, performance guarantees and warranties, cost-overrun
guarantees, customs, value added or other tax or other guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments or
obligations (including performance guarantees with regards to lease agreements) and completion
guarantees and warranties provided by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities,
obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;
(b) the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn
against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; provided,
_however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within 45 Business Days of Incurrence; (c) customer_
deposits and advance payments (including progress premiums) received in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice from customers for goods, services or property (real or personal)
purchased in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; (d) guarantee, indemnity,

in relation to any such agreement or instrument entered into or issued by a bank, financial institution,
insurance company, public authority, housing authority or entity such as the NHBC and all other similar
instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course
of business or consistent with past practice; (e) the financing of insurance premiums, take-or-pay

Excluded Amounts) of the Company, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date, and any refinancing


-----

Indebtedness in respect thereof; _provided,_ _however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so_
received or contributed shall not increase the amount available for making Restricted Payments to the
extent the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any
Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds or cash have been applied to
make Restricted Payments;

(11) Indebtedness consisting of promissory notes issued by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
to any future, present or former employee, director, contractor or consultant of the Company, any of its

(13) Indebtedness in respect of any Qualified Securitization Financing;

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of
Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company,
in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and
only be required to include, in any manner that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph above
or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this
covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but
may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this


-----

covenant permitting such Indebtedness; _provided_ that any amounts outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Facility on the Issue Date shall be deemed to be incurred under clause (1)(a) of the preceding
paragraph and, for the avoidance of doubt, certain types of obligations (for example, Non-Recourse
Project Development Debt and Qualified Securitization Financing) may not qualify as Indebtedness to
the extent such obligations are excluded from the definition of Indebtedness;

(2) with respect to any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a clause limited by a fixed sterling amount in the
second paragraph of this covenant, if at any time that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant (other than to the extent such
reclassification would result in any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the preceding
paragraph to not be entitled to priority with respect to the proceeds from a distressed disposal of, or
enforcement of, the Collateral pursuant to the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens);

(3) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under
a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down”
provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to
be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the
date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof;

(4) in the case of any refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest
and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees)
Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, deeds of indemnity to
insurance companies, guarantee facilities or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing,
Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall
not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, deeds of indemnity to insurance
companies, guarantee facilities or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility
and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of the second paragraph above or the first
paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, deeds of indemnity to insurance
companies, guarantee facilities or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(8) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur
any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof
for all purposes under the Indenture, including without limitation for purposes of calculating any
Applicable Metric, or usage of clauses (1) through (18) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for
borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit, JCT
Building Obligations, deeds of indemnity to insurance companies, guarantee facilities and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will, at the Company’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such
revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount
thereof has been borrowed on such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,
and, if any such Applicable Metric is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or
reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, JCT Building Obligations,
deeds of indemnity to insurance companies, guarantee facilities and bankers’ acceptances thereunder)
will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Applicable Metric at the time of any borrowing
or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit, JCT Building Obligations, deeds of indemnity
to insurance companies, guarantee facilities or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount
permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, JCT Building


-----

Obligations, deeds of indemnity to insurance companies, guarantee facilities and bankers’ acceptances)
on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” on
such date for purposes of any Applicable Metric and, to the extent of the usage of clauses (1) through
(18) of the preceding paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such
clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or
increased commitment, and in each case, the Company may revoke such determination at any time and
from time to time;

(9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated
based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of
such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with
such refinancing; and

(10) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness,
the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”;_ _provided_ that the amount of any refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding
Indebtedness may (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized
interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness, or the additional shares of
Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock, in respect of such Indebtedness and such increased amount will not be
deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary on such date (and, if such Indebtedness is
not permitted to be Incurred on such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any pounds sterling-denominated restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness
was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Sterling
Equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so
long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid
interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount,
upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date or, with respect to the Target and its
Subsidiaries, the Completion Date, shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the Issue Date or the Completion Date, as applicable; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a
different currency is subject to a currency agreement (with respect to sterling) covering principal amounts payable
on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling will be adjusted to take into account
the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being


-----

refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

the extent any net proceeds from such Indebtedness are contributed to the equity of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary in any form or otherwise received by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary pursuant to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding, such net proceeds shall be excluded
for purposes of increasing the amount available for distribution pursuant to clause (c) below of this
paragraph and shall not be Excluded Contributions or Excluded Amounts, and (ii) to the extent any
net proceeds are contributed to the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries in the form of
Indebtedness (a “Parent Debt Contribution”), (x) there shall be no double-counting of interest paid
on such Indebtedness and any dividends or distributions payable to the relevant Parent Entity to fund
interest payments in respect of Indebtedness of such Parent Entity and (y) there shall be no doublecounting of interest paid on such Indebtedness directly in relation to any Guarantee of such
Indebtedness given by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one
year of the date of purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and
(b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(4) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or with respect to, or purchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other than

(5) make any Restricted Investment,

(any such dividend, distribution, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition, retirement or
Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) are referred to herein as a “Restricted Payment”), if at
the time the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:

(a) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would immediately thereafter result
therefrom);

(b) the Company is not able to Incur an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness in the first paragraph under
the “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant immediately after giving effect, on a pro forma basis,

_provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”)_
that would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments

amounts result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities
received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise have constituted
a Change of Control Triggering Event, (b) the purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt of such Net

capital stock (“Treasury Capital Stock”), the declaration and payment of dividends thereon was
permitted under clause (13) of this paragraph, the declaration and payment of dividends on the Refunding

will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or, in each case, a portion thereof) on the date
of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such
Restricted Payment or Investment (or, in each case, a portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this

Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such

Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment,
property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in good faith.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the Completion Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein
or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”),
except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens
on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the obligations under the Notes (or a Notes Guarantee in the
case of Liens on assets of a Guarantor) and the Indenture are directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles (but without regard to any Agreed Security Principles limiting the types or locations of assets that may
be charged to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees under the Indenture), equally and ratably with, or prior
to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien
for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes
Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in respect of the Notes under (a)(2) in the preceding paragraph will be automatically
and unconditionally released and discharged (i) upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it
relates, and (ii) as otherwise set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of
such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property
securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any

Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Company; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute
such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit
Facility), (b) the Intercreditor Agreement or (c) any other agreement or instrument, in the case of (a), (b)
and (c) in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date (or, with respect to the Target and its Subsidiaries,
the Completion Date);

Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Proceeds Loan,

Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary, was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is


-----

assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other
than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the
funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or
was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
or entered into in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the
purposes of this clause, if another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement
or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(4) any encumbrance, restriction or condition: (a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, leasing,
assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license, right of first refusal or
offer, or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract
or agreement; (b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under
the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer or encumbrance of the

in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or other agreement to
which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the ordinary course of

solely the property or assets of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject to such
agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other

Restricted Subsidiary; or (d) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property
interests set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes customary restrictions on the distribution
or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock or Indebtedness of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect
sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets (including real and

to such restriction), pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) (a) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements, rights of
first refusal or offer and other similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments; or

instrument will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make payments of
principal or interest on the Notes;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders
than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Revolving Credit Facility, together with
the Security Documents associated therewith, and (B) the Intercreditor Agreement, as in effect on the
Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Company),
(b) that the Company determines at the time of entry into such agreement or instrument (i) will not

the Notes or (ii) applies only during the continuance of a default relating to such agreement or instrument,
or (c) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (14) of this
paragraph or this clause; provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such
Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material
respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial
Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Company).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Company of the
shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition
(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is
in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (i) to prepay,
repay, redeem or purchase any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor
(in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary), any
Senior Secured Indebtedness or any other Indebtedness under any Credit Facility Incurred
pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” (or any refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 365 days from the_
later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash;
_provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment, redemption or_
purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an


-----

amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; or (ii) to make an Asset
Disposition Offer;

(b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or purchase or commit
to invest in or purchase Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional
Assets equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition
and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding agreement
shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such
commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will
be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable
**Commitment”) and, in the event of any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or**
terminated for any reason before such amount is applied in connection therewith, then such Net
Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds;

(c) (i) to purchase any Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such Notes at a purchase price
in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right
of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) or by making an Asset Disposition Offer to all Holders of the Notes (in
accordance with the procedures set out below); (ii) to redeem any Notes pursuant to the
redemption provisions of the Indenture, in each case, provided such offer to purchase is
launched or the relevant redemption notice is delivered within 365 days from the later of (A) the
date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; and/or (iii) to
purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise; and

(d) to consummate any combination of the foregoing,

_provided that, (1) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with_
clauses (a) through (d) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness
or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture; and (2) the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary (as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Net
Available Cash attributable to any given Asset Disposition (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier
than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Disposition, execution of a definitive agreement for
the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant Asset Disposition) and deem the amount so
invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with clause (b) above with respect to such Asset Disposition.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (1) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash
of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary of the Company to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (to
the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including
financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors)
or (2) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result
in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, the portion of such
Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute
“Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (1) a distribution of any
or all of the Net Available Cash from any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary of the Company to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable
law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary or statutory duties of the
relevant directors) or is prohibited by restrictions in any agreements relating to Indebtedness that are permitted by
“—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”; or (2) a distribution of any or all of
the Net Available Cash from any Asset Distribution by a Subsidiary to the Issuer, or any Restricted Subsidiary (to
the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in a material adverse Tax consequences, as
determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of the Net Available Cash so affected will not be required
to be applied in accordance with this covenant. On the 366th day after the later of an Asset Disposition or the
receipt of such Net Available Cash (or (i) such earlier date as the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries may
elect or (ii) such later date as set forth in clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant), if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds the greater of £25.0 million and 30.0% of Consolidated


-----

EBITDA, the Issuer will within 10 Business Days, be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to
all Holders of Notes issued under such Indenture and, to the extent the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary
elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of
Notes and to repay, prepay or purchase any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer
applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and not more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari
Passu Indebtedness, in each case, _plus_ accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements
governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and which may include in the case of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness that is Public Debt, such higher price as may be contemplated by the agreement governing such Pari
Passu Indebtedness (provided that such agreement has not been amended or modified to provide for such higher
price in connection with such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption and provided further that the excess
over 100% of the principal amount shall not be paid with Excess Proceeds), and with respect to the, in minimum
denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver notice of
such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions
that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the
date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date
such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the and described in such notice. The Issuer may,
at its option, satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition
by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant
365 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the
Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders
and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid,
prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and
such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in pounds sterling, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts
into their Sterling Equivalent determined on a date selected by the Company that is within the Asset Disposition
Offer period. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at
zero. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall
not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited
by the Indenture.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than pounds sterling, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net
amount of funds in pounds sterling that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into pounds
sterling.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) and the release of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in
connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from
any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;


-----

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated NonCash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the
greater of (a) £30.0 million and (b) 35.0% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each
item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value);

(6) consideration consisting of Additional Assets; and

(7) any combination of the consideration specified in the preceding clauses (1) through (6).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities
laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by
virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Indenture
relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may
be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding.

The Revolving Credit Facility may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to
which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this
covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its
lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If
the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the
Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under
the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the
rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
value in excess of £15.0 million unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of £25.0 million, the terms
of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
of the Company.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (ii) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Company,
if any.

The provisions of preceding paragraph above will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments,” or any Permitted Investment;_

(4) (a) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries and
(b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, provided that such Parent Entity
shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital
Stock of the Company and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise permitted under the
Indenture;

(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension or partial retirement
expenses provided on behalf of, and severance arrangements with respect to, (including any management

employees of the Company, any Parent Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly
and including through any Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors,
consultants, distributors or employees) and (b) the entry into, existence of, or performance by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of any employment and severance arrangements between the
Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, contractors, consultants,
distributors and employees in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or entered
into in connection with or as a result of the Transactions.

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under
the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any

with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any
material respect;

ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Company or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the senior management
of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that
could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or among the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity
that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely (a) because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary

an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity or (b) due to the fact
that a director of such Person is also a director of the Company, a Restricted Subsidiary or any direct or

the Company;

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer) to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an
Investment made at the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of
the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted
if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition
of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company may re-designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted
Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the
preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”
If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary on such date and, if
such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred on such date under the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness,” the Company will be in default of such covenant._

The Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of_
any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if
(1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including
pursuant to clause (5) of the second paragraph thereof treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the purpose
of such clause), calculated on a _pro forma_ basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable reference period; and (2) no Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the fiscal year ending October 31, 2021, 150 days) after the end of
each of the Company’s fiscal years, annual reports containing: (a) an operating and financial review of
the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of
operations, reported EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company;
(b) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates
(unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3)
below); provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available
without unreasonable expense, in which case the Company will provide, in the case of a material
acquisition, acquired company financial information to the extent applicable; (c) the audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated
income statements and statements of cash flow of the Company for the most recent two fiscal years,

the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (d) a brief description of the business,
management and shareholders of the Company, all material Affiliate Transactions during such fiscal year
and a description of all material debt instruments entered into or amended during such fiscal year; and
(e) a description of any material changes in operational risk factors and material subsequent events;
_provided that the information described in clauses (d) and (e) may be provided in the notes to the audited_
financial statements;


-----

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2022, 75 days) following the end
of the first, second and third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company, beginning with the quarter
ending October 31, 2021, quarterly financial statements containing the following information: (a) the
Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period ending on
the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with condensed
footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited _pro forma_ income statement and balance sheet information of the
Company, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or

only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Company will provide, in
the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financial information; (c) an operating and financial
review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial
condition, results of operations and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company;

subsequent events and any material changes to the operational risk factors disclosed in the most recent
annual report; and (f) reported EBITDA; provided that the information described in clauses (d), (e) and
(f) may be provided in the notes to the unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Company announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Company
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the
Company or the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Company, a report containing a description of such
event.

In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for
so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under
the Securities Act.

Any reports in respect of periods commencing prior to the Completion Date (including in respect of any
comparative information) may, upon the election of the Company, include only the consolidated financial
information of Keystone Midco Limited without any other financial information, together with certain unaudited
as adjusted financial information of the Company similar to, or comparable with, the financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information
_and Other Data—Other Financial Information” to give effect to the Transactions. For purposes of this covenant_
and any determination or calculation to be made under the Indenture, the Company may use financial statements
of a predecessor of the Company or Keystone Midco Limited for reporting or making calculations with respect to
periods commencing prior to the Completion Date.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of
such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis
for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on
a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of
the Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not
be required to contain any reconciliation to GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material only to the
entity or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Company’s _pro forma_ reported
EBITDA or total assets as of and for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports
have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of
this “Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial
statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Company.

In the event that (1) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports
required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (2) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed
with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP information, certifications, exhibits
or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Company will make available
to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company is, or would be,
required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing
requirements, the Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this “Reports”
covenant.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

At its election, the Company may provide consolidated financial statements of a Parent Entity in lieu of
those for the Company, in which case references to the Company in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the preceding
paragraph will be deemed to be references to the Parent Entity, as applicable; provided that if the consolidated
financial statements of the Parent Entity are included in such report, a description of material differences between
the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Entity and the Company shall be included for any period after
the Issue Date.

If and for so long as the equity securities of the Company, a Parent Entity, the Target or any IPO Entity
are listed on a Recognized Stock Exchange and the Company, a Parent Entity, the Target or any other IPO Entity
is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading
on a Recognized Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, the Company will be entitled to make available to the
Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company, a Parent Entity, the
Target or any IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with the Recognized Stock Exchange. Upon complying
with the foregoing sentence, and provided that such requirements require the Company or a Parent Entity to
prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with a Recognized Stock Exchange and
the Company additionally provides the reports set forth in paragraph (2) above with respect to its first and third
fiscal quarters, the Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding
paragraphs in this covenant. Such reports shall include a reasonably detailed description of material differences
between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Entity. “Recognized Stock Exchange” means a

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with
respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to
the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the
Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the
covenants described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation on Liens,” except that (a) the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise
modify or replace any Security Documents, for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens, (b) the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise
modify or replace any Security Documents, for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization or in
connection with a transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Merger and Consolidation,” (c)
the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (d) the applicable Security
Documents may be amended from time to time (i) to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or
inconsistency therein, (ii) to add to the Collateral, (iii) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer,
the Company or any Security Provider and the assumption of such successor of the obligations under the
Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security Documents, in each case, including in


-----

accordance with the terms under “—Merger and Consolidation,” and (iv) to evidence and provide for the
acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent, (e) the applicable Security Documents
may be amended from time to time in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders of the Notes in any
material respect (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) or as otherwise needed to comply with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (f) the Security Interests, and the related
Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or
released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), and
(g) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may enter into lease or rental agreements with respect to any
Collateral; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (a) and (f) above, the Security Documents may not be
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless
contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate
from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms
the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion
of Counsel, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new
hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event
that the Company, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary complies with the requirements of this covenant, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications and each of the
Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other modification or replacement without the need for
instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Notes Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, and subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility,
Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(a) of the second paragraph under the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or any Public Debt in an aggregate principal amount in excess of £15.0 million of the Issuer or a_
Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor within 30 Business Days of the date on
which the Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee
a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
provide a Notes Guarantee, which Notes Guarantee will be senior to or _pari passu, as applicable, with such_
Restricted Subsidiary’s Notes Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; _provided,_ _however, that such Restricted_
Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of
such Notes Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach
or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin
capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules, retention of title claims or the
laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the
officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such
Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of
the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any
Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain
limitations on guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law (including any usury laws).

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Notes
_Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release.” A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the_
option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which
was Incurred after the Issue Date or, with respect to the Target and its Subsidiaries, the Completion Date and
which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such
Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take
all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any


-----

Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by the Company to effect any release of a Notes
Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of
each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes and Our Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability” and “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests_
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of (x) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as otherwise required
herein and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the
Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders
of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional
**Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor**
Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable
to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of Notes
Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; _provided_ that (1) such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, protections, indemnifications,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement and (2) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at
any one time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error
or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types (including new Credit Facilities) of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment
to the Notes or Permitted Collateral Liens on the Collateral that rank junior to the Liens on the Collateral securing
the Notes and Notes Guarantees) or to allow a Permitted Lien as contemplated by the proviso in the definition of
Collateral, (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) to facilitate a Permitted Reorganization,
(6) make provision for equal and ratable Liens on the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (7) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof or (9) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely
affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to ensure that the
Notes and the Notes Guarantees are secured by senior ranking Liens over the Collateral. The Issuer shall not
otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers,”
and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, protections, indemnifications
or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to
the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any
obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein)
and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for
inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the Issuer’s offices or
at the offices of the listing agent.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may
be amended or otherwise contain customary provisions to include junior debt, second lien debt or Subordinated
Indebtedness similar to those contained in the Loan Market Association’s form Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Company_

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to,
any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) (if not the Company) will be a
Person organized or incorporated and existing under the laws of Jersey, any member state of the European
Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Canada or the United States of America, any State
of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will
expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the
Notes and (b) all obligations of the Company under the Proceeds Loan, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Company or the Successor Company
(as the case may be) would be able to Incur at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) either the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than, or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio would be
no greater than, it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with the Indenture, and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement, enforceable
against the Successor Company (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as
to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company which properties
and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Company, on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Company under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor
company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person,
unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) (if not the Issuer) will be a Person
organized or incorporated and existing under the laws of Jersey, any member state of the European Union,


-----

the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Canada or the United States of America, any State of the
United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly
assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes and (b) all
obligations of the Issuer under the Proceeds Loan, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such transaction
as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(3) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with the Indenture, and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement, enforceable
against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee);
_provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any_
matters of fact.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this “—
_Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer” covenant) shall not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary as a_
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer.

_The Subsidiary Guarantors_

None of the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose Notes Guarantee is to be
released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the
surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it

unless:

(A) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor (or the
Issuer) or becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor; or

(B) (1) either (x) the Issuer or a Guarantor (including any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Guarantor in
connection with such transaction) or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes
all of the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant
to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and
all obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which it is a party; and (2) immediately after
giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a
Subsidiary Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Subsidiary
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise not prohibited
by the Indenture.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or assigning, transferring, leasing or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor; (ii) any
Subsidiary Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or assigning, transferring, leasing or otherwise disposing


-----

of all or part of its properties and assets to the Company, the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation
or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or
consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and
(3) under the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating
into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such
entity; and (v) any Restricted Subsidiary or the Company from transferring land and other assets to a Project
Development Vehicle to the extent those assets relate to a project or development to be undertaken by such Project
Development Vehicle; provided, however, that clauses (1) and (4) under the heading the “—The Company” or
clauses (1) and (3) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clause (B) under the heading “—The Subsidiary
_Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction._

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this “—
_Merger and Consolidation—The Company” covenant) shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a_
Restricted Subsidiary.

For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything in this “—Merger and Consolidation”
covenant, this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to) any assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and/or its
Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to one or more operating leases or rental agreements.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may implement a Permitted Reorganization.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of, or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in
connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment, Incurrence, Change of Control,
acquisition of, or improvement to, any real property or other similar transaction where there is a time difference
between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness, Restricted
Payments, Change of Control and Investments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any
Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Company, be the date the definitive agreements (including
any commitment letter subject to full documentation) for such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture,
investment, Incurrence, Change of Control, real property acquisition, divestiture or improvement or similar
transaction are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment, Incurrence, Change of Control or similar
transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Restricted
Payment, Permitted Investment, Asset Disposition, Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof)
as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to
consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For
the avoidance of doubt, (1) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded or unsatisfied as a result of fluctuations
in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Total Assets, Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Total
Net Indebtedness, Senior Secured Indebtedness or Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company or the target
company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction,
such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or unsatisfied as a result of such fluctuations
solely for purposes of determining whether the transactions are permitted hereunder; and (2) such baskets or ratios
shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related transactions; provided _further that_
if the Company elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement
(including any commitment letter subject to full documentation), any such transactions (including any Restricted
Payment, Permitted Investment, Asset Disposition, Change of Control or Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use
of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such
agreement and before the consummation of such transactions.

When calculating an Applicable Metric based upon Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA
should be measured on the basis of the Relevant Testing Period.


-----

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical
**permission”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets (the “grower permission”) and the**
grower permission of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time, the
numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached
from time to time as a result of any such acquisitions and/or investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as
a result of any decrease in the grower permission.

If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred or issued, any Lien is
committed or incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a
ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio based Applicable Metric, such ratios shall be
calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any Indebtedness to finance the working capital needs of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee
facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under any Revolving Facility) and, for the
avoidance of doubt, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility) shall be
disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

For purposes of any determination or calculation to be made under the Indenture, the Company may use
financial statements of a predecessor of the Company or Keystone Midco Limited for reporting or making
calculations with respect to periods commencing prior to the Completion Date.

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (1) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is
incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under
a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or
a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following
headings (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

        - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

        - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

        - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

        - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

        - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

        - “—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”;

        - “—Additional Notes Guarantees”; and

        - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger and Consolidation—The
_Company”;_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable
to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will
thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be applicable
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to


-----

determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment
Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Notes
maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind
shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Notes Guarantees with respect to the Suspended
Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with
respect to such Suspended Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or
any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless
of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in
effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion
Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have
been classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” On
and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens
pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to
be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the
covenants described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and
prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension
Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction_
entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be
deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the
second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability
of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “—
_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the_
Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under
clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted
_Subsidiaries.” On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted_
to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long
as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

In addition, any future obligation to grant further Notes Guarantees shall be released. Subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, all obligations to grant Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment
Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions
under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for suspension of the
covenants to be effective.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days (or, in the case of an obligation set out in
“—Certain Covenants—Reports,” 120 days) after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders
or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any
agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(4) the occurrence of a default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued
or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company
or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would


-----

constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or
Non-Recourse Project Development Debt whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is
created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment
**default”); or**

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross
**acceleration provision”),**

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated final
maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates £30.0 million, or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary
(or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)
(the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company or a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
£30.0 million other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued
by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and
unstayed for a period of more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding
paragraph) after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance,
an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which
is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral with an aggregate
fair market value of the greater of £28.0 and 4.0% of Total Assets for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents or any such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared
invalid or unenforceable or the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any
such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 30 days (the
“security default provision”); and

(8) any Notes Guarantee of the Company or of a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of
Guarantors that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) ceases to be in full
force and effect, other than in accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any Notes
Guarantee limitations and the Agreed Security Principles (the “guarantee default provision”)).

Notwithstanding any other term of this “Description of the Notes” or the Indenture, no Permitted Reorganization
shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in, a breach of any undertaking or other term in this “Description
_of the Notes” or the Indenture, or a Default or an Event of Default, and shall be expressly permitted under the_
terms of this “Description of the Notes” or the Indenture. However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of this
paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the Default.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee, by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the


-----

outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may, and the Trustee (subject to certain
conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an
Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration
of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the Event of Default or payment default triggering
such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in
each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and
may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive
all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal or interest
which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default
is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any
Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—
_Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of_
the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such
notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or
security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce
the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to
the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole
discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and
the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.


-----

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in
the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or
the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled
to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities
and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in
writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days
after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if
any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines
that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous
year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of
any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is
taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). To the extent more than
one series of Notes is outstanding as contemplated under “—Additional Notes,” if any amendment, supplement or
waiver will only affect one or more series of Notes (but not all series of Notes), only the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of the series so affected (and not the consent
of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding), shall be required.
However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (7) or (9) below,
75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to
any Notes (provided, however, that if any amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will
only affect one or more series of Notes (but not all series of Notes), only the consent of the holders of at least 90%
(or, in the case of clause (7) or (9) below, 75%) of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
of the series so affected will be required) held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of, or extend the Stated Maturity of, any such Note (other than provisions relating
to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such
Note may be redeemed, in each case, as described above under “—Optional Redemption” or “—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;_

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates thereof;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes
in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an
exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable
Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
(taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor


-----

Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture; provided that for the
avoidance of doubt, the release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit
of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders
of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted
from such acceleration);

(9) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from any of their obligations under their Notes
Guarantees or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of holders of the
Notes to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, or to conform any provision to this
“Description of the Notes”;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a Permitted
Reorganization;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or make
any change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any Notes) that does not
adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Company) for the issuance of
Additional Notes that may be issued in compliance with the Indenture;

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Notes Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or_
for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of
any Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this
“Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(9) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant to the


-----

requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee, Security Agent or other agent to any
Notes Document;

(10) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledged, charge, hypothecate or grant a Security
Interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit
Facility, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility
(as in effect on the Completion Date) to be mortgaged, pledged, charged or hypothecated, or in which a
Security Interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; _provided that the granting of such_
Security Interest is not prohibited by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”
is complied with;

(11) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes
as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Notes; provided,
_however, that (a) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being_
transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (b) such
amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect;

(12) to facilitate a Permitted Reorganization or any transaction that complies with the covenants described
under the headings “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and/or “Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of_
assets;

(13) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”; or

(14) to release funds from the Escrow Account as provided for in the Escrow Agreement or the Indenture.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely
on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given
in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. The Indenture
shall not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clauses (4), (7) or (12) of the second paragraph of this section “Amendments and Waivers” to add a
Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the
accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional
Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized
and executed by the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent (to the extent applicable).

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes
Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate
(other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Company” and clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the covenant described under “—Certain_
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions_
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon
a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the


-----

Issuer), the judgment default provision, the guarantee default provision and the security default provision
described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes
may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default specified in clause (3) (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Company” and clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the covenant described under “—Certain_
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (other than with respect to the Issuer), (6), (7) or_
(8) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
**trust”) with the Trustee cash in pounds sterling or pounds sterling-denominated UK Government Obligations or**
a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with the delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that beneficial
owners of the Notes, will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts
and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance
had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a
ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since
the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating
to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly
provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and
payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited
with the Trustee, money in pounds sterling or pounds sterling-denominated UK Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the
Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the
date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption
date, as the case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium,
the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited
with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated on the date of the notice of redemption, with any
deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption, and any deficit shall
be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such deficit that
confirms that such deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all
other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under
the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption
date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the
Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any
such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the
foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)). If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and Principal Paying


-----

Agent (which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the above referenced
Officer’s Certificate) no later than five (5) Business Days prior to such distribution, the Trustee shall distribute
any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. For the
avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth
above shall not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break cost or any additional premium on
such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a global note deposited with a depositary for a clearing
system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding interests as a participant of such clearing system shall be
subject to the then applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under
the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture
will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties
as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person
would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of
the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer
and its Affiliate, including the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may resign or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the
Company and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the
Senior Secured Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months may petition
any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes
and expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely and conclusively
on any Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel in formulating its opinion or in taking any action (including,
without limitation, release of a Guarantee or Collateral) under the Indenture and may rely on such Officer’s
Certificate and Opinion of Counsel without the need for investigation or verification.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that
the rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Company with respect to the Notes will be sent to the Authority.

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Notes
are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream in accordance
with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the
requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests.


-----

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; _provided that, if notices are_
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after
being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class
mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time
prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency
with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly
given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given in via Euroclear or
Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal or Additional Amounts, if any,
on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the
Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable
due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Pound Sterling-Denominated Restrictions**

The pound sterling is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and
the Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, if any, including damages.
Any amount received or recovered in any other currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment
or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise
by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor
will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the pound sterling
amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on
the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date
on which it is practicable to do so).

If that pound sterling amount is less than the pound sterling amount expressed to be due to the recipient
or the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by
such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient
or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this
currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note
or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information
used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent
cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than
a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment,
order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Notes Guarantee,
or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
sterling-denominated restriction herein, the Sterling Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated
in a non-sterling currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such non-sterling amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be
granted to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application
to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in Notes thereon
will be granted, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries are located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer, the Company or the other Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any
redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

long as such Person does not have the right to direct the voting of the Voting Stock subject to such right) will not
cause a party to be a beneficial owner and (5) any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the beneficial
owner shall not be included in any Voting Stock of which any other person or group is the beneficial owner, unless
that person or group is not an Affiliate of a Permitted Holder and has greater voting power with respect to that

that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and disposed, ceased or discontinued operations that have been made by
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or subsequent to the reference
period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date shall be
calculated on a _pro forma_ basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,
amalgamations, consolidations and disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed
charge obligations and the change in Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of
the reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since
the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this
definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving _pro forma_ effect thereto for such
period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed, ceased or
discontinued operations had occurred at the beginning of the reference period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Company
(and may include cost savings, expense reductions and synergies reasonably expected to occur, including from
the result of a disposition or ceased or discontinued operations, as though such cost savings, expense reduction
and synergies had been achieved on the first day of the relevant four-quarter reference period). If any Indebtedness
bears a floating rate of interest and is being given _pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be_
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable
rate for the entire reference period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness).
Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by
a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized
Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on
any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon
the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the reference period except to the extent such revolving
credit facility has been permanently repaid and the commitments thereunder cancelled. Interest on Indebtedness
that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency
interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if
none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate.

All Applicable Metrics described in this definition will be calculated as set forth in the section “Financial
Calculations” above.

be used. In no case for any purposes in the Indenture shall the Gilt Rate be less than 0.00%.

footnotes thereto) of such Person prepared in accordance with IFRS; _provided that Indebtedness of any Parent_
Entity appearing upon the balance sheet of the Company prepared on the basis of IFRS shall be excluded.

The amount of Indebtedness of any Person at any time in the case of a revolving credit or similar facility

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more
global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes”). The
Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Notes sold within the United States to QIBs pursuant to Rule 144A will initially be represented by one
or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes,” and
together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited,
on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary
for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests,” and together
with the 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests
will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by
Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions
set out in the Indenture governing the Notes and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States
or any other jurisdiction. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of
£100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and Clearstream will
credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems the account of a participant with the interest
beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United
States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form.
The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or charge Book-Entry Interests. In addition,
while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Notes registered in their
names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered
owners or “holders” of the Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable (or their respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through
which they own Book-Entry Interests, in order to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under
the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar under
the Indenture or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records
relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Notes in definitive
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

      - if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

      - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream or the Issuer, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes
will bear the restrictive legend referred to in “Notice to Investors,” unless that legend is not required by the
Indenture or applicable law.


-----

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a
period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date
fixed for redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, the
Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption. In the event of the
transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. The Issuer may require a holder
to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that any such Definitive Registered
Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if any such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is
surrendered to the Registrar, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or its appointed agent) will authenticate a
replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the
Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond
sufficient in the judgment of both to protect the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the
Principal Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a
Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer and the Trustee may charge for any expenses incurred by them
in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem
or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first delivers to
the Registrar or the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees), as applicable, will distribute the same amount received by it in respect of the Global Note
so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in
respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption
of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under
existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time,
Euroclear and Clearstream will credit the accounts of participants on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to
prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry
Interest of less than £100,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest, and additional amounts, if any) to the Principal Paying Agent. The Principal Paying
Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will
distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective customary procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holders of the Global
Notes (i.e., Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees) as the owners thereof for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying
Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or
liability for:

      - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made
by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

      - any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant
or indirect participant; or


-----

      - the common depositary, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered
in “street name.”

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes, will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in pound sterling.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations
of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent,
the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other
person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or
rounding effected in connection with any such payment.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as
to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. Nevertheless, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form and to
distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which
require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in
the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with
the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.” Transfers of
144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of 144A Book-Entry Interests will at all times be
subject to such transfer restrictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being
made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the US Securities Act or any other exemption (if
available under the US Securities Act).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest
in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest
in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor
first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”


-----

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.
The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of
investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and
may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent,
the Transfer Agent nor the Registrar is responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

As Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions
require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to
transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Note only
through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the
ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they
are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility for the performance by
Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants, or indirect participants, of their respective obligations
under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in pound sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement
date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where the accounts of both the purchaser and the seller are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business.


-----

In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. US investors who wish
to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day
may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is
used, or Brussels if Euroclear is used.


-----

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making an offer, resale, pledge or other transfer or any
of the Notes offered hereby.

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees (together, the “Securities”) have not been, and will not be,
registered under the US Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered,
may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the US Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Securities offered
hereby or are being offered and sold inside the United States only to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the US
Securities Act and outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the US
Securities Act.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented
to and agreed with US and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) it is purchasing the Securities for its own account or for an account with respect to which it exercises sole
investment discretion and that it and any such account is either (A) a QIB, and is aware that the sale to it
is being made in reliance on Rule 144A or (B) outside the United States;

(2) it acknowledges that the Securities are being offered for resale in a transaction not involving a public
offering in the United States (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and have not been registered
under the Securities Act or any other securities laws and may not be reoffered, resold, pledged or
otherwise transferred within the United States;

(3) it shall not offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer the Securities except (A) to the Issuer or any of its
subsidiaries, (B) inside the United States to a QIB in a transaction complying with Rule 144A, (C) outside
the United States in an offshore transaction in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act,
(D) pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (if available), (E)
in accordance with another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or (F)
pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act. It acknowledges that no representation is
made as to the availability of the exemption provided by Rule 144A for resale of the Securities;

(4) it agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Securities notice of any restrictions on
transfer of such Securities;

(5) it is relying solely on the information contained in this offering memorandum in making its investment
decision with respect to the Securities. It acknowledges that neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have
made any representation to it with respect to us or the offering or sale of any Securities, other than the
information contained in this offering memorandum which has been delivered to it and upon which it is
relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Securities. It has had access to such financial
and other information concerning us and the Securities as it has deemed necessary in connection with its
decision to purchase the Securities, including an opportunity to ask questions of and request information
from us and the Initial Purchasers;

(6) it acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of Securities in certificated form or of beneficial
interests in a Global Note (in each case other than pursuant to an effective registration statement), the
holder of Securities or the holder of beneficial interests in a Global Note, as the case may be, may be
required to provide certifications and other documentation relating to the manner of such transfer and
submit such certifications and other documentation as provided in the Indenture;

(7) it understands that all of the Securities will bear a legend to the following effect unless otherwise agreed
by us and the holder thereof:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “US **SECURITIES ACT”) OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF**
ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY INTEREST OR
PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED,
ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION
OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE US SECURITIES ACT.


-----

THE HOLDER OF THIS NOTE BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF (1) REPRESENTS THAT (A) IT
IS A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE US
SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”)) (“QIB”) OR (B) IT IS ACQUIRING THIS NOTE IN AN
“OFFSHORE TRANSACTION” PURSUANT TO RULE 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER THE US
SECURITIES ACT (“REGULATION S”), AGREES ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF
ANY INVESTOR FOR WHICH IT HAS PURCHASED NOTES TO OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFER SUCH NOTES, ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER, THE GUARANTORS OR ANY
SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, (B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH HAS
BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE US SECURITIES ACT, (C) FOR SO LONG AS THE
NOTES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE 144A, TO A PERSON IT
REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QIB THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR
THE ACCOUNT OF A QIB TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING
MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A, (D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT OCCUR
OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE MEANING OF REGULATION S OR (E)
PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE US SECURITIES ACT, AND (3) AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO
EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS NOTE IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO
THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND; SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER’S AND THE TRUSTEE’S RIGHTS
PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER (I) PURSUANT TO CLAUSE (D) OR (E),
TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR
OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO EACH OF THEM AND (II) IN EACH OF THE
FOREGOING CASES, TO REQUIRE THAT A CERTIFICATE OF TRANSFER IN THE FORM
APPEARING ON THE REVERSE OF THIS NOTE IS COMPLETED AND DELIVERED BY THE
TRANSFEROR TO THE TRANSFER AGENT. THE HOLDER OF THIS NOTE AGREES THAT IT
WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS NOTE IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE
SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS
“OFFSHORE TRANSACTION” AND “UNITED STATES” HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO
THEM BY REGULATION S.

A purchaser of the Notes will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to
holders of beneficial interests in such Notes as well as to holders of such Notes.

(8) It agrees it is not nor is it acting for the account of a retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article
4(1) of MiFID II, (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II
or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation, and it further understands that no
key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering, selling or distributing the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore
offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

(9) It agrees it is not nor is it acting for the account of a retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA, (ii) a customer within
the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus
Regulation and it further understands that no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs
Regulation for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation.

(10) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on
transfer of such Notes.


-----

(11) It acknowledges that the Transfer Agent will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any
Notes except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the Trustee that the restrictions set out
therein have been complied with.

(12) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth
and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees
that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been
made by its purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it will promptly notify the Initial Purchasers.
If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it
has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to
make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor
account.

(13) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the Issuer
or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation
or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us, the Company and its
subsidiaries or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any
transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set out under “Plan of Distribution” and
“Notice to Investors.”

(14) It acknowledges that the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its
purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it will promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is
acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has
sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make
the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor
account.

(15) It agrees to indemnify and hold us, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the
Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates harmless from and against any cost, damage or loss
incurred by any of them as a result of any of the foregoing representations and agreements being or
becoming false;

(16) It acknowledges any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth in this
Offering Memorandum, including those listed in the sections “Important Information” and “Plan of
_Distribution”; and_

(17) It acknowledges that any purported acquisition or transfer of the Securities or beneficial interest therein
to an acquirer or transferee that does not comply with the requirements of the above provisions shall be
null and void ab initio.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain UK Taxation Considerations**

_The following is a summary of the United Kingdom withholding taxation treatment and of certain other_
_United Kingdom taxation issues at the date hereof in relation to payments of principal and interest in respect of_
_the Notes. It is based on current law and published practice of HMRC, which may be subject to change, possibly_
_with retrospective effect. The comments relate only to the position of persons who are absolute beneficial owners_
_of the Notes, and some aspects do not apply to some classes of persons, such as dealers in securities. Prospective_
_holders of the Notes should be aware that the particular terms of issue of any series of Notes as specified in the_
_relevant terms of the Notes may affect the tax treatment of that and other series of Notes. The following is a general_
_guide for information purposes and should be treated with appropriate caution. It is not intended as tax advice_
_and it does not purport to describe all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a prospective purchaser_
_of Notes. Prospective holders of the Notes who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult their_
_professional advisers. Prospective holders of the Notes who may be liable to taxation in jurisdictions other than_
_the United Kingdom in respect of their acquisition, holding or disposal of the Notes are particularly advised to_
_consult their professional advisers as to whether they are so liable (and if so under the laws of which jurisdictions),_
_since the following comments relate only to certain United Kingdom taxation aspects of payments in respect of_
_the Notes. In particular, holders should be aware that they may be liable to taxation under the laws of other_
_jurisdictions in relation to payments in respect of the Notes even if such payments may be made without_
_withholding or deduction for or on account of taxation under the laws of the United Kingdom._

**_UK Withholding Tax on UK Source Interest_**

The Notes will constitute “quoted Eurobonds” provided they are and continue to be listed on a
“recognised stock exchange” within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the “ITA”). While
the Notes are and continue to be quoted Eurobonds, payments of interest on the Notes may be made without
withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax.

The Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for the purposes of section 1005 of the ITA. The Notes
will be treated as listed on the Exchange if they are both admitted to trading on the Exchange and officially listed
in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in European Economic Area states.

If the Notes are not listed on a “recognised stock exchange” or cease to be so listed, interest will generally
be paid by the Issuer under deduction of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%) subject to such relief as
may be available following a direction from HMRC pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation
treaty (a “Treaty”), or to any other exemption which may apply.

**_Payments by Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the
Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) such payments may be subject to UK
withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), subject to such relief as may be available under an applicable
Treaty, or to any other exemption which may apply. Such payments by a Guarantor may not be eligible for the
“quoted Eurobond” exemption described above.

In certain circumstances and subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer and Guarantors (as applicable) will
be obliged to gross-up payments on the Notes to ensure that the holders of the Notes receive and retain a net
payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding for or on
account of United Kingdom income tax been required. See “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.”

The provisions referred to above may also apply, in certain circumstances, to amounts paid on redemption
of the Notes if they constitute “deeply discounted securities” as defined in Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Income Tax
(Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 (“ITTOIA 2005”).

**_Other Rules Relating to United Kingdom Tax_**

(1) Where Notes are to be, or may fall to be, redeemed at a premium, as opposed to being issued at a discount,
then any such element of premium may constitute a payment of interest. Payments of interest are subject
to United Kingdom withholding tax as described above.


-----

(2) The references in this section (“Certain UK Taxation Considerations”) to “interest,” “premium” and
“discount” above are to “interest,” “premium” and “discount” as understood in United Kingdom tax law.
The statements above do not take any account of any different definitions of “interest,” “premium” and
“discount” which may prevail under any other law or which may be created by the terms and conditions
of the Notes or any related documentation. Holders of the Notes should seek their own professional
advice as regards the withholding tax treatment of any payment on the Notes which does not constitute
“interest,” “premium” and “discount” as those terms are understood in United Kingdom tax law.

(3) The above description of the United Kingdom withholding tax position assumes that there will be no
substitution of an issuer and does not consider the tax consequences of any such substitution.

**_Further United Kingdom Taxation Issues_**

Interest on the Notes constitutes United Kingdom source income for tax purposes and may be subject to
United Kingdom tax by way of direct assessment (including self-assessment) even where paid without
withholding or deduction. However, interest with a United Kingdom source received without withholding or
deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax will not be chargeable to United Kingdom tax on
income in the hands of a holder of Notes (other than certain trustees) who is not resident for tax purposes in the
United Kingdom unless (a) that holder of Notes is a company which carries on a trade in the United Kingdom
through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom or, if not such a company, carries on a trade, profession
or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency, and (b) the interest is received in connection with,
or the Notes are attributable to, that permanent establishment, branch or agency. There are exemptions for interest
received by certain categories of agent (such as some brokers and investment managers). The provisions of an
applicable double taxation treaty may also be relevant for such holders of the Notes.

**_United Kingdom Corporation Tax Payers_**

In general, holders of Notes which are within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax (including
non-resident holders whose Notes are used, held or acquired for the purpose of a trade carried on in the United
Kingdom through a permanent establishment) will be charged to tax as income on all returns, profits or gains on,
and fluctuations in value of, the Notes (whether attributable to currency fluctuations or otherwise) in accordance
with the “loan relationship” rules contained in Part 5 of the Corporation Tax Act 2009 on a basis broadly in
accordance with their statutory accounting treatment.

**_Other United Kingdom Tax Payers_**

_Taxation of Chargeable Gains_

If the Notes constitute “deeply discounted securities” for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of ITTOIA
2005 (as to which, please see “—Taxation of Discount” below), the Notes should also constitute “qualifying
corporate bonds” within the meaning of Section 117 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, with the result
that on a disposal of the Notes neither chargeable gains nor allowable losses should arise for the purposes of
United Kingdom taxation of capital gains. If Notes are not “deeply discounted securities,” they may fall outside
the definition of “qualifying corporate bond” mentioned above. Where the Notes do not constitute “qualifying
corporate bonds,” any disposal of such a Note by an individual holder who is resident for tax purposes in the
United Kingdom or who carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or
agency to which such a Note is attributable may give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss for the purposes
of United Kingdom tax on chargeable gains, depending on individual circumstances.

_Accrued Income Profits_

On a disposal of Notes by a holder of Notes, any interest which has accrued since the last interest payment
date or such amount as HMRC deems just and reasonable may be chargeable to tax as income under the rules
relating to accrued income profits as set out in Part 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 if that holder of Notes is
resident in the United Kingdom or carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a
branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable. These provisions will not apply if the Notes are deemed to
be “deeply discounted securities” (as to which, please see “—Taxation of Discount” below).

_Taxation of Discount_

Dependent, among other things, on the discount (if any) at which the Notes are issued, or, in certain
cases, the premium (if any) payable on redemption, the Notes may be deemed to constitute “deeply discounted


-----

securities” for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the ITTOIA 2005. If Notes are deemed to constitute deeply
discounted securities, individual holders of the Notes who are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or
who carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the
Notes are attributable generally will be liable to United Kingdom income tax on any gain realized on the sale or
other disposal (including redemption) of the Notes, however such holders will not be able to claim relief from
United Kingdom income tax in respect of costs incurred on the acquisition, transfer or redemption of, or losses
incurred on the transfer or redemption of, the Notes. Holders of Notes are advised to consult their own professional
advisers if they require any advice or further information relating to “deeply discounted securities.”

_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax_

No United Kingdom stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax will be payable on the issue or transfer of the
Notes.

**Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain US federal income tax considerations related to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.
This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a US holder (as defined below) except for Additional Notes
(as defined under “—Additional Notes”) and FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance
_Act”), and does not address the effects of any US federal tax laws other than US federal income tax laws (such as_
estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-US tax laws. This discussion is based upon the US Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury
**Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all**
of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the US Internal Revenue Service
(the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no
assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the US federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to
a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare
contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, US expatriates,
insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, US
holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real
estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities and investors in such entities, persons liable
for alternative minimum tax, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income
with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement, US holders that are resident
in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States and persons holding the Notes as
part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion
is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issuance and at their “issue price” (the first price
at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar
persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold
the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “US holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for US federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any
entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or
the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless
of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a US person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes holds the Notes,
the US tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partner and the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in
such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the US federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax**
**consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the**
**US federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of US federal estate and**


-----

**gift tax laws, the US federal Medicare tax on net investment income and state, local, non-US or other tax**
**laws.**

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, payments of stated interest on the Notes (including
any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld)
generally will be includible in the gross income of a US holder as ordinary interest income at the time the interest
is received or accrued, in accordance with such US holder’s method of accounting for US federal income tax
purposes.

A US holder that uses the cash method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes and that receives
a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the US dollar
value of the pound sterling interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is
received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to US dollars at such time. A cash method US
holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but
may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the pound sterling so received.

A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes (or who
otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income)
the US dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in pound sterling that has accrued with respect to its
Notes during an accrual period. The US dollar value of such pound sterling denominated accrued interest will be
determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect
to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within
each taxable year. An accrual basis US holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into
US dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual
period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively,
if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a US
holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of
exchange on the date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an
electing US holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by
the US holder, and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A US holder that uses the accrual method
of accounting for US federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued
interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal
the difference, if any, between the US dollar value of the pound sterling payment received (translated at the spot
rate of exchange on the date such interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the US dollar value of
the interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the
payment is in fact converted to US dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute
ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as US source income or loss, and generally
not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be
considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to US holders under US
federal income tax laws. Any non-US withholding tax paid (or deemed paid) by a US holder at the rate applicable
to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for US federal income
tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). The calculation of
foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a US holder’s particular
circumstances. US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such
disposition (less any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest
income as discussed above to the extent not previously included in income by the US holder) and such US holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A US holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such US holder.
The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the US dollar value of the foreign currency


-----

purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an
established securities market and the relevant US holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer
who has made the special election described below, such US holder will determine the US dollar value of the cost
of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase.

If a US holder receives foreign currency on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the US dollar value of such foreign currency
translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such taxable disposition. In the case of a Note that is
considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis US holder and, if it so elects, an accrual
basis US holder, will determine the US dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the
spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis US
holders in regards to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be
applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the US holder from year to year and cannot be changed without
the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis US holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date
and the settlement date.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of
a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such
Note generally will be US source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or
expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal to the difference, if any, between the US dollar value of the US
holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the US
holder disposes of the Note, and the US dollar value of the US holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the
Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the US holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the
sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder may recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest
which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder will recognize any foreign currency
exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss
realized by such US holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of a Note in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be US
source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate US holders (including
individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates
of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign
currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the
foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue additional notes (“Additional Notes”) as described under “Description of the
_Notes.” These Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the_
original Notes in some cases may be treated as a separate series for US federal income tax purposes. In such case,
the Additional Notes may be considered to have OID which may adversely affect the market value of the original
Notes if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the original Notes.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest on the Notes and
to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to certain
holders by US paying agents or other US intermediaries. In addition, backup withholding is required on such
payments made to a US holder through a US paying agent or other US intermediary unless the US holder furnishes
a correct taxpayer identification number (which for an individual is the Social Security Number) and certifies on
an IRS Form W-9, under penalties of perjury, that the US holder is not subject to backup withholding and
otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Holders should consult their
tax advisors regarding application of backup withholding in their particular circumstances and the availability of
and procedure for obtaining an exemption from backup withholding under current Treasury regulations.


-----

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a US holder’s US federal income tax liability provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise
to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in
respect of a foreign currency note. US holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return
disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS
Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

US holders who are individuals and who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value
in excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an
information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will
constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in
an account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual
for purposes of these rules.

US holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”) and
subject to the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold
US tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain
US source payments. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable
final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed with the US Federal Register generally would be
“grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign
financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of
the Notes for US federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. However, if
Additional Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period, have the same CUSIP or ISIN as the
original Notes issued hereby, and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all
the notes, including the Notes issued hereby, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Under proposed regulations,
any withholding on passthru payments on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru
payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of
applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed
regulations until final regulations are issued. Non-US governments have entered into agreements with the United
States (and additional non-US governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in
a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules
may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect
to any payments on the Notes, there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES**

**AND SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary description of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the_
_Notes Guarantees and the security interests for the Notes, and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations_
_in the jurisdiction in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated. The description is only a summary_
_and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the_
_validity and enforceability of the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the security interests. As such, prospective_
_investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**England and Wales**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of Collateral are companies incorporated under the laws of
England and Wales (the “English Obligors”).

**_Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of the English Courts_**

While the United Kingdom was a member state of the European Union, insolvency processes opened in
the United Kingdom were subject to both EU and applicable UK domestic legislation. Following the United
Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on January 31, 2020 and the expiry of the subsequent transition
period (the “Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in accordance with the EUWA as directly applicable in
the United Kingdom at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK
domestic law subject to significant amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI
2019/146) (as amended) effected key amendments to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in
the UK, including the Insolvency Regulation 2000 and the EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency
Proceedings (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), and domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act
1986 (the “Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2006 (SI 2016/1024) (the “Insolvency
**Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency**
**Regulations”).**

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the
Transition Period, in which case the unmodified Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency
legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligors would likely
proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant
proceedings. However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its centre of main interests (“COMI”) in a
member state of the European Union, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation
and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that
EU member state. In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may
have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of any English Obligor which has its COMI or an
“establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human
means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction.

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings
available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in
respect of any company which has its COMI in the United Kingdom or which has its COMI in an EU member
state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the United Kingdom. An “establishment” is defined to mean
any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the
request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.
While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain
insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent
of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions. See “—Cross-border Recognition
_of English Insolvency and Restructuring Proceedings.”_

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible
to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes are
guaranteed by the Notes Guarantees and secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws
and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the payment obligations of the Issuer in respect of the
principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer, of a Notes Guarantee against an English Obligor and of
the security interests over the Collateral.


-----

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such
limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights for
payment of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer, under the Notes Guarantees and/or under
the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors
may receive in an insolvency of an English Obligor.

**_Fixed Versus Floating Charges_**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees benefit from fixed and floating charge security over certain
Collateral owned by the English Obligors.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security.

Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to
floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed
of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge.

On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating
charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating
charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation
of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the
remuneration of insolvency officeholders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging
company while in administration) properly incurred in an insolvency process are generally payable out of the
assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge)
and insolvency officeholders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use
such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the
extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses
in full; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without
the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in
respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) where the floating charge
is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or
financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under
the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral
**Regulations”), assets subject to floating charge security are subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors**
and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors (see “—Priority on Insolvency”); and (e) there
are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to floating charge security.

There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that fixed security interests expressed to
be created by a security document governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the
description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will
be upheld as fixed security interests rather than recharacterized as floating security interests will depend, among
other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s ability
to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security
holder in practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported
fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the
security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed
charge.

**_Administration_**

English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of any
company within their general jurisdiction (see “—Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of the English
_Courts”), any company incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or a member state of the EEA, any company_
(irrespective of its country of incorporation) with its COMI in the United Kingdom or an EU member state (other
than Denmark) and upon request from courts in other parts of the United Kingdom or certain other countries and
territories. In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is
satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration
order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration.

A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as
they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the


-----

amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the
Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a
creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a
judgment debt (or similar court order).

The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing
the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s
creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably
practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property
to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any
distribution to creditors is set out below. See “—Priority on Insolvency.”

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, the debtor company, the directors of such company
or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as described in “—Qualifying Floating Charge”) where the
floating charge has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court. Different appointment
procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer.

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business as an agent of the company to which they
are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company
in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the
realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of
preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “—Prescribed Part”). An administrator may
also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the
property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from
the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder.

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration.
Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed such that no step may be taken to
enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or leave
of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same
requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal
proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a
court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of
statutory objectives of administration described above.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able
to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is
by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising
under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares,
bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

Accordingly, if any of the English Obligors were to enter into administration, the Notes, the Notes
Guarantees and the Collateral may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of the
administrator while the relevant company was in administration. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent
would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

**_Qualifying Floating Charge_**

If a company grants security constituting a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of
English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator out of court (see “—Administration”)
or (in limited circumstances) an administrative receiver (see “—Administrative Receivership”). The holder of a
qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to appoint
an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable,
administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors
over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the
company going into administration.

A floating charge constitutes a qualifying floating charge if it is created by an instrument which (a) states
that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator
of the company, or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning
given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such


-----

floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security granted to that party, relates to the
whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company, and at least one such security interest is
a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates
to ‘the whole or substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to
what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

**_Administrative Receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in very
limited circumstances. The ability to appoint an administrative receiver only applies to holders of a qualifying
floating charge where either the security document granting such charge pre-dates September 15, 2003 or where
it falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002). The most
relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to
“capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates
a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the
arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act and
includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court
(and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure)
and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the
security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an
undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge (see “—Transactions at an Undervalue,” “—Preference”
and “—Voidable Floating Charge,” respectively). If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver
will vacate office.

**_Fixed Charge Receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating
charges (see “—Administrative Receivership”)) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed
charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances)
pursuant to statute.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the
charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for
an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator
may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge
created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement,” as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial
Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration”).

The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning
(s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointer. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who
performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a
proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver
will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed
charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of
the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointer).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be
deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential
creditors (see “—Prescribed Part”).

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities
between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). An English Obligor may be able to pursue a
scheme in respect of its financial liabilities.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that


-----

such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If
a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s)
of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds
contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all
affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted
against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court
will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether
to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the
scheme.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not
automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Restructuring Plan_**

A restructuring plan is a procedure under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 which allows the English
courts to effect a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its
creditors). While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a
company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to
encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going
concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any
class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial
difficulties.

A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any
liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will
vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of
classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and
any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and
voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed compromise, there is no
requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting,
and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of the plan, provided that the
court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the restructuring
plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ and (b) the restructuring
plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic
interest in the company in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes of this
assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the
restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for
the possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or
more classes of affected creditors do not vote in favor of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of
one class of stakeholders to bind other classes.

Following approval of the restructuring plan at the meetings of creditors, the restructuring plan needs to
be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether each applicable statutory
condition has been satisfied and consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has
discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or reject the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected
stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning
the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies.

As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not
automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Liquidation/Winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see
“—Priority on Insolvency”). There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court;
and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the


-----

company’s members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in
question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the
company’s solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the compulsory winding-up
of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act – see
“—Administration”). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration)
is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree
of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are
available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the United Kingdom in addition to companies within the
English courts’ general jurisdiction (see “—Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of the English
_Courts”), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England,_
Wales or Scotland.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant
company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void.
However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise
arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent
a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an
order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the
presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings
against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the
company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no
freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no
equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary windingup – it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the
continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security.

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on
the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property
and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “—Avoidance
_of Transactions”)._

In light of the coronavirus pandemic, legislation has been introduced which temporarily restricts the
ability of creditors to present winding-up petitions and of courts to grant winding-up orders. While these measures
remain in place, (a) winding-up petitions on the basis of a company’s inability to satisfy a statutory demands alone
are void if the relevant statutory demands were served between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021, and (b)
where winding-up petitions are presented between April 27, 2020 and September 30, 2021 based on other grounds,
the petitioning creditor must show that it had reasonable grounds to believe that coronavirus has not had a financial
effect on the company or that the company’s inability to pay its debts would have arisen even if coronavirus had
not had such effect on the company. Between April 27, 2020 and September 30, 2021, a court may similarly only
grant a winding-up order in circumstances where a company is deemed unable to pay its debts and it appears to
the court that coronavirus has had a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition if the
court is satisfied that the company’s insolvency would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on
the company.

**_Priority on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going
concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company
in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors.

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different
classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order
of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally
cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in
full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that
is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.


-----

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration
are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory
insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in
respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the
administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by
the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

  - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets_
covers that indebtedness);

  - _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of_
priority in which expenses are paid);

  - _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in
relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of
employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per
person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination
takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for
compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit.
As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and
include claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student
loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but
excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of
employees and customers as well as bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under
the FSCS to the extent such claims exceed the statutory limit. As between one another, secondary
preferential debts rank equally;

  - _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would_
include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which,
on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset
realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to
certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

  - _Fifth ranking:_

`o` firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall)
secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the
date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any
unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets
as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the
Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

`o` secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and
the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in
respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an
administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the
case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest
due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets,
be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

`o` thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories
above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully
repaid; and


-----

  - _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds_
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

**_Prescribed Part_**

An insolvency practitioner of a company (e.g. an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator)
will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge
security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses
out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000
of the company’s net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over £10,000, with a
maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to
the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate
cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so
would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

**_Avoidance of Transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and/or guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into
administration or liquidation within a specified period after the granting of the security and/or guarantee.
Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the
administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company.

The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as
described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in
respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

_Onset of Insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and
invalid floating charges (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or
(c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the
onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it
is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the
onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration.

_Connected Persons_

If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of
transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the
company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the
relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband,
wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the
individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that
company. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a
person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have
control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist
of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a
member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.


-----

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another
company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or
instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any
general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons
together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest
or guarantee granted by the English Obligors include, without limitation, the following described below:

_Transactions at an Undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set
aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) where the creation of such security
interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue.

A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a
consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as
defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the company’s
insolvency is within a period of two years from the date the company grants the security interest or the guarantee.
In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts
unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see “—Connected Persons”), in which case there
is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to
pay its debts at the time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction.

A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person,
if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in
money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court shall not make an
order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying
on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would
benefit it.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such
order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the
transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An
order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose an obligation on, any
person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order
will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith
and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received
a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the
company, except where the person was a party to the transaction.

_Preferences_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set
aside payments, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) where such payment,
creation of security interest or guarantee constituted a preference.

A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the
transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123
of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into insolvency within a period
of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the
beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being
the company’s employee) from the date the company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction
may constitute a preference if a transaction has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or
guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into
insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction
not been entered into. However, a court shall not make an order unless the company which entered into the
transaction was influenced by a desire to produce a preferential position in relation to that person when taking
their decision.


-----

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay
its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the
beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by
reason only of being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a
better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the
company to prefer them.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit
to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may
include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a
preference may affect the property of, or impose an obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person
to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired
from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an
interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to
pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a
preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company.

_Transactions Defrauding Creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where a transaction was at an undervalue and the court is satisfied that it
was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make,
a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the
claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction
defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction
including the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the
company is in liquidation or administration) and use of the provision is therefore not limited to liquidators or
administrators. There is no statutory time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal
statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result
of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make
such order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered
into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under
or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose an
obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However,
such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor
company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person
who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant
circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to
the transaction.

_Voidable Floating Charges_

Under English insolvency law, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year prior
to the onset of the company’s insolvency (or two years in the case of a floating charge in favor of a connected
person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to do so as a consequence of
the transaction will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to; (b) the goods or services
supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the
creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for a company to be
unable to pay its debts at the time of granting the floating charge or to become insolvent as a consequence of doing
so does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that
a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is
automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration.

However, if the floating charge is created or otherwise arising under a “security financial collateral
arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as
described in “Administration” above.


-----

_Recharacterization of Fixed Charges_

As referred to above (see “—Fixed Versus Floating Charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being
recharacterized as a floating charge. If such recharacterization falls within the suspect period referred to above
(see “—Voidable Floating Charges”), this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the Consideration.

_Disclaimer_

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or
other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or
perform any other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be
unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company
that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially
disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power
to disclaim onerous property does not apply to an executed contract nor can it, except so far as is necessary for
the purpose of releasing the company from any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. Any
person suffering loss or damage in consequence of the operation of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of
the company and may prove for the loss or damage in the winding up.

**_Security over Shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English Obligor or over shares of an English Obligor are, under
English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a charging company creates
an encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the charging company retains legal title to the shares.
Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the
discretion of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares
may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances)
the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under
English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.

**_Security over Bank Accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by an English
Obligor, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may have reserved
their right at any time to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling
or other arrangements with that English Obligor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is
merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to
the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under
the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it
would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English Obligor)
and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant
Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such
circumstances.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

_Constitutional Documents, Corporate Benefit and Financial Assistance_

The grant of a Notes Guarantee or Collateral by any of the English Obligors in respect of the obligations
of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. Among other requirements, such a transaction
must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these
documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security
can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for
third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not
without difficulties in its interpretation.

Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its
entry into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a
way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit
of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial


-----

benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to
being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain
circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the
statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that
the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to
become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable.”

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to
the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

_Security Registration_

Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document
pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security
governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be
delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant
security interest (the “Registration Period”). While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as
such on English companies to register security, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator,
administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the Registration Period.
When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become
immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to
rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the Registration Period has expired.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration
with the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales
similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable
asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

_Moratoriums_

As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the
automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are
unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security
or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “—
_Administration”), moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “—Liquidation/Winding-_
_up”)._

_Restriction on the Operation and Exercise of Ipso Facto Provisions_

Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto
clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing
insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts
which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic
termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an
insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into
a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary
arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be
unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant officeholder consents to the
termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would
cause the supplier hardship.

The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in
the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees,
contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of,
arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act).

**_Cross-border Recognition of English Insolvency and Restructuring Proceedings_**

_General Position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed
by applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and


-----

judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable
in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency
(the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and the
United Kingdom, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law
provides for recognition of certain UK insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main
proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the United Kingdom) or foreign non-main
proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the
United Kingdom) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the
recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the foreign
jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in the UK
of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the
jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a
jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations only
provide for recognition of proceedings under British insolvency law, which in relation to England and Wales
covers proceedings initiated under the Insolvency Act other than receivership proceedings and members’
voluntary liquidations, and does not extend to restructuring processes governed by corporate law such as schemes
of arrangement and restructuring plan processes.

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which
are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the
jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention
on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 and the Lugano Convention 2007 (subject to the United Kingdom’s pending
accession to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private
international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June
2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing
area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters
relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague
Convention and the Lugano Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring
proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties.

_Recognition in the European Union_

Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union and the expiry of the Transition
Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As
the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom do not include a
replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the European Union
(and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the United Kingdom
and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic
for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders
to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and
recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the
need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in
cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than
COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. To the
extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative
basis for recognition in EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU
member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the United Kingdom
was a member state of the European Union. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent
proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may adversely affected as a result.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Initial Purchasers are Credit Suisse International, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC and Goldman Sachs
International. Subject to the terms set forth in the purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), the Issuer
has agreed to sell, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase, the entire principal amount of the Notes
offered hereby from the Issuer.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the
cover of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may change the prices at which the Notes are offered
and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through
certain of their affiliates, who are qualified broker dealers under applicable law, including in respect of sales into
the United States.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel
and our counsel.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Company and its subsidiaries will indemnify and hold
harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the US Securities Act, and will
contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer has
agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof through and including
the date that is 60 days after the date the Notes are issued, to not, and to cause its subsidiaries to not, without
having received the prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that have
a tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes and the Notes Guarantees).

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act and may not be offered
or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S. Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the acknowledgements, representations,
warranties and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.” In addition, an offer or sale of Notes within
the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or
another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings
given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Investors.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

      - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to
be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer;

      - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom;

      - has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make
available any Securities to any retail investor (within the meaning of Article 4(1) of MiFID II)
in the European Economic Area; and

      - has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make
available any Securities to any retail investor (within the meaning of point (8) of Article 2 of
the EUWA) in the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by
the Issuer, its subsidiaries or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us, the
Company and its subsidiaries or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.
Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum


-----

nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published,
in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such
country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer
to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession
this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating
to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time solicit offers for, or offer
or sell, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause
the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the US Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and
Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made
to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List in accordance with the
rules of the Authority; however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such
listing will be maintained.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as
permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obliged, however, to make a market in the Notes, and
any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without
notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the US Securities
Act and the US Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop,
that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price
which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure—There may
_not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

The Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in overallotment, stabilizing
transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial
Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing
bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market
after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Stabilizing
Manager to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or
dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. The Stabilizing Manager is
not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can
be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes
_and Our Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell_
_the Notes may be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or
after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if
commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are
commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days
after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or
otherwise.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be      business days (as such term is
used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the US Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this
settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the US Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum
or on the next           successive business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at
the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades
should consult their own advisors.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates may engage in brokerage activities, may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade
debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for
their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve


-----

securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If one or more Initial Purchaser or their affiliates have a lending
relationship with us or our affiliates, they may routinely hedge their credit exposure to us or our affiliates in a
manner consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchaser and their
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby.
Any such positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchaser
and its affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views
in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire,
long and short positions in such securities and instruments.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are lenders under the Existing Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Term Facility, which will be repaid with the net proceeds of the Offering.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are acting as mandated arrangers, lenders and/or agents under
the Revolving Credit Facility and certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are acting as arrangers, lenders
and/or agents under the committed bridge facility financing that we have entered into to provide financing for the
Acquisition in the event the Offering is not consummated, and in connection therewith such entities will receive
customary fees and commissions. Additionally, the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates have historically
provided, and may in the future provide, certain investment and commercial banking services to us and our
affiliates (including hedging, customary overdraft facilities, charge cards and hire purchase financings) and have
performed, and may perform, other services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which
they have received, or may receive, customary advisory and transaction fees, commissions and expense
reimbursement. Moreover, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are or may become
parties to certain of our hedging arrangements, following the closing of the Offering.


-----

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and the
Guarantors are entities incorporated or established under the laws of England and Wales. The majority of the
Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ managing directors, executive board members, supervisory board members, directors,
officers and other executives are expected to be neither residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore,
the majority of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may
not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons, the Issuer or
the Guarantors or to enforce judgments of US courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of US federal
or state securities laws against such persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors despite the fact that, pursuant to the
terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors have appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of
process in New York.

**England and Wales**

The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.

A final and conclusive judgment for a debt or definite sum of money issued by a federal or state court in
the United States may (subject to the conditions below) be enforced at common law in England and Wales
provided that the party against whom the judgment was given properly submitted to the jurisdiction of the relevant
courts in accordance with English rules on the conflict of laws. In order to enforce any such US judgment in
England or Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England or Wales.
In such an action, the court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the US
court (subject to what is stated below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a
claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). However, an English or Welsh court may decline to enforce
a US judgment where:

      - the US judgment was procured by fraud;

      - the US judgment was given contrary to the English rules of natural or substantial justice, for
example the defendant was not given due notice of the original proceedings or was not given an
adequate opportunity to be heard in the original proceedings, or the defendant did not have the
opportunity to correct procedural irregularities under the laws of the court giving judgment;

      - recognition of the US judgment would be contrary to English public policy;

      - recognition of the US judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998;

      - the US judgment conflicts with an earlier English judgment, or foreign judgment that is
enforceable in an English court;

      - the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration
agreement or a contractual choice of court agreement or where recognition or enforcement of
the judgment would be contrary to the terms of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982;

      - enforcement of the US judgment would involve the enforcement of foreign taxes, fines or
penalties (which involves payment to the State as distinct from an individual) or revenue or
other public law;

      - enforcement of the US judgment would contravene Section 5 of the Protection of Trading
Interests Act 1980, which precludes, among other things, the enforcement by any court in the
United Kingdom of any judgment given by a court of an overseas country which is a judgment
for multiple damages which exceed the compensatory element of the judgment award; or

      - enforcement of the US judgment is time-barred or outside any relevant limitation periods.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from US federal or state courts. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you
that those judgments will be enforceable in England and Wales.

**LEGAL MATTERS**

Certain legal matters in connection with the Offering will be passed upon for the Issuer and the
Guarantors by Latham & Watkins (London) LLP, as to matters of US federal, New York state and English law.
Certain legal matters in connection with the Offering will be passed upon for the Initial Purchasers by Cahill
Gordon & Reindel (UK) LLP, as to matters of US federal, New York state and English law.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR**

The consolidated financial statements of the KM Group: (i) as of and for the financial year ended October
31, 2019 and 2020; (ii) as of and for the seven months ended October 31, 2018; and (iii) as of and for the financial
year ended March 31, 2018 (each prepared in accordance with IFRS), included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum, have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent auditor, as stated in their reports
appearing herein. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is registered to carry out audit work in the United Kingdom by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales,
the independent auditor’s report included in (i) the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the
financial years ended October 31, 2019, and 2020; (ii) the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for
the seven months ended October 31, 2018; and (iii) the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the
financial year ended March 31, 2018 each state that they were prepared for and only for the members of Keystone
Midco Limited as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act of 2006 and for no other
purpose; and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the independent auditor does not accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to anyone other than Keystone Midco Limited and its members as a body
for its audit work or the opinions it has formed, save where expressly agreed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s
prior consent in writing.

The independent auditor’s reports for the KM Group (i) for the financial years ended October 31, 2019,
and 2020; (ii) for the seven months ended October 31, 2018; and (iii) for the financial year ended March 31, 2018,
were each unqualified. The independent auditor’s reports for the KM Group for the financial years ended October
31, 2020 and 2019 are included on pages F-58 and F-132, respectively, of this Offering Memorandum. The
independent auditor’s report for the KM Group for the seven months ended October 31, 2018 is included on page
F-195 of this Offering Memorandum. The independent auditor’s report for the KM Group for the financial year
ended March 31, 2018 is included on page F-270 of this Offering Memorandum.

Investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements, the independent auditor
confirmed that it does not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as purchasers of the Notes) other than to
Keystone Midco Limited and its members as a body with respect to the report and to the independent auditor’s
audit work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration
statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the US Securities Act
or in a report filed under the US Exchange Act. If a US court (or any other court) were to give effect to such
limiting language, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditor based on its
report or the consolidated financial statements to which it relates could be limited.

#### Keystone Midco Limited 
 Business review Nine months ended 31 July 2021

**Introduction to the Group**

Keepmoat is a leading partnership housebuilder, operating across mainland UK, providing high quality, private affordable homes
primarily to first time buyers and first time movers. We have a strong track record in working with our partners, principally Local Authorities
and Registered Providers, to design, build and regenerate places where people want to live, based on our extensive capabilities across
all aspects of the development process.

We benefit from the strong, long term relationships that we have developed with Local Authorities, Housing Associations and other
Registered Providers as an integral part of our business. Our partnership model allows us to work with landowners, typically Local
Authorities, from the early stages of a development project, such as identification of land opportunities and assessment of project viability,
thereby minimising development risks and allowing us to operate a capital light business model relative to traditional house builders.

**Content of the interim financial statements**

This report contains unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for Keystone Midco Limited and its subsidiary undertakings
(together the “Group”) for the 9 months ended 31 July 2021 together with the income statement for the comparative 9 months ended 31
July 2020 and the balance sheet as at 31 October 2020. The financials have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting
Standard 34 (IAS 34) Interim Financial Reporting.

**Overview of Results**

Group revenue from continuing operations, for the period ended 31 July 2021 at £482.6m (31 July 2020: £260.1m) was 86% higher than
the corresponding period in the prior year.

Plot completions were 75% higher than the prior period at 2,773 (31 July 2020: 1,581).

Group adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for period ended 31 July 2021 was £57.3m (31 July 2020: £(0.4)m).

Net debt as at 31 July 2021 was £133.6m (31 October 2020: £114.3m),

The Group retains sufficient headroom and liquidity within its existing financing facilities with £67.7m of available liquidity at 31 July 2021
(31 October 2020: £74.7m).

 Business review Nine months ended 31 July 2021

**Financial risk management**

In the course of its ordinary activities, the Group is exposed to financial risks which include liquidity, credit and interest rate risks. These
risks are monitored and managed through robust policies and procedures.

Liquidity risk relates to the Group generating sufficient cash flow to meet its operational requirements while avoiding debt covenant
breaches or excessive debt levels. Total borrowings are a combination of long-term loans and long term committed revolving working
capital credit facilities. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group continually monitors open market house sales volumes and prices; working
capital levels and contract profitability; and both client and supplier credit references and credit terms with clients and suppliers to ensure
they continue to be appropriate. Credit risk is in relation to trade receivables from customers. Given that the majority of trade receivables
are with public and regulated organisations, the exposure to credit risk is very limited.

Interest rate risk relates to the impact of interest rate increases on the Group’s floating rate borrowings. The Group’s term loan, revolving
credit and overdraft facilities are all on floating rates. Whilst the risk of an increase in interest rate is beyond the Group’s control,
management continually keeps this exposure under review.

Price risk relates to costs increasing beyond budget due to the reduced availability of skilled labour or shortages of building materials at
competitive prices. The Group works hard to mitigate price increases and ensures that agreements are always competitive and
provide the best quality without compromising on standards.

**Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements**

The directors are responsible for preparing the non-statutory group financial statements in accordance with International

Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) for proposed issue of

senior secured notes by Maison Finco Plc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Maison Bidco Limited, on The International Stock Exchange.

The directors must not approve the non-statutory financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of

the state of affairs of the group and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing the non-statutory financial

statements, the directors are responsible for:

    - selecting suitable accounting policies and then applying them consistently.

    - stating whether applicable IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have been followed,

subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

    - making judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

    - preparing the non-statutory financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the

group will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and

detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are also responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the group’s

transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group.

#### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 30 October 2020

**General information**

Keystone Midco Limited (the Company) is a private limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of the registered
office is Keystone Midco Limited, The Waterfront, Lakeside Boulevard, Doncaster, DN4 5PL.

The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because the Group operates exclusively in the United Kingdom. All financial
information is rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except where otherwise indicated.

These condensed interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies
Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 October 2020 were approved by the board of directors on 28 February 2021 and
delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of
matter paragraph and did not contain any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.

The financial statements have been reviewed, not audited.

**Basis of preparation**

This condensed consolidated interim financial report for the nine month reporting period ended 31 July 2021 has been prepared in
accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standard 34 and contain the unaudited consolidated financial information of
Keystone Midco Limited and its subsidiary undertakings for the period ended 31 July 2021 and a balance sheet as at that date.

The interim report does not include all of the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is
to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 October 2020, which has been prepared in accordance with
international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Unless otherwise stated, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 July 2021 have been
prepared using consistent accounting policies, presentation and a method of computation to those applied in the latest audited statutory
consolidated financial statements of Keystone Midco Limited for the year ended 31 October 2020, which have been prepared in
accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

During the year ended 31 October 2020, sales of part exchange properties have been accounted for on a net basis within cost of sales
which was incorrect. During the current period, part exchange property sales have been disclosed within other operating income with
associated expenses within other operating expenses in line with the requirements of IFRS. The impact of the policy change is to
increase both other operating income and other operating expense in the nine months ended 31 July 2021 by £500,000 (31 July 2020:
£1,200,000). The accounting policy will be amended in the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2021.

Following the acquisition on 11 December 2020 by Castle 1 Limited of 50% of the members' capital holding in BK Scotswood LLP as
detailed in Note 18, it was noted that the previous investment held by the Group in the joint venture BK Scotswood LLP was incorrectly
included in the associates column in Note 7. This has been corrected in these financial statements and the position as at 31 October
2020 has been restated and will be restated within the statutory accounts for the year ended 31 October 2021 also.

Comparative information has been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the Companies

Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting on the same basis as the current year financial information.

**Changes in accounting policies**

- **New standards, interpretations and amendments effective**

A number of standards, interpretations and amendments became effective for the current reporting period. The Group did not have to
change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these standards.

- **Share based payments**

The group established a senior management incentive scheme in the period which required the interpretation of IFRS2.

The fair value of cash-settled, share-based compensation plans is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase
in liabilities. The fair value is measured as at the date the award was granted and is spread over the period in which the employees
become unconditionally entitled to the reward to reflect the actual award that will vest. At the statement of financial position date, if it is
expected that non-market conditions will not be satisfied, the cumulative expense recognised in relation to the relevant award is reversed.

**Going concern**

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have a
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval, having
reassessed the principal risks facing the Group and determined that there are no material uncertainties to disclose. In making their
assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, the Directors have considered the projected performance of the Group,
and both the financial resources currently in place and also those financial resources that are committed and will be available to the

10

#### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 30 October 2020

Group following the completion of the acquisition of Keystone Topco Limited, the 100% immediate parent of the Group by funds
controlled by Aermont Capital LLP (“Aermont”) (“the Aermont Acquisition”).

The assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern has been made both on the basis that the Aermont Acquisition of
the Group is completed (which at the date of this assessment is unconditional under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement dated
4 August 2021 (“SPA”) following satisfaction of all the conditions to the SAP on 20th September 2021) and also on the basis that the
Aermont Acquisition does not complete.

At 31 July 2021 the Group held cash and cash equivalents of £45.2m and total loans and borrowings of £175.0m, which consisted of
£7.3m of overdraft, bank and other loans of £10.2m and £157.5m of term loan facility that matures in December 2024. Should further
funding be required, the Group has a committed £75m RCF (of which an overdraft of £7.3m was utilised at 31 July 2021), subject to
compliance with certain financial covenants, of which £15.0m matures in December 2021 and £60.0m matures in June 2024.

At the date of the assessment, the financial resources that are committed and will be available to the Group on completion of the Aermont
Acquisition total £345m, comprising £275.0m of senior term facilities with a six-year maturity and £70.0m of committed revolving credit
facilities (‘RCF) which have a maturity of five and half years. At completion, £70.0m of the committed RCF will be undrawn. It is Aermont’s
intention that the £275.0m of debt facilities required for the Aermont Acquisition is provided through the proposed issue of senior secured
notes by Maison Finco Plc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Maison Bidco Limited, on The International Stock Exchange. The Offering
Memorandum for the proposed issuance of the senior secured notes has been issued on the date that the condensed consolidated
interim financial report for the nine-month reporting period ended 31 July 2021 was approved by the Directors.

As such, in consideration of its net current assets of £334.4m at 31 July 2021, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient
liquidity to meet its current liabilities and working capital requirements.

The performance of the Group is dependent upon a number of external factors and the wider macro-economic environment in which it
operates. The material factors that may affect the future financial performance of the Group include flat or negative economic growth,
buyer confidence, mortgage availability and affordability, new housing supply, falls in house prices or land values and the cost and
availability of materials, subcontractors and suppliers.

The COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to an increase in the inherent uncertainty in the Group’s assessment of these factors. Since the restart of construction and sales activity in May/June 2020 following the closure of sites in the first national lockdown, the UK housing
market and the Group’s level of sales reservations has shown a strong and continued recovery. Demand relative to supply remains
strong and the business has successfully managed construction activity and new site openings to align delivery accordingly. During the
second national lockdown from November 2020 to January 2021 and throughout the calendar year of 2021 to date the business traded
without significant interruption. However, the outlook remains unclear: whilst unemployment is low and not expected to rise significantly
when the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme ends in Autumn 2021, inflationary pressures from higher energy costs and
supply chain issues may impact the wider macro-economic environment. Future tightening of restrictions in response to new variant
outbreaks of COVID-19 and consequential local or national restrictions may cause further disruption to the Group’s operations.

The Directors’ assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern includes consideration of cash flow forecasts for the
Group and the current borrowing and debt facilities available to the Group and those facilities that are committed and will be available
to the Group following the completion of the Aermont Acquisition.

To assess the Group’s resilience to adverse trading conditions, its financial forecast has been sensitised through a series of scenarios
reflecting the principal downside risks for the UK economy and housing market. The scenarios reflect potential downside risks as
presented in the latest available external economic forecasts.

This exercise included an aggregated reasonable worst-case scenario reflecting a manifestation of the principal risks to a severe but
plausible level. This scenario assumed that sales volumes and average selling prices fall below the levels forecast by the Group by 20%
and 7.5% respectively, and that the Group’s operations are temporarily disrupted for three months due to a national response to a
resurgence of the virus.

The effects were modelled over a 15-month period, alongside reasonable mitigation that the Group would expect to undertake in such
circumstances, primarily a reduction in investment in inventories in line with the fall in expected sales and the actions successfully
deployed during the Group’s closure of its operations in March 2020. The effects have been modelled without assumption of Government
assistance during this period. In all scenarios, including the reasonable worst case, the Group is able to comply with its financial
covenants, operate within its current facilities, and meet its liabilities as they fall due.

The intentions of Aermont and their plans for the Group on completion of the Aermont Acquisition, have been shared with the Group
and are set out in the Offering Memorandum for the proposed issue of senior secured notes by Maison Finco Plc, along with Aermont’s
proposed funding structure. These published intentions, stated in the Offering Memorandum, confirm an alignment to the existing
strategy and support of the management team and confirm that the committed funding structure comprises £476.1m equity, £275.0m
senior secured notes with a six-year maturity profile, as well as a £70.0m RCF.

#### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 30 October 2020

With regards to the Aermont Acquisition, the Directors consider the strength of the available information on Aermont’s intentions for the
Group, the funding secured and related cash flow modelling to be fully supporting of and sufficient for the continued operation of the
Group in line with the projected performance and associated cash flows.

Accordingly, the Directors consider there to be no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
to operate as a going concern. They have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date of approval of these
condensed consolidated interim Financial Statements regardless of whether the Aermont Acquisition completes. For this reason, they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim Financial Statements.
The Group has also reviewed its exposure to climate change and Brexit-related risks and concluded that these did not have a
significant impact on the financial performance and/or position of the Group for the period and as at 31 July 2021, respectively.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Company’s management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised. The estimates and
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year are addressed below

- **Estimation of development profitability**

The gross profit from revenue generated on each of the Group’s developments in a specific period is based on the latest forecast for the
whole site gross profit expected to be generated over the life of that development or phase. The expected gross profit is calculated as
an output of development valuations completed using latest selling prices and forecasts of all land and construction costs associated
with the development. These calculations of expected gross profits require a degree of estimation due to their long-term nature and are
sensitive to future movements in both the estimated cost to complete and expected selling prices.

Group’s management has established internal controls to regularly review and ensure the appropriateness of the forecasts and estimates
made on an individual development basis. However, a change in estimated gross profits over a number of developments (due, for
example, to changes in estimates of costs remaining or a reduction in average selling prices in the private market) could materially affect
profitability. As an illustration, a reasonably possible change in profits of 1% across all developments in the 9 months to 31 July 2021
would have reduced gross profit and net assets by an estimated £4.8m.

- **The right to develop land under a build lease**

The Group enters arrangements with land-owners under which it acquires an interest in land under a build lease with the benefit of a
right to develop. The directors judge these arrangements as in-substance purchases and not leases under the scope of IFRS 16. This
is on the basis that the Group has physical possession of the land and has accepted the asset and the land-owner has an enforceable
right to payment, the freehold is passed to the end customer; the Group takes on any risks associated with the land and ultimately
benefits from the reward on sale of the developed plots. On this basis, land rights acquired under these arrangements are treated as
inventories and are held at the lower of cost or net realisable value as per the Group’s accounting policy for inventories.

- **Acquisition accounting**

When applying IFRS3 principles to the step-acquisition of a subsidiary, the directors exercise judgment in determining the fair value of
equity instruments and the non-controlling interest. These judgments are integral to the recognition of the consolidated assets into the
Group.

**1** **Segment and revenue information**

The Executive Board has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined under IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

The Group operates solely as a housebuilder within the UK. The Executive Board regularly reviews the Group’s performance at both a
Group consolidated and divisional level. Each division is considered an operating segment as defined by IFRS 8. The Executive Board
assesses performance and makes strategic decisions at this level. The divisions have been aggregated in to one reportable operating
segment on the basis that they share similar economic characteristics including:

- Debt is raised centrally, and the cost of capital is the same at each division.

- National supply agreements are in place for key inputs including materials.

- Sales demand at each division is subject to the same macroeconomic factors, such as mortgage availability, government policy
and government incentive schemes

The Group carries out a detailed annual review of the net realisable value of land held for and under development both relating to plots
currently in development, and land and phases of sites not yet in development.

Net realisable value for land where construction of homes had commenced at the period-end or is anticipated to commence within the
next 12 months was assessed by estimating selling prices and costs (including sales and marketing expenses) taking into account
current market conditions.

Land where house building had not commenced at the year-end and was more likely to be sold undeveloped is assessed by re-appraising
the land using current selling prices and costs for the proposed development and assuming an appropriate financial return to reflect the
current housing market conditions and the prevailing financing environment.

On 1 December 2018, the Group issued a £150,000,000 term loan facility attracting interest of 6.5% plus Libor due for repayment on
11 December 2024. On 12 June 2020, the Group entered into an agreement to increase its existing term loan facility by £7,500,000 on
the same terms as the existing facility. This brings the total term loan facility to £157,500,000. On 3 July 2020, the Group drew down
on the £7,500,000 term loan.

At 31 July 2021 the Group had committed borrowing facilities totalling £75,000,000 (31 October 2020: £75,000,000) representing
revolving credit facilities and overdraft, which are due for renewal in June 2025. At 31 July 2021, the Group had bank borrowings
under the revolving credit facility totalling £nil (31 October 2020: £nil) and bank overdrafts of £7,302,000 (31 October 2020 £254,000).
The Group therefore had undrawn facilities totalling £67,698,000 (31 October 2020: £74,746,000). Revolving credit facilities bear
interest at 3.25% over LIBOR whilst cash overdrafts are 3.25% over Bank of England base rate.

Other loans comprise loans from Homes England and a loan from Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council. Interest is charged at a base rate
plus a margin which varies from 2% to 6% between sites. Amounts are repayable on completion of each site for which the loan relates.

October 2020 £254,000). The Group therefore had undrawn facilities totalling £67,698,000 (31 October 2020: £74,746,000). The
guarantees are in the form of floating charges over the assets of certain Group companies.

The Group is party to the Keystone Midco Limited Group (“Midco Group”) senior facility agreement whereby the Midco Group has a
revolving credit facility of £75,000,000. At 31 July 2021, the Midco Group was in a net cash position (31 October 2020: net cash position).

**17** **Related party disclosures**

The directors regard all subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates of Keystone Midco Limited Group to be related parties.

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not
disclosed within the financial statements or related notes. There have been no material changes in the nature of transactions with joint
ventures or associates, which are also related parties, since the last annual financial statements as at, and for the year ended, 31
October 2020. Balances with parent undertakings are disclosed in notes 9 and 11. The transactions in the period primarily comprise
preference share dividends owed to Keystone Top Co Limited.

On 29 June 2021, the Group entered into a contract for the sale of 32 plots to Flint Housing Limited (a Registered Provider). This
contract is an arms’ length transaction with Flint Housing Limited, a company 50% owned by Stephen Stone (Non-Executive Chairman
of the Group and director of Keystone Topco Limited, parent company of Keystone Midco Limited). £135,000 was received as a deposit
on 30 July 2021.

### Strategic Report 

 Chairman’s Statement

Last year Keepmoat Homes¹, and indeed the whole country, faced unprecedented challenges that none of us could ever have
anticipated due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. But I am delighted to say that the business performed strongly throughout and is well
positioned to deliver our future growth plans.

I am extremely proud of the way the Executive Team, led by Tim Beale, have steered the business safely through the crisis with the
support of our highly competent senior management team. I would like to thank the Executive Board and the wider Leadership team and
Regional Directors, across the business, who also showed their support by taking a voluntary 20% salary reduction for the period that
our sites had to be closed during the first national lockdown. This was an act of outstanding leadership and clearly demonstrates their
commitment to Keepmoat Homes.

The value of our Partnership Business model was once again demonstrated last year when it was tested under extreme circumstances,
with the strength of our relationships with our Partners helping us to steer the business safely through the Pandemic.

The Board and our lenders are confident that our unique Partnership Business Model will continue to drive our future success. This was
clearly demonstrated last year when we were able to increase our credit facilities by £27.5 million and our shareholders signalled their
continued support with an injection of additional equity, and the business embarked on a programme of significant investment in new IT
infrastructure.

Keepmoat Homes is a different type of home builder which is uniquely placed to serve the needs of the UK today. It is the UK’s largest
partnership focused home builder committed to building sustainable communities in places where people want to live. We put our
customers first and deliver high quality affordable homes, using a mix of tenures across the country.

One of Keepmoat’s defining features is its quality product at affordable prices. With an average selling price of £165,000, Keepmoat
helps customers achieve their ambitions of owning their own homes, with 70% of the homes we sell, on the open market, being sold to
first time buyers. I am delighted that during the last financial year our customer score increased to over 90%, giving the Group five-star
builder status across all our developments.

We are a trusted partner of Homes England, local authorities and registered providers, with many of these relationships enduring for
over 20 years. These trusted and lasting partnerships underpin our multi-tenure strategy and our position as a top 10 UK home builder.
Our work with registered providers and the build-to-rent market (or private rented sector) is important to us, as our partners want to see
more multi-tenure developments. Furthermore, as the UK’s leading brownfield homebuilder with 80% of current developments on
brownfield sites, our work goes beyond the delivery of new homes. By regenerating urban and brownfield land, we create thriving new
communities and we are delighted to see continued support for bringing forward brownfield land from the public sector.

Finally, I would like to thank each and every one of our people for all their hard work every day, our reliable supply chain and our strategic
business partners for their commitment to Keepmoat Homes.

Stephen Stone
**Non-Executive Chairman**

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Executive’s Strategic Update

Reflecting on the last financial year, I want to start by saying how proud I am of what we have achieved in successfully steering the
business through the Coronavirus crisis. The last financial year has been one where we have faced unprecedented challenges with the
impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic continuing to affect all aspects of our daily lives. However, I am delighted to report that on
the back of a very positive start to the year, whilst our financial and operational results were significantly impacted by the period of
shutdown and ongoing economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19, our business has demonstrated the resilience of the multi tenure
partnership model, and we are in a strong position moving forwards and well set up to deliver our future growth plans.

We made a good start to the year with positive post-election sentiment and demand for new homes reflected in excellent sales figures
and the business trading in line with our expectations for the period to March, before the onset of the pandemic. Demand for new homes
has remained strong throughout as one of the effects of the Pandemic has been to make people place greater value on owning their
own homes with flexible space for living, working, exercising and relaxing. Our predominantly First Time Buyer audience and average
selling price of £165,000 has further supported our continued strong performance. In fact, our forward order book and pipeline in all our
regions remain strong across all tenures, this forward visibility positions us well for investment and growth in the future.

When the UK entered its first national lockdown, as a responsible home builder, we prioritised the safety of our people, our customers
and the communities we work with and took the decision to temporarily cease operations. All our developments were closed in a safe
and secure manner at the start of April 2020, with surplus PPE donated to NHS Trusts and Charities to support medical staff and key
workers. During the shutdown period, the business supported customers who were ready to complete, as lockdown restrictions came
into force, to ensure that they were able to safely move into their new homes.

Throughout the first national lockdown interest and demand for new homes remained strong, with our sales teams working remotely and
many customers choosing to reserve their new homes online. As lockdown restrictions began to be eased in May, the business
implemented a phased reopening programme.

Sales offices were reopened with the creation of a bespoke online appointment booking system to allow customers to visit our sales
centres and show homes across the UK safely, in line with Government and Public Health guidelines.

In the previous financial year, we had already invested in digital technologies to re-engineer the customer journey to make the process
of buying a new home even easier and more closely aligned to the expectations of our young customer demographic. This investment
has paid dividends, with the reserve online tool enabling the business to continue to sell homes whilst sales offices were closed during
lockdown. Further enhancements including the appointment booking system and an online payment tool to enable all payments to be
made via the website, enabled sales offices to reopen safely, operating on an appointment only basis and minimising unnecessary
contacts.

The bookings tool has provided additional benefits to the business with improved visibility on footfall to sites, enabling staffing levels to
be optimised accordingly. Looking ahead and building on the success of the Reserve Online tool, phase two is now in development to
include additional features such as ID checks, anti-money laundering checks and electronic document signing.

**Reserve Online Tool statistics for the year ended 31 October 2020:**

   - Online reservations – 1,254

   - Online payments - £1,673,892

   - Online accounts created – 10,449

   - Digital sales offices opened – 8

The business maintained close contact with its supply chain partners throughout to ensure we were able to restart sites and return to
normal operations as safely and efficiently as possible and has continued to pay all suppliers, subcontractors and service providers on
normal terms.

We also made use of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, when our teams were placed on furlough, enabling us to protect the jobs
of our c1,100 employees and ensure the business was in a strong position to restart as soon as it was safe to do so. Throughout this
period all employees including those on furlough were paid 100% of their salary. In addition, our Executive Board, the wider Leadership
team and Regional Directors across the business took a voluntary 20% salary reduction for the period that sites were closed. I would
like to thank them for their commitment to supporting the business.

The confidence of our lenders in the strength and resilience of the business allowed us to successfully increase our credit facilities by
£27.5 million creating greater liquidity, and our shareholders signalled their continued support with an injection of additional equity.

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Executive’s Strategic Update

I believe that the way we have successfully steered the business through this crisis is testament to the strength of our extremely
competent management team, with the right people now in the right roles to drive the business forward. I am also delighted to report
that, during the last financial year, Debbie Waddington, Group HR Director, was promoted to the Executive Board, in recognition of her
significant contribution and further underpinning the importance of our people to the business

During the initial lockdown period, our IT team supported the business with the fast deployment of the right equipment to allow people
to work from home and facilitated the adoption of video conferencing and remote team working tools supported by investment in
technology in board rooms and regional offices around the country. I am extremely proud of the way our highly engaged people came
together right across the business, rose to the challenge and adapted to new ways of working.

During this period, we used our time effectively to plan for the future and invest in new technology. With the support of our shareholders
we have committed to the adoption of DXC Home Builder One, the fully integrated homebuilder ERP solution, powered by Microsoft
Dynamics 365. We are the first UK homebuilder to adopt this technology which will give us best in class systems and infrastructure to
take the business forward. To spearhead this vital business transformation and lead our IT team moving forwards, Myles Gibbins has
been appointed to the role of IT & Digital Director. Myles brings over 20 years’ experience in the home building industry and unrivalled
knowledge and experience of delivering similar business transformation projects.

**A regional focus on national delivery**

Keepmoat Homes is committed to delivering high-quality, affordable homes across the UK, with nine regional businesses organised into
two divisions: The North Division, comprising Scotland, the North West, MCI (North West), the North East and West Yorkshire; and the
South Division, comprising East Yorkshire, East Midlands, West Midlands and South Midlands. A Divisional Chairman is responsible
for each of the two divisions, supported by a Divisional Finance Director.

The above divisional and regional structure follows a structural review conducted by the Keepmoat Homes board, under which the
Groups operations were reorganised in some geographies to ensure that the business is optimally structured to continue to progress
with the delivery of its growth plans.

This included the merger of our Keepmoat Homes presence in the North West within a single region to leverage the combined leadership
team and deliver a consolidated approach to the regional market, operating the South West region as a satellite to the West Midlands
office, and the relocation of our Southern regional office from Luton to the Northamptonshire area, to focus our presence in the South
Midlands geography that has proved more suitable and successful for the Keepmoat business model.

The regional businesses and their boundaries will remain flexible allowing for growth and expansion into new areas where this makes
sense and is required to enable all offices to remain at an optimum size for effective management.

Each of the regional businesses has its own management board and is empowered to deliver our overarching operational excellence
strategy, applying the Group’s policies and systems to local markets and circumstances. This structure and approach mean that we are
well positioned for future growth in the right locations.

Over the past twelve months we have continued to concentrate driving excellence in all areas of the business including launching our
Operational Excellence Strategy and introducing even greater rigour to manage our sites holistically to fully optimise our development
economics over the full lifecycle of our developments. With enhanced financial processes and reporting, this enables us to ensure we
are buying land with the right margins and in the right locations. As a result, we remain well positioned to deliver shareholder value and
delight our customers by building more of the high-quality homes they deserve, in the places they want to live.

At the end of last year, we delivered a series of High-Performance Culture sessions to our Senior Leaders and Management Teams to
support them in our drive to create high-preforming teams right across the business. We have already come a long way in this area but
recognise that we still have more to do.

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Executive’s Strategic Update

**The Strength of our Partnership Business Model**

Our partnership business model is what sets us apart from our competitors. It gives us the ability to secure land on a capital light basis
by agreeing payment terms aligned to site development which combined with other aspects of our partnership operating model deliver
strong capital returns and lower business risk.

The value of our Partnership approach has been clearly demonstrated this year, when the strength of the relationships with our partners,
including both land owners and registered providers of affordable housing, has contributed to our continued success during the
Coronavirus Pandemic by enabling us to manage our working capital effectively, giving us the confidence to deliver our growth plans
through further periods of lockdown and to continue to build more of the new affordable homes the UK needs.

We are the largest delivery partner of Homes England, delivering over 19,000 homes in partnership with them as a member of
consecutive Delivery Partner Panels since 2009 and accessing over £387m in funding initiatives. We have used the Home Building and
other Homes England Funds to accelerate the delivery of over 2,600 homes and Help to Buy to help c70% of our private customers to
own their own home.

We have built our reputation by aligning our approach with our partners’ objectives to deliver successful, large scale, mixed-tenure,
developments. We have a proven track record of revitalising communities through the delivery of high-quality homes, in well-designed
and well-connected neighbourhoods and at prices that customers can afford. Over the last 25 years we have successfully delivered new
homes in some of the country’s most challenging housing markets, demonstrating our commitment to delivery even in the most
demanding market conditions.

Our partnership approach delivers many advantages including:

- An ability to deliver large scale multi-phased development sites, providing a strong forward pipeline of land

- The opportunity to work with partners who are motivated not only by financial returns, but also by non-financial outcomes
(including - accelerated delivery, social value, sustainability and design quality);

- The potential to access grant funding or investment support from Homes England and Local Authority partners; and

- The opportunity to secure repeat business from existing partners and landowners, or to generate new business opportunities on
the strength of our track record and reputation for delivery.

**Community and Stakeholder Engagement**

Our extensive experience and commitment to stakeholder engagement underpins our partnership approach and demonstrates the
importance we place on working with communities and involving local people at all stages of neighbourhood projects. We recognise the
value of recognising local needs and making sure all voices are heard to deliver real improvements to our developments. We actively
support our partners in the development and implementation of stakeholder engagement strategies, working proactively to ensure that
lines of communication are opened and maintained and that we take the right approach.

**Placing our Customers at the Heart of Our Business**

Delivering high quality new homes and delighting our customers continues to be our top priority, so I am pleased to say that in the 12month NHBC reporting period, Keepmoat Homes increased its customer satisfaction score to 92.6% which is sufficient to achieve a 5star builder status across the business and I am extremely proud of that achievement. This is a 5.7% improvement on our score in sine
the last Home Builders Federation (HBF) annual customer satisfaction survey.

Customer satisfaction is at the heart of everything we do. Ensuring our customers are supported throughout their journey with us, meeting
their expectations and providing them with a high-quality new home is extremely important to us.

We review our processes on an ongoing basis and continually strive to introduce further improvements to allow us to deliver greater
levels of customer service. We include all regional management teams in this process to ensure improvements are delivered consistently
across our entire business.

Our bespoke quality inspection process “Hallmark” has enabled us to deliver greater and more consistent levels of quality control to the
homes we build. We are continuing to develop this to introduce even more rigour to processes to make sure we continue to deliver high
quality homes for our customers. In addition to the changes to Hallmark, we have also developed a range of training programmes for
our people, which are regularly delivered to ensure they understand the importance we place on delighting our customers.

We maintain close contact with our customers throughout their journey with us, from their initial enquiry, during the exciting process of
purchasing their new homes and after they move in, to ensure they consistently receive a high level of service. This year has presented
the whole country with significant challenges due to the impact of COVID-19, and inevitably our speed of response to customer issues
has been affected by the increased health and safety measures we had implement. We have now returned to working in our customers’
homes but under strict guidelines to ensure the safety of our customers and our people. Our customers have been very understanding
of the situation and have been extremely patient during our return to more normal ways of working.

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Executive’s Strategic Update

To help us to monitor our customer satisfaction levels we participate in the National House Building Council (NHBC) customer satisfaction
Survey. We monitor every survey and reflect on the valuable comments made by our customers and use this feedback to learn and
improve. For over a year these survey results show our customer satisfaction levels for the group to be over 90%. We also use this
information to identify and reward our people who demonstrate excellence in delivering customer service.

As a business we are committed to providing our customers with fantastic levels of service, from providing comprehensive information
and guidance on their new home to dealing with issues and queries quickly and efficiently.

What matters to our customers:

- A home delivered on time, to the right quality, that is great value for money;

- Great service both during and after the purchase;

- An environment that has been created to provide great amenities and green space;

- A community that they can enjoy and thrive in; and

- Knowing that the development has contributed to the wider community and considered and supported a positive environmental
impact.

**Positive Market Positioning**

The fundamental underpinnings for the UK Housing Market have remained strong including Government support, low interest rates and
increased desire and aspiration to own a home. This has remained true despite the unprecedented challenges imposed by the ongoing
COVID-19 Pandemic, the continued uncertainty over the impact of the future relationship and trade agreements with the EU and the
resulting uncertainty around employment and negative impacts on the wider economy.

Keepmoat, with an average sales price of £165,000 and limited exposure to London and the South East, performed well to the end of
March 2020 with sales across all regions in line with our expectations. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the period of
shutdown that resulted had an impact during the remainder of 2020. Accordingly, the Board has continued to consider the potential
effect on our business and has updated risk assessments. Key risks have been identified, such as the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the UK economy, supply and cost of materials, the impact on availability of labour and potential changes to Government policy and
regulation.

The business has appropriate mitigation plans in place to address any adverse impacts should they arise. Most of our building supplies
are manufactured in the UK and are not at risk from future trade arrangements with the EU. An element of the products procured through
our network of UK based suppliers will be imported from the EU and we are working closely with those suppliers to monitor the potential
impact as the UK adapts to the new trade arrangements with the EU. We believe that the Group’s multi-tenure partnership approach
and expertise in the first-time buyer market provides some resilience should any adverse market effects arise because of the COVID19 pandemic.

We will continue to closely monitor market conditions into the future considering wider political and economic developments.

**Government commitment to housing supply**

The policy landscape of the last 12 months has combined short-term responses to the pandemic with a post-election change of direction
for planning and housebuilding.

One of the most promising visions of the new government was to ‘level up’ and support those parts of the country that had been left
behind. The Prime Minister’s ‘Build, Build, Build’ speech in June established the central role of housebuilding and construction in
spearheading national economic recovery after the first COVID-19 lockdown. Since then, housebuilding has been supported through
the Stamp Duty holiday on properties up to the value of £500,000 until 31 March 2021, more flexible construction site working hours,
creation of the Construction Talent Retention Scheme and extended planning permission deadlines with planning committees also
meeting remotely.

The Help to Buy build and completion deadlines have been extended by two months to allow completion of delayed homes. Help to Buy
is a popular and vital scheme that provides choice for homebuyers and stimulates construction of new homes. Keepmoat has supported
a refocusing of the scheme on first time buyers from April 2021, with the majority of our homes being priced within the new Help to Buy
price thresholds.

We continue to work with both government agencies and mortgage providers on innovative mortgage products and other alternatives
to the successful Help to Buy schemes.

-----

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Executive’s Strategic Update

We welcome elements of the Planning White Paper which includes positives for housebuilders. More speed and predictability in planning
decisions will enable us to build many more homes while national standardisation, especially in space standards, will enable us to do so
more efficiently. We also welcome a green agenda that prioritises brownfield land and requires energy efficiency, biodiversity and
sustainable development.

A national planning system, charged with a desire to level up all areas of the UK, is a powerful post-pandemic vision. If we are moving
to an era of more homeworking, homebuyers will have greater flexibility on where they live and will be able to choose to buy in areas
where their money goes further. In these areas they will be able to afford houses, rather than apartments, with more space, more rooms
and larger gardens. Supporting those ambitions is a key driver of Keepmoat’s business.

We note the recent Government announcement that it is committed to funding and supporting the removal of unsafe cladding on highrise buildings. Keepmoat Homes has conducted a desktop review and has not identified the need for any remedial works associated
with the removal of combustible cladding in relation to multi occupancy residential structures in its legacy development portfolio.

In support of industry initiatives to improve fire safety moving forwards Keepmoat Homes has become a registered signatory to The
Building A Safer Charter Declaration of Commitment which is designed to drive the culture change and action required to improve
building safety by making improvements to current practice and behaviours.

**The UK’s leading brownfield homebuilder**

Keepmoat Homes is the UK’s leading brownfield homebuilder, meaning we do more than just deliver new homes. We regenerate urban
and brownfield land to create thriving new communities. 80% of our current developments are on brownfield sites.

We are pleased to see continued support to bringing forward brownfield land from the public sector. Our work with local authorities
across the UK including in Newcastle, Doncaster, Nottingham and Glasgow, provides model approaches for others to follow. For
example, through our partnership with Newcastle City Council our scheme at Scotswood will deliver over 1,150 new homes over the
next 12 years.

**Sustainability**

At Keepmoat Homes we think and act beyond bricks and mortar. As well as creating better places for people to live, our success depends
on us playing our part in building the sustainable communities and enhanced environment our partners and customers want. We work
with our partners to create and improve places and in turn improve economic, environmental and social outcomes, working to deliver
our vision of Building Communities, Transforming Lives.

In July we published our Sustainability Strategy. Through stakeholder consultation, we identified our material issues and aligned the
strategy to eight of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

We are committed to minimising our impact on the environment and biodiversity. Working with the Wildlife Trust Consultancy,
Wildscapes, we are looking to develop methodologies to ensure we deliver a net gain in biodiversity by 2023.

You can read more about our commitment to delivering a sustainable future in our Corporate Sustainability Strategy which details our
achievements over the last 12 months as well as outlining our future commitments.

There is no doubt that the last financial year has been extremely challenging, but I am delighted by the way the business has emerged
from the crisis in a strong position to push ahead and looking to the future I am extremely confident that Keepmoat Homes will continue
to go from strength to strength.

Finally, but most importantly, I would like to thank all our people, our supply chain and our business partners, who have worked with
Keepmoat Homes for their contribution to our success and for all their hard work, particularly in what has been such a challenging year.
We could not have achieved what we have this year without them.

### Strategic Report – Our Vision, Mission and Values

Our vision, mission and values shape our strategy and the way we work, and mean we are a different type of housebuilder. Our
corporate strengths include our local knowledge, long term partner relationships, national and local presence, supply chain and our
ability to enhance local economies by employing local firms and creating local jobs.

**Keepmoat Vision:**

**_Building Communities, Transforming lives._**

This means that we think and act beyond bricks and mortar. As well as creating better places for people to live, we know that our
success depends on us playing our part in building the strong communities our partners and customers want.

We work with our partners to regenerate places to improve economic and social outcomes for the local community while providing
housing choice in these areas. We focus on improving the communities we work in and the people we serve, creating significant local
economic benefits through our supply chain and local employment. 8% of our workforce are trainees (2019: 8%), apprentices and
graduates.

**Keepmoat Mission:**

**_We are committed to developing enduring relationships to build more, vibrant new communities at prices our customers can_**
**_afford._**

Our Mission explains how we are very different from a traditional housebuilder. It’s in what we do, and how we do it. We create long
term partnerships with land owners and with registered providers of affordable housing. Together we build attractive, affordable and
high- quality homes and communities where people want to live, work and play.

We bring together all facets of housing development, including design, planning and community engagement skills, to help partners
achieve their ambitions. We nurture an extensive supply chain of small and medium sized companies that support us around the
country and make that supply chain available to our public and private sector partners.

**Keepmoat Values:**

**_Straightforward, Passionate, Collaborative and Creative._**

Our Values support the vision, shape the culture and reflect how we work and behave.

   - Straightforward: We get the job done in the most efficient way. We are friendly, open and honest. In other words, the people
you could trust on any project, large or small.

   - Passionate: We care about what we do. We put pride and energy into delivering results. We give the best, so more people
can enjoy living in safe, happy communities and homes.

   - Collaborative: We work together in partnership to deliver the very best customer experience. By sharing our expertise, we
can build the very best quality new homes.

   - Creative: We are proactive, flexible and resourceful. We listen, learn and deliver solutions.

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

Keepmoat’s existing strengths support our growth ambitions:

**National scale, local understanding. Keepmoat has successfully grown into a large national business with deep local roots and we**
intend to maintain that national and local approach.

**Develop our comprehensive offer. We have a broad set of skills ranging from developing partnerships, establishing supply chains,**
building new homes of all tenures and supporting large-scale, housing-led community regeneration schemes.

**Organic growth. In the next five years we intend to increase the number of new homes we build for sale or rent and continue to make**
a significant contribution to meeting the country’s housing needs.

**Market and sector expansion. The need for more housing means we can bring our distinct approach to new markets:**

   - **Grow our core: Our core markets will remain first time buyer homes, and we will continue to work in partnership with local**
authorities and housing associations. We will continue to build our presence in this market.

   - **Enter new geographies: We continue to expand our offer into Scotland, the South West and South of England, where we**
have historically had little presence.

   - **Enter new sectors: We will enter new markets, so more housing opportunities will be created. We are expanding our home**
offer by introducing offsite manufacturing into our developments and are creating partnerships with financial organisations
combined with our skills and capabilities to create new homes in the private rental sector.

**Leveraging our scale. We have grown mostly by financing and delivering medium sized housing programmes, whether homes for sale**
or new build for rent. Now, our national scale and financial strength together with the breadth of our experience and depth of our skills
and capabilities, means we are delivering a greater number of larger programmes and partnerships as the core part of our business.

**Shape more partnerships. At the heart of our growth will be deeper and broader partnerships with existing and new partners. That**
requires us to understand partners’ challenges and objectives and develop ways to help them meet their goals whether economic growth; social - tackling deprivation, improving health; environmental - reducing carbon consumption; financial - reducing operating
costs; operational - improving customer service; or strategic - developing their housing portfolios.

**Efficiency and effectiveness. As we grow bigger, we risk becoming less agile. Through our model of regional autonomy, we want the**
best of both worlds - being local and agile, almost like a small business can be. But we also want the benefits of being a large business
such as professional rigour, quality, efficiency and effectiveness in winning and delivering work. That means we share what works well
and avoid duplication and unnecessary costs, as our customers expect.

**Building our brand. To build more homes we will need more people to choose to work for us as colleagues or with us as suppliers and**
partners. That means we need to be better understood. Our audiences need to know what we do, how we do it and why we are both
different, and better, than the competition. We are continuing to build our profile with our partners and across the industry, improving
brand position with customers as a 5-star builder.

**Our Essentials**

Our Essentials are the five basic building blocks of our business.

   - Safety: The safety of people, partners and communities is at the heart of everything we do.

   - Quality: We work to exceed our stakeholders’ expectations of our service, product and delivery.

   - Customers: We focus on delighting our customers.

   - People: Our people are the heart of our business, providing a service we are proud of.

   - Sustainability: We protect the environment, act ethically and leave a positive legacy.

**Developing Our Product**

As a partnership home builder, we are committed to delivering high value, high quality affordable homes and sustainable developments
designed to create spaces where people want to live, work and relax.

Fundamental to our design principals is creating a sense of community through the delivery of new homes of mixed tenures in attractive,
regenerative environments that complement existing local areas and promote health and wellbeing.

The protection of ecological features is essential, as is the inclusion of sustainable drainage solutions and green infrastructure strategies,
supported by ecological assessments, to enhance and future proof the sustainability and attractiveness of our developments. We also
strive to address the future impacts of climate change such as extreme weather events and overheating.

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

**Construction Excellence**

We actively contribute to the NHBC Standards Review Group and other industry working groups to help ensure our design, detailing
and specification represent best practice and are aligned to future change. As a registered signatory to the Building a Safer Future
Charter we are committed to raising standards in building safety including early adoption of the principles of the Fire Safety Bill.

Quality is a top priority for the business and all supporting design detailing, workmanship and material specifications have been
developed to embody good practice and simplification; written in plain English and supported with illustrations and photographs. These
documents, created in collaboration with all departments including subcontractor forums, are used at all stages of design, procurement
and subcontractor appointment. They have informed the Keepmoat quality training programmes, site inductions and are also used as
build quality checks. Documents are also aligned to regulatory requirements with the additional decision taken to remove all combustible
materials from external walls.

**Outstanding Build Quality**

A first-class construction process is vital to our business and to this end we have introduced several new initiatives to bring about
improvements. We have reviewed our key build stage inspection procedure and now have a formal inspection and sign off process that
allows us to benchmark our build quality. Alongside this we have produced a series of best practice guides for our site teams to ensure
that our homes meet the required standard and comply with our detailed trade specification. This inspection procedure is in addition to
the formal inspections carried out by building control and the warranty provider.

We recognise that having the right people and teams on site and supporting them in their roles is key to a successful business. We have
introduced a site management development programme which will take all new site-based employees through a series of training
workshops to give them the detailed knowledge around programming, quality and cost control that they need to deliver a successful site.
This programme is delivered by our senior managers and includes formal training on building regulations and defect prevention delivered
by external providers to ensure our teams are kept up to date with the latest regulations.

Following the initial success of the programme we are now expanding it to include all our existing site-based teams, which will act as a
refresher and ensure a consistent approach across all our developments. As we move into 2021, we are also rolling out development
programmes for our Contracts Managers and we are introducing an Assistant Site Manager Apprenticeship.

**Sustainability by Design**

We strive to innovate and develop our designs to suit the requirements of all our customers including first-time buyers, families, social
housing partners, supported housing providers, and the elderly by including enhanced mobility standards which support the needs of
both able-bodied and disabled people.

All our developments will benefit from 1 Gigabit day one broadband connectivity.

A key element of our Corporate Sustainability Strategy is our commitment to building affordable low carbon homes and to delivering
homes that meet the gas free Future Homes Standard and Zero carbon standards.

A detailed roadmap is being developed to support our approach to delivering homes that meet the Future Homes standard. In addition,
creating flexible, adaptable spaces will balance improved fabric performance and prevent overheating with reduced energy waste and
the integration of renewable energy solutions supported with smart energy controls. Key to any low carbon solution will be the reduction
in home running costs, essential in addressing fuel poverty.

We are focused on reducing the carbon footprint of the homes we build, including working with our supply chain to reduce the carbon
footprint of the materials we use, as well as reducing water usage and waste. The use of timber frame construction, which accounted
for 12% of homes completed during the year (2019: 12%), and the integration of our digital designs will increase our ability to use offsite
manufactured components.

Developing our building methods will help to address the skills shortage facing the industry, while supporting the continued use of local
labour, enhancing build quality and increasing efficiency and rate of delivery.

**Modern Methods of Construction**

Customer satisfaction, quality and safety are our priorities and the development of our range to the newly approved enhanced digital
format will further support improved efficiency, waste reduction and collaboration with our 3[rd] party designers. The range accounted for
85% of all homes delivered in the year 2020.

The new digital models have been further developed with a focus on enabling flexible elevation treatments to be created from standard
components to facilitate bespoke street scene creation in response to local design codes, within a development.

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

**Our vision is to build a more efficient and Strategic Supply Chain.**

Our regional buyers work in partnership with framework suppliers to ensure successful operation of the arrangements providing feedback
on performance and service, and on future requirements.

Our suppliers play an essential role in our business, providing the materials and services we use to build our homes. It is therefore
essential that we build long-lasting, strong relationships that make us their partner of choice.

We operate a series of group-wide, long-term strategic frameworks providing preferential commercial terms and service levels nationally
and regionally for supply of our materials, site equipment and business consumables.

These arrangements offer significant pricing advantages, whilst also including important delivery, service and product warranties which
helps us maintain and improve our quality and service to our customers.

The Group Supply Chain team manage over 97 arrangements which are made up of framework agreements, commercial arrangements
and formal price lists. In the year to 31 October 2020, 88% of direct spend was channelled through our frameworks.

The Framework Agreements align with the Keepmoat Homes Standard Specification and deliver innovative solutions to support our
drive for standardisation. They also provide customer care and product warranty support to our customer services teams. Many of the
agreements provide value engineering support, free site surveys and scheduling and pricing services.

Several of our Framework Agreements are with manufacturers and suppliers who provide their products through our subcontractors and
compliance to these agreements was 97% during the year.

**Management of Cost and Best Practice**

We work hard to mitigate price increases and ensure that agreements are always competitive and provide the best quality without
compromising on standards. We work in partnership with our suppliers to deliver the best solution for our site teams and our customers.
Many agreements include provision of supplier training for our people and our subcontractors.

**Management of Supply Chain Risk**

We maintain regular contact with suppliers and manufacturers to ensure continuity of supply, negotiating product allocation by volume.
Availability of materials is secured in line with demand and we carefully manage the supply of key products, such as bricks and
plasterboard, by working with the regional businesses and our supply chain partners. We ordered circa 20 million bricks in 2020, all are
sourced in the UK.

We engage with our suppliers to keep them informed of key forecasting information, providing them with a rolling build programme on a
monthly basis in addition to product specific demand schedules. We also notify our supply chain of any changes to our working practices
as appropriate. These long-term frameworks reduce business risk and help ensure a secure supply of our essential materials.

In 2020 we reviewed our homecare defects and identified high risk products. This has allowed us to proactively reduce and mitigate any
future defects, promoting an environment for both internal and external stakeholders where product innovation is welcomed.

**Sustainability in the Supply Chain**

We promote sustainability within the supply chain through our sustainable procurement policy. Working closely with our sustainability
team ensuring all suppliers provide data in a timely manner and to a format that identifies the key metrics. We work with our supply chain
partners to support the development of reporting tools. Whilst every effort is made to support our supply chain, where business critical
data is not provided, an alternative partner is identified to ensure we meet our key obligations.

We engage with waste management consultants in our drive for waste reduction on site with a focus moving forward on reporting as a
tool for managing waste intensity and the management of waste up the waste hierarchy i.e. pallet repatriation, maximising re-use and
recycling where possible.

Management of office waste is due to be pulled together under one supplier across all regions. This will provide a single point of contact
for reporting, management of waste reduction and ensuring legal compliance with waste disposal obligations.

We work with supply chain partners to ensure compliance with our policies i.e. anti-bribery & corruption, modern slavery, equal
opportunities, health and safety and environmental policies as well as inclusion of our supplier chain partners own polices where
available.

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

**Brexit**

There are several key areas where the impact of the UK’s new trading relationship with the European Union may have an impact on
pricing and availability of product. Uncertainty in the market and basic supply/demand economics may also drive UK manufactured
product prices higher as the rates for imported products increase.

We have worked closely with our supply chain since the result of the vote to leave the European Union to ensure that we understand
the changes arising from Brexit. We have continued with this close engagement since the confirmation of the new trade arrangements
to understand their challenges and contingency strategies. These include careful monitoring, increasing UK stock holding and diverting
imports to alternative UK ports where bottlenecks are predicted. At this stage, we have not experienced any significant supply chain
issues associated with Brexit.

**Focusing on our People and Our Culture**

As a people-centric business, a key focus is delivering our people strategy. This means ensuring that we are the employer of choice in
the home building industry, attracting the right talent, develop our existing talent and engaging all our employees so that they enjoy
working for Keepmoat Homes and feel engaged, trusted, committed and can realise their full potential and grow their career with us.

**Culture**

We put our people at the heart of everything we do. Our culture is aligned to our values – it is straightforward, passionate, creative and
highly collaborative; it is also based on openness, challenge, questioning, innovation, high performance and high engagement. Our
environment is fast paced, friendly and one where people are supported with their development and encouraged to grow.

Understanding the link between our vision, values and our behaviours, culture and the way we work is extremely important and is
covered at our corporate induction events for our new joiners. This focus on our culture has driven great improvements in our processes,
our customer focus and the quality of our product, all of which has driven an increase in our levels of customer satisfaction. During the
last 12 months we have developed this further by launching our Operational Excellence Strategy, which enables our people to
understand how their roles align with this and contribute to its delivery.

**Talent and Development**

The emphasis on development and our approach to talent mapping and succession planning is carried out in conjunction with our PDR
process to understand the alignment with our employees’ career aspirations and development objectives. This enables our managers
to focus on understanding and supporting their teams and on helping them to realise their potential and gives us a clear talent pipeline
enabling us to achieve the right balance between our external recruitment and internal promotions.

We have rolled out our Future Leaders Programme, a year-long programme aimed at our high performers that have the potential to
reach a senior leadership role and focused on leadership style and skills, coaching and mentoring.

We also support our Senior Leaders with their development through a series of Leadership Masterclasses as well as coaching,
psychometrics and feedback. Looking forwards we will be doing more work with our Senior Leaders to embed our High-Performance
Culture.

**Apprentices, Trainees and Graduates**

We are proud to be a member of the 5% Club which means we are committed to at least 5% of our employees being apprentices or
trainees in ‘earn and learn’ positions across all functions within the business or through our subcontractors and partners. This approach
supports our skilled teams, addresses skills shortages and opens this very important sector as a great career opportunity to them. We
work in partnership with Collab Group to source our apprentices and they have also supported us with the development of our Sales
Development Programme which leads to a formal qualification.

We are also excited to be launching our Land and Partnerships Graduate Scheme during the next financial year. This is the first graduate
scheme launched by Keepmoat Homes, but we intend to extend this to more areas of the business in the future.

**Diversity and Equality**

We are keen to encourage diversity. The house building industry is not known for being the most diverse or gender equal and there is
often a lack of candidates for certain roles from diverse backgrounds. We now have two female Regional Managing Directors and our
approach to identifying and developing our talent will continue our focus in this important area. We now also have our first female
Executive Board member.

There is still more to do however and as a company we take the role of promoting the industry to potential candidates who might not
have considered a career in our sector very seriously. We work closely with education providers and community groups to profile the
variety of roles available. We also focus on family friendly changes such as meeting start times to support our employees with children.
Over the last 12 months our Agile Working Policy has supported our people with working remotely at home and in different locations
during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to make a significant contribution to helping us to successfully steer the business through
a period of unprecedented challenges.

Average number of employees, split by gender, for the year ended 31 October 2020:

**Disability statement**

The Group is committed to achieving a balanced and diverse workforce and pursues an equal opportunities policy through all areas
including recruitment and selection, training and development, performance reviews, succession planning, promotion and ultimately,
retirement. It is our policy to ensure employee related decisions are made based on merit and capability regardless of religion, race,
nationality, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age or disability. If any of our people become disabled, the Group is
committed to continue employment wherever possible and to undertake the necessary adjustments to facilitate ongoing employment.

**Modern Slavery Act 2015**

The Group has a policy statement in accordance with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Our policy sets out the processes
and practices that we have implemented, to ensure that modern slavery has no place to survive within our business, or within our supply
chain. We monitor the effectiveness and review the implementation of this policy, regularly considering its suitability, adequacy and
effectiveness.

**Wellbeing**

We take the health and wellbeing of our people seriously. Our KeepWell programme, which includes a focus on Mental Health Awareness
has been particularly important over the last 12 months when the resources and tools provided have supported our people through the
challenges of the ongoing pandemic. We have used this very effectively to highlight the importance of mental health as well as physical
health. A particular focus has been on breaking down the stigma and barriers associated with people talking about their mental health.
This year we have trained 33 mental health first aiders across the business supporting all regions, regularly communicating tips and
advice for mental health support.

**Regional Autonomy**

As a business with nine regions supported by Group Divisional and Central Services it is important that we all work together to support
our Vision and that this is underpinned by our Values and Behaviours. Ensuring we are all aligned with our Group wide governance
framework is also vital. Our Regional Autonomy model provides the framework for how this culture of responsibility and accountability
works in practice and our Leadership teams ensure it is communicated to all employees. Our vision, values and culture are at the core
of our business and form the basis of our corporate induction so new colleagues can be effective from day one.

**Investors in People (IIP)**

Our people-centric culture is recognised in our Investors in People (IIP) accreditation and is something we are very proud of and
committed to maintaining. It was noted that our effective people centric culture has a positive impact on our performance as a business.

**Our commitment to Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006**

Keepmoat aims to be a company that is attractive to investors, delivers high-quality new homes for its customers at prices they can
afford, builds long-term relationships with its partners and that is the employer of choice in the home-building industry. This requires the
Board, senior leadership and all our people to maintain an approach to strategic, financial and operational decision-making that is valuesbased, collaborative and sustainable and therefore aligned to the requirements and expectations of Section 172.

As required by s172 of the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”), a director of a company must act in the way they consider, in good faith,
would most likely promote the success of the company for the benefit of its shareholders. In so doing, the director must have regards,
amongst other matters, to the:

    - likely consequences of any decision in the long term;

    - interests of the company’s employees;

    - need to foster the company’s business relationships with suppliers, customers and others;

    - impact of the company’s actions on the community and environment;

    - desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and

    - need to act fairly between members of the Company.

Each of the directors acknowledges their responsibility to promote the success of the company for its shareholders having regard for the
interests of other stakeholders in the group and the wider community. The following table identifies where in this annual report the Board
has considered our stakeholders in key decision-making in compliance with s172 of the Act:

**Environmental Performance**

**Environmental Management**

Keepmoat Homes operations are certified to our ISO 14001:2015 management system, ensuring contemporary systems and effective
controls are in place for all environmental risks and opportunities.

**_In the last year we have reduced the number of environmental incidents on Keepmoat sites by 11%, while increasing the_**
**_reporting of environmental hazards by 279%._**

This has been achieved through:

   - The enhancement of environmental controls in construction management systems and contractor trade specifications,
helping to ensure that our environmental standards are consistently implemented across all operations

   - In the context of the pandemic, the development and delivery of online environmental training, including briefings for
management teams and 20-minute environmental modules for construction teams

   - Refinement of the Health, Safety and Sustainability assurance regime to ensure that environmental hazards identified
receive appropriate focus.

**Affordable low carbon homes**

During 2020 we have started implementing low carbon technology and materials that facilitate comfortable and affordable low carbon
lifestyles on a larger scale, supporting our partners climate change commitments and helping customers reduced their carbon footprint.

Our approach focusses on green features across all scales from individual homes to landscape interventions. Two great examples of
this progressive approach in the South West are:

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

**Hartcliffe Campus**

During 2020, we started work on our Hartcliffe Campus development, a key part of the regeneration of South Bristol creating 350 new
homes in partnership with housing provider Live West.

   - Almost a third of the properties will be available through social rent or shared ownership schemes.

   - The development will include a variety of ecological features to support the local wildlife, including a wildflower ‘pollinator
park’, a wildlife corridor and 450 new trees.

   - Ground source heat pumps will provide all 350 homes with low carbon heating and hot water.

**Parklands Village**

A recently secured development, starting in 2021, Parklands Village will deliver 425 new high-quality homes in Weston-Super-Mare,
including

   - 30 per cent affordable housing

   - 85 adaptable or accessible homes, which will provide for people with mobility difficulties, or for those who develop them
during their lifetimes

   - 85% low carbon homes, being 60% better than Part L 2020 requirements

   - 15% (64) zero carbon homes

   - Electric vehicle charging to all homes.

Climate change adaptions across the site, creating green spaces that support wellbeing while also mitigating flooding and heat island
effects while supporting wildlife

**Waste & Recycling**

During the last year our focus has been on the prevention and avoidance of unnecessary waste through 2 key projects:

1 **Strategic waste partnerships with key national suppliers.**

      - Reducing costs per tonne by 3%

      - Maintaining landfill diversion rates at over 96%

      - Optimised skip utilisation through better segregation, increased inspections and reduced contamination

**2** **Optimising the implementation and use of Materials Management Plans**
Soils and demolition materials account for a large proportion of wastes on Keepmoat sites. To help prevent these materials
becoming waste we have:

      - Provided training to all operational teams to ensure consistent implementation.

      - Participated in the CIRIA Construction Soil Management Project with the aim of developing industry guidance and
good practice

**Environmental impact Statement**

The Group is continually striving to minimise its contribution to climate change in line with the UK Government’s commitment to achieve
net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In order to monitor our emissions, we capture data and report our carbon footprint, a measure of
our emissions of greenhouse gases. The Group is constantly analysing this data and we are committed to adapting the business, the
homes we build and the communities we work in to reduce our carbon emissions.

**Calculating emissions**

Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in alignment with records used for the production of the consolidated Financial Statements
for the relevant accounting period and are produced in accordance with The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology. We have used
emission factors from BEIS’s “Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2018, 2019 and 2020” to calculate our Scope 1 gas
emissions. We have determined the Scope 2 emissions for electricity using a combination of BEIS publication (for non-renewable energy)
and the Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) certificates provided by the suppliers for all renewable electricity. We have also
used the GHG Protocol Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, but we are not as yet able to report on all categories that may be relevant. All
emissions required under the Companies Act 2006 are included.

**Progress**

During the last financial year, the Group has embarked on various projects to reduce our energy consumption and carbon footprint. The
Group has delivered training to construction staff to improve energy efficiency and minimise vehicle idling and wherever feasible, propane
and butane heater use on site has been replaced with electric infrared heaters. This not only improves safety but, as they consume
renewable electricity, has reduced associated carbon emissions by 43% (88 tonnes). In addition, from January 2020 the electricity used
in our offices, compounds and plots has been sourced from a renewable electricity provider (REGO backed supply), reducing our carbon
emissions by 216 tonnes. This has led to a reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 (direct and indirect emissions) by 1,459 tonnes, a reduction
of 29%.

Despite this reduction, our emissions intensity ratio has increased to 9.5 from 8.2. This is due to a reduction in activity associated with
COVID-19 and the fact that much of our scope 1 and 2 emissions are not directly associated with construction activity.

The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the reduction in our scope 3 (value chain) carbon emissions. Following the introduction of
agile working being taken on by 70% of the Keepmoat Group’s staff, this has generated a saving in commuter miles of 28,000 each day.
The Group has also introduced low carbon concrete bricks to the construction of our homes, which produce 50% less carbon emissions.

**Future plans**

The pandemic has made it difficult to directly attribute the carbon reduction achieved this year to specific energy efficiency activity and
has led to delays in some initiatives until 2021. Going forward we are aiming to maximise the availability of electric vehicles, trial
alternatives for energy sources used on site and continue to integrate low carbon and climate resilient features to homes and
developments. Throughout the coming financial year, the Group intends to finalise our scope 3 emission baseline and set our sciencebased target aligned to the Paris Climate Change Agreement.

**Delivering social value**

We believe we have a clear responsibility to help deliver a sustainable future. For us this means delivering economic progress while
enhancing the environment and delivering social value.

We predominantly build affordable homes for first time buyers and social landlords. A key theme in our approach is to work with our
partners to deliver real and meaningful social and economic impact aligned to local community priorities. We call this the halo effect
where our activity helps address national societal challenges at a local level, such as providing business opportunities, increasing
household income, creating new green spaces, delivering construction skills and upgrading community infrastructure.

By its nature much of our social value activity is delivered through face to face interaction. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to
delay some activities and re-design others, e.g. moving to online formats. This has however only increased our motivation to be involved
in rebuilding and improving the lives of the communities at the heart of our developments.

**Find My Future**

Over the course of the pandemic we have had to change the way we work to keep our employees and communities safe. In recent
months we have been working with our partners to make the most of technology including:

Working with Salford City Council, Salix Homes and Galliford Try to coordinate an online Find My Future event.

The weeklong virtual event was aimed at 16 to 25-year olds who were invited to tune in to videos that partners had created, to open
their eyes to the variety of opportunities available in Salford to learn, gain experience and develop skills, from apprenticeships, to study
programmes and traineeships.

Keepmoat Homes and our partners took the lead on the Construction Industry sessions. The sessions included video clips about college
life, different types of construction, the different roles the construction industry has to offer and much more.

Over the full week, the sessions reached over 28,000 people, and had approximately 7,500 views.

**Newcastle Trinity Academy**

Working with Newcastle Trinity Academy over a 3-week period, we have supported students to better understand construction, and
engage with the industry and potential career opportunities.

Through a number of virtual sessions, Keepmoat helped the students, working in small teams, produce small, 10-unit, sustainable 3D
developments, culminating in the groups presenting their designs and ideas along with their calculations to show their profit margins.

_QUOTE from Sarah Butler- Employer Engagement Officer - Trinity Academy Newcastle_

_“I am thrilled with the support received by Keepmoat. Undertaking a variety of roles, the students were challenged with planning,_
_designing and constructing a development of 10 houses, giving students the opportunity to explore a range of careers within the industry,_
_helping to raise aspirations. The activity has provided the students with opportunities to develop a range of transferable skills including_
_problem solving, communication, negotiating, planning, and working to targets and deadlines whilst embedding English, Maths and ICT.”_

**Nottingham mentoring circle**

Working in partnership with the Department for Work and Pensions and Nottingham Jobs, we have been supporting local people in
Gedling through a Construction Mentoring programme.

The programme supports people who are interested in a career in construction with a variety of support to assist them with their career
development journey. The partnership has provided training to obtain a CSCS card, a two-week site-based work experience placement
at our Chase Farm development and ongoing employability support upon completion of the programme.

After launching the programme one local participant, having completed their work experience placement with Keepmoat Homes,
said:
_I would just like to start by saying thank you to Keepmoat Homes for allowing me to go onto the work experience and I learned a lot from_
_my mentor. The best part about the experience was meeting all the different trades and being able to ask them about their careers and,_
_following on from this, I’ve decided I want to learn a trade as the placement helped me realise what I want to do._

**Leeds skills hub (Timeless in Seacroft, Leeds)**

The skills hub, at our Timeless Development in Seacroft, Leeds, established as a temporary base in July 2019, has allowed us to
welcome over 490 students, aged 4 to 18, on to site to learn about the construction industry, develop their skills and take part in
workshops, taster sessions, work experience and apprenticeship opportunities.

A permanent facility will be launched in January 2021 with a classroom to learn theory, prepare for CSCS tests, mock interviews and
CV writing and with an outdoor learning space to develop practical skills through demonstrations from site management and
subcontractors.

The skills hub is open to everyone and we are working in partnership with Leeds City Council, local schools and colleges, HMP Leeds
Construction Academy and the Job Centre to ensure everyone can take advantage of the sessions and workshops on offer. From 2021,
the skills hub is forecast to support 600 students per academic year through various engagement opportunities.

**Doncaster flooding support**

As a major local business Keepmoat has worked to support victims of the 2019 Doncaster floods. We worked to target our support to
vulnerable residents who would have been left needing construction support.

Working with Doncaster College & OTE Construction Training we formed a partnership that could not only benefit local residents affected
by flooding but also provide much needed real-life site experience for young people undertaking construction training.

Over the course of the last year 10 uninsured properties of vulnerable residents have been fully refurbished, with Keepmoat and our
local suppliers providing all materials needed for the Construction trainees to complete the works.

During the project planning for the work, Keepmoat was asked to step in at short notice to support a particularly vulnerable family where
the resident was going in to hospital for cancer treatment. Keepmoat brought in contractors to undertake flood resilience work to the
property and to provide materials to refurbish areas damaged by the flood.

**Adapting to our customers’ needs**

Supporting our local partners and customer needs is integral to Keepmoat’s way of working and to our vision. One example from 2020
that demonstrates our approach is the adaptation of one of our homes to support a disabled resident.

At Greenway Road in Speke we adapted a brand new four-bedroom home for a family to cater for the needs of their 10-year-old daughter,
who has Retts Syndrome and needs a wheelchair to get around.

The house has been built as part of South Liverpool Homes’ 118-home Greenway development, where they worked closely with
Keepmoat Homes and Liverpool City Council to provide a forever home for the family, with all the modern facilities and space needed
to make their life more comfortable and manageable for years to come.

The new home contains specially designed features to support the family in their daily routine, which includes a lift, a bathroom with a
lifting hoist to assist with bathing, a hoist in the bedroom, widened doors and easy access into the home and garden.

_Quote from the family… “Our new home is absolutely perfect for our family now. The lift means that my daughter will get some_
_independence back as she will be able to go to her bedroom without having to be carried. And the extra space is life changing too; the_
_kids have their own bedroom, and the widened doorways and lower access facilities will make life so much easier._

_“I feel like I now have a lovely, safe environment for me and our family and I can’t thank everyone who’s been involved enough.”_

**World of Work Programme – Leicester**

Working in partnership with Leicester City Council and Leicester College, Keepmoat has been supporting Level 1 Construction students
as part of Leicester College’s ‘World of Work (WOW) Experience Programme’.

Completed over one week, the programme provides students with the opportunity to develop key employability skills, learn more about
the construction industry and engage with local construction companies. This provides opportunities for lower level students and those
with additional needs to develop the skills and qualities employers are looking for including; self-confidence, resilience, problem solving
and a sense of community.

Construction is one of the country’s leading economic drivers, however the sector is facing a skills shortage. The WOW Experience
Programme provides a great opportunity for local students to meet with prospective employers and learn more about the variety of
career opportunities available.

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

**Safety, health and wellbeing**

**COVID-19**

Over the past 12 months and through the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained very focussed on the safety, health and wellbeing of
our staff, sub-contractor partners and customers. At the end of March, as a responsible business, we took the decision to close our
offices and sites, to ensure the safety of our people, customers and communities we work with.

Everyone’s health and safety has been our top priority throughout, and we have worked strictly in line with Government guidance and
industry best practice from the Construction Leadership Council (CLC) and Home Builders Federation (HBF). With the UK Government’s
encouragement to restart, we started planning our phased reopening, always prioritising people’s health and safety and not asking
anyone who is vulnerable or who felt unsafe to return to work.

As lockdown continued to be eased, we put plans in place to re-open our offices for people who are unable to work from home and for
essential face to face meetings. We re-opened our sales centres and show homes in mid-May on an appointment only basis (later in
Scotland) in line with Government & HBF advice and with all the safety measures and social distancing guidelines in place.

Throughout this period, we undertook:

- 1,249 COVID-19 inspections

- 14,704 COVID-19 inductions

covering all the controls in place specifically dealing with COVID-19 infection transfer, social distancing and hygiene.

**Health & Safety Performance**
We are committed to continually improving our processes and performance to ensure efficiency and optimal outcomes. Our HSS
management system and key processes such as the pre-qualification of sub-contractors, inductions, training, incident recording and
reporting are managed through contemporary platforms and technology. This has also proved invaluable in the fight against COVID-19,
preventing contact between people and reducing the risk of infection transfer.

As such, we continue to improve our performance, based against last year, across a number of Health and Safety KPIs including:

- Lost Time Injuries: down by 6%

- Utility strikes: down by 16%

- Director’s safety visits: increased by over 50%

**Enforcement Authority Intervention**

The Health & Safety Executive visited our sites unannounced on 3 sites compared to 8 last year and took no enforcement action. In
recognition of our performance we were awarded the Gold Award by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA).

 Strategic Report – Principal risks and uncertainties

In order that we can meet our strategic objectives, it is paramount that we are effectively managing risk and that mitigating processes
and controls are embedded. Our risk management framework considers strategic and operational risk throughout the business and
ensures we have sufficient controls and measures in place, or future planned actions, to bring residual risk to appropriate levels.

This year has tested the effectiveness of our risk management and increased the residual risk associated with some of our principal
risks and, whilst a global pandemic was not specifically called out in previous risk registers, its potential impacts and how we mitigate
them certainly were and this is reflected in the direction of travel of some of the risks identified below:

### Strategic Report – Chief Financial Officer’s review 

Our financial performance this year has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with delivery volumes significantly reduced and
margins eroded by programme disruption and the costs of operating with COVID-19 working practices and social-distancing. The
resilience of our multi-tenure partnership business model, the immediate action taken by the Board, our recent balance sheet
strengthening and our strong forward order book position us well to return to our planned growth in the medium term.

**Financial Performance**

The Group delivered a resilient performance in the year given that COVID-19 resulted in the suspension of activities at our sites and
sales offices from the start of April in line with the Government’s guidelines. The Group’s sites remained closed until the 11th May when
twenty-four sites were reopened with limited construction activities commencing on plots at an advanced stage of build, with a further
thirty-three sites opening during the month. By August we were operating on all our developments. Whilst we kept our sales centres
open virtually through the lockdown period, demonstrating the effectiveness of our digital sales capabilities, we nevertheless experienced
a reduced level of reservations during this period given that in person sales office and show home visits were not possible. Our sales
offices in England were reopened on the 29th May, with those in Scotland following on the 12th June.

Despite the impact of COVID-19, the Group delivered total completions of 2,460 homes in the year to 31 October 2020 (“FY20”), down
39.0% on the prior year (2019: 4,035 homes). As a result, revenue fell by 37.5% to £406.0m (2019: £649.8m). The average selling price
of completions increased by 2.5% to £165k (2019: £161k). Our delivery to Registered Providers & the Private Rented Sector made up
30.3% of the Group’s volume (2019: 33.8%) reflecting the focus on our mixed tenure partnership model and providing resilience in the
long term.

Our contribution reduced by £54.9m to £64.7m (2019: £119.6m) with the decline primarily reflecting the reduction in completion volumes,
and COVID-19 related costs, including disruption to site build programmes, site overhead inefficiency during remobilisation, and
increased provisions in relation to pre-development work in progress on a limited number of sites, reflecting the evolving risk profile in
the wider market.

This year we delivered an adjusted EBIT of £11.4m (2019: £61.1m) largely as a result of the COVID-19 impact on both volumes and
costs. The Group’s adjusted EBIT margin reduced to 2.8% (2019: 9.4%) reflecting the lower contribution margin and the non-recurring
impact of non-productive site overhead costs of £5.7m that would normally be capitalised to WIP which were instead expensed during
the period of lockdown. These effects were partially mitigated through receipt of £3.5m of grants from the Governments CJRS for those
employees furloughed during the period of the temporary closure of the Group’s operations and the effect of COVID-19 on the Group’s
discretionary annual bonus schemes for which nothing was payable for this financial year.

Net financing costs at £25.5m were £3.4m higher than the prior year due to the levels of borrowing during the year and the cost of
increasing our facilities. As a result, the Group delivered a loss before tax of £18.0m (2019: profit before tax £37.2m) for the year.

In order to provide clearer visibility of the underlying performance of the Group, the Board elect to measure profits on an adjusted basis
alongside other key KPIs as follows:


**Year ended**
**31 October**
**2020**

### Strategic Report – Chief Financial Officer’s review 

**Exceptional Items**

During the year the Group announced a restructuring exercise to streamline the Group’s regional operations at a cost of £1.3m. As part
of this exercise the Group’s North West regional presence was consolidated into a single regional office and the South West office will
now operate as a satellite to the West Midlands region. Aligned with these regional changes, the business has simplified its divisional
structure with the regions now reporting through two Divisions covering the North & South of the UK. Exceptional restructuring costs
relate to redundancy costs and other costs associated with these actions.

During the year ended 31 October 2020, the Group incurred professional advisor costs of £0.5m relating to refinancing and corporate
finance matters.

**Cashflow and Financial Position**

At 31 October 2020 the Group had net assets of £97.3m (2019: £103.7m) a decrease of 6.2% (£6.4m) compared to the prior year.

Inventories have increased by 14.4% to £466.8m (2019: £407.9m), primarily as a result of additional inventory carried at year end arising
from the delayed completion of homes due to construction delays caused COVID-19. Land inventory represents approximately half of
the inventory balance (2019: approximately half).

The Group was cash generative, with £38.8m generated from operations before tax (12 months to 31 October 2019: inflow £44.7m) after
releasing £26.5m from working capital in the year, with the Group ending the year with net cash (including bank overdrafts) of £56.8m
(2019: £35.2m).

**Financing through the COVID-19 Period**

In response to the emergence of COVID-19 and the decision to close our sites, sales offices and show homes in April, the Group took
immediate action to preserve cash in the business, prudently managing the Group’s liquidity position. These actions included a reduction
in pay of 20% for the Group’s Executive board, Regional Directors and Senior Leaders in the business for a period whilst our sites
remained closed. We also negotiated an increase of the Group’s senior term loan and super senior revolving credit facility, which
alongside a further capital investment from the Group’s shareholders ensure the strong liquidity of the Group and evidence the good
relationships that Keepmoat Homes has with its banking partners.

The components of the increased facilities and capital investments were secured in the following tranches:

On 18 March 2020, the Group increased its super senior revolving credit facility by £5.0m, bringing the total limit to £60.0m. The terms
of the additional limit are in line with the existing facility.

On the 12 June 2020, the Group signed agreements to increase its super senior revolving credit facility by a further £15.0m, bringing
the total limit to £75.0m, this £15.0m facility matures on 12 December 2021. On the same day the Group entered into an agreement to
increase its existing term loan facility by £7.5m on the same terms as the existing facility. This brings the total term loan facility to
£157.5m. On the 3 July 2020, the Group drew down on the £7.5m term loan and the £15.0m of super senior revolving credit facility
became available to the Group.

The Group incurred and capitalised total issue costs of £1.25m as a result of increasing the two existing debt facilities.

On 15 June 2020, the Group also received £7.5m of additional funding from its shareholders in the form of the purchase of shares in
Keystone JVCo Limited, the company's ultimate parent undertaking. The purchase was split in proportion to the existing ownership of
the Group's shareholders.

**Financing costs**

External financing costs in the period were £26.2m (year ended 31 October 2019: £22.5m) leading to a cash outflow of £13.6m (year
ended 31 October 2019: £12.5m). The charge includes non-cash amounts of £8.3m (year ended 31 October 2019: £6.8m) in respect of
the unwind of discount on deferred land payments.

**Taxation**

The current period tax credit of £4.8m (year ended 31 October 2019: £6.9m charge) is made up of a current tax credit of £0.4m and a
deferred tax credit of £4.4m.

**Working capital**

The amount of working capital required to service the Group’s operations is closely monitored and controlled and forms a key part of the
management information reviewed on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Current assets mainly comprise trade receivables, work in
progress and land held for the development of private housing and affordable housing through partnership schemes. As the Group’s
trade receivables relate mainly to public sector and Housing Association clients, there is no significant history of bad or doubtful debts.

### Strategic Report – Chief Financial Officer’s review 

**Performance bond facilities**

The Group, like most construction businesses, may in some cases rely on the use of performance bonds issued by surety companies
to our clients. The directors are pleased to report that the Group has adequate performance bonding lines in place with surety companies
to meet the Group’s growth plans.

**Land bank pipeline**

At 31 October 2020, the number of plots within our land pipeline, including sites where we have been appointed as preferred developer
was over 24,000 representing over 6 years of delivery at current volumes, providing significant forward visibility for the Group.

**Impact of new accounting standards**

IFRS 16 “Leases” was effective for the year ended 31 October 2020. The impact of adopting this standard was the recognition of right
of use assets of £8.0m and lease liabilities of £8.6m on transition in respect of offices, company vehicles, site plant equipment and show
homes. The impact on adjusted EBIT for the year ended 31 October 2020 was £0.6m.

### Directors’ Report

The directors present their annual report and the consolidated audited financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 October
2020.

**Principal activities**

Keystone Midco Limited is an investment holding company heading a group of companies, which are engaged in the construction of
residential dwellings and associated development contracts.

The Company’s subsidiaries are listed in note 21 to the financial statements.

**Business review and future developments**

The consolidated loss for the financial year was £13.3m, (year ended 31 October 2019 profit of: £30.3m). The Company did not pay a
dividend during the year (year ended 31 October 2019: £nil), no final dividend is proposed (year ended 31 October 2019: £nil). A review
of the results, performance and future developments for the Group are presented in the Strategic Report on pages 3 to 29 which forms
part of this report.

**Post balance sheet events**

On 11 December 2020 Castle 1 Limited, a Keystone Midco Limited subsidiary, acquired BDW Trading Limited's 50% members' capital
holding in BK Scotswood LLP for £2.0m.

**Going concern**

The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, are set out in the Strategic Report on
pages 3 to 29. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and borrowing facilities are described on pages 27 to 29 of the Strategic
Report.

Having considered the Group’s forecasts including its forecast cashflows, the directors are satisfied that the Company has sufficient
liquidity and covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct its activities and meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable
future being at least twelve months. Accordingly, these financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis.

Further details of the Directors’ assessment of going concern can be found in the principal accounting policies on pages 38-39.

**Financial risk management**

In the course of its ordinary activities, the Group is exposed to financial risks which include liquidity, credit and interest rate risks. These
risks are monitored and managed through robust policies and procedures. Further details are included in Note 20 of the financial
statements.

Liquidity risk relates to the Group generating sufficient cash flow to meet its operational requirements while avoiding debt covenant
breaches or excessive debt levels. Total borrowings are a combination of long-term loans and long term committed revolving working
capital credit facilities.

Credit risk is in relation to trade receivables from customers. Given that the majority of trade receivables are with public and regulated
organisations, the exposure to credit risk is very limited.

Interest rate risk relates to the impact of interest rate increases on the Group’s floating rate borrowings. Following the Group’s refinancing
over the last financial year, the Group’s term loan, revolving credit and overdraft facilities are all on floating rates. The Group’s interest
rate risk has increased following completion of refinancing.

### Directors’ Report

**Directors’ indemnities**

The Group maintains liability insurance for its directors and officers which remains in place up to the date of this Annual Report. The
Group has also provided an indemnity for its directors, which is a qualifying third-party indemnity provision for the purposes of the
Companies Act 2006.

**Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements**

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulation.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared
the group financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 and company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law).

Under company law, directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the group and company and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing the financial statements,
the directors are required to:

   - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

   - state whether international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 have been
followed for the group financial statements and, and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 have been
followed for the company financial statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
statements;

   - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

   - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and company
will continue in business.

The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the group’s and company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and company and enable them to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

**Directors’ confirmations**

In the case of each director in office at the date the directors’ report is approved:

   - so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the group’s and company’s auditors are unaware;
and

   - they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the group’s and company’s auditors are aware of that information.

**Walker Guidelines**

The directors consider the annual report and financial statements to comply with all aspects of the guidelines for transparency and
disclosure in private equity owned companies.

**Independent auditors**

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office.

Approved by and signed on behalf of the Board.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited

# Report on the audit of the financial statements

**Opinion**

In our opinion:

  - Keystone Midco Limited’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the “financial
statements”) give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 October
2020 and of the group’s loss and cash flows for the year then ended;

  - the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting
standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006;

  - the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced
Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and

  - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Financial Statements (the “Annual
Report”), which comprise: the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 October 2020; the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the consolidated and company
statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; the principal consolidated accounting policies and the principal
company accounting policies; and the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the company
financial statements.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

_Independence_

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you
where:

  - the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not
appropriate; or

  - the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast
significant doubt about the group’s and company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised
for issue.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the
group’s and company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and
our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material
inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material
misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report
that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us
also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited

_Strategic Report and Directors’ Report_

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report
and Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 October 2020 is consistent with the financial statements and has been
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements_

As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements, the
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

_Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

_Use of this report_

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions,
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose
hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

# Other required reporting

**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

  - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

  - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or

  - certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

  - the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020

**General information**

Keystone Midco Limited (the Company) is a private limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of the registered
office is Keystone Midco Limited, The Waterfront, Lakeside Boulevard, Doncaster, DN4 5PL. The nature of the Group’s operations and
its principal activities are set out in the directors’ report.

The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because the Group operates exclusively in the United Kingdom. All financial
information is rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except where otherwise indicated.

**Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for assets and liabilities recognised at fair
value through profit or loss which have are stated at fair value.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements have been consistently applied
to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.

**Going concern**

Keystone Midco Limited (the “Company” and the “Keystone Midco Group”) is a holding company and heads up a sub-group within the
group headed by Keystone JVco Limited. Management have assessed going concern on a wider group basis as follows.

At 31 October 2020, the wider group owned by Keystone JVco Limited (the “Keepmoat Group” or “Group”) held cash and cash
equivalents of £56.8m and total loans and borrowings of £165.2m, which consisted of £0.3m of overdraft, bank and other loans of £11.6m
and £157.5m of term loan facility that matures in December 2024. Should further funding be required, the Group has a committed £75m
RCF (of which £0.2m was utilised at 31 October 2020), subject to compliance with certain financial covenants, of which £15.0m matures
in December 2021 and £60.0m matures in June 2024.

As such, in consideration of its net current assets of £315.0m, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet
its current liabilities and working capital requirements.

The performance of the Group is dependent upon a number of external factors and the wider macro-economic environment in which it
operates. The factors that particularly affect the performance of the Group are described in the strategic report (pages 3-21), with the
principle risks and uncertainties that may impact the Group outlined (pages 22-26). The material factors that may affect the future
financial performance of the Group include flat or negative economic growth, buyer confidence, mortgage availability and affordability,
new housing supply, falls in house prices or land values and the cost and availability of materials, subcontractors and suppliers.

The COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to an increase in the inherent uncertainty in the Group’s assessment of these factors. Since the restart of construction and sales activity in May 2020 post lockdown, the UK housing market has seen strong demand with reservations
and sales recovering to pre-lockdown levels, and the Group’s construction activity has returned to normal levels and delivery has been
aligned to demand accordingly. However, the outlook for the economy remains unclear: unemployment is expected to rise when the
Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme comes to an end in April 2021 and market activity could be affected by the impact of
the UK’s new post Brexit trading relationship with the EU. Future outbreaks of COVID-19 and consequent local or national restrictions
may cause further disruption to the Group’s activities.

The Group has extended its existing super senior revolving credit and fixed term debt facilities by £27.5m during the year to 31 October
2020. Furthermore, the Group received £7.5m of capital investment from its shareholders in July 2020. Under the extension of the super
senior revolving credit facility, the Group was bound to a new covenant requiring a minimum of £20m of available liquidity at each month
end and £30m of available liquidity at the end of each quarter. This covenant applies from July 2020 until December 2021.

The Group’s financial forecasts reflect the Directors considered view of expected performance, based on the information available at the
date of signing of these Financial Statements. This includes the ongoing costs of COVID-19 safe working practices implemented by the
Group.

To assess the Group’s resilience to adverse trading conditions, its financial forecast has been sensitised through a series of scenarios
reflecting the principal downside risks for the UK economy and housing market. The scenarios reflect potential downside risks as
presented in the latest available external economic forecasts.

This exercise included an aggregated reasonable worst-case scenario reflecting a manifestation of the principal risks to a severe but
plausible level. This scenario assumed that sales volumes and average selling prices fall below the Group’s forecast levels by 20% and
7.5% respectively, and that the Group’s operations are temporarily disrupted for three months due to a national response to a resurgence
of the virus.

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020

**Going concern (continued)**

The effects were modelled over a 15-month period, alongside reasonable mitigation that the Group would expect to undertake in such
circumstances, primarily a reduction in investment in inventories in line with the fall in expected sales and the actions successfully
deployed during the Group’s closure of its operations in March 2020. The effects have been modelled without assumption of Government
assistance during this period. The Directors have taken into their considerations the national restrictions currently in place at the date in
February 2021. In all scenarios, including the reasonable worst case, the Group is able to comply with its financial covenants, operate
within its current facilities, and meet its liabilities as they fall due.

Accordingly, the Directors consider there to be no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
to operate as a going concern. They have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group, and Company
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date of
signing of these Financial Statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of these
Financial Statements.

**Adoption of IFRS 16**

IFRS 16 is a new accounting standard that is effective for the year ended 31 October 2020. The Group have applied IFRS 16 at 1
November 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, comparative information is not restated and the
cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 is recognised in retained earnings at the date of initial application. Refer to the accounting
policy for leases for details of the different accounting policies applied in each financial period. See note 24 for details of the impact of
IFRS 16 at 1 November 2019.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Keystone Midco Limited, its subsidiary undertakings and the Group’s share of
the results of joint ventures and associates.

(a) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date
that control ceases.

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary
is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred, and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of
the acquiree. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed in administrative costs as incurred. All identifiable assets and liabilities acquired,
and contingent liabilities assumed are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest as compared with the Group’s share of the
identifiable net assets are recognised as goodwill. Where the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the total
consideration transferred, a gain from a bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the income statement after the fair values initially
determined have been reassessed.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised
losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Accounting
policies of acquired subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with accounting policies adopted by the Group.

(b) Joint ventures

Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, interest in joint ventures is initially
recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in
other comprehensive income.

Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds its equity accounted investment in a joint venture, the carrying amount of the equity interest
is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive
obligations. Appropriate adjustment is made to the results of joint ventures where material differences exist between a joint venture’s
accounting policies and those of the Group.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is impaired.
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of the impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate
and its carrying value and recognises the amount in the income statement adjacent to its share of profit/(loss) from associates.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint
ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

39


-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020

**Basis of consolidation (continued)**

(c) Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method, applying the same
policy as set out for joint ventures above.

**Segmental reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The
chief operating decision maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments has
been identified as Keepmoat Group’s executive directors.

**Revenue and profit recognition**

Revenue is recognised based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This can lead to
differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. Primarily, for those sites in
respect of which stage payments are received from registered providers for the provision of housing or where the Group undertakes
development contracts, revenue is recognised based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. The directors consider the
provision of land and residential properties to represent a single performance obligation which represents a judgement taken in the
application of IFRS 15.

_Sale of housing to open market customers_

Revenue and profits associated with the sale of housing to private open market customers are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income on legal completion.

Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable on legal
completion. Open market sale plots are recognised at the agreed sales price deemed to be fair value.

In certain instances, property may be accepted in part consideration for a sale of a residential property. The fair value established is
reduced for estimated costs to sell. Net sale proceeds generated from the subsequent sale of part exchange properties are recorded as
an adjustment to cost of sales. The original sale is recorded in the normal way, with the fair value of the exchanged property replacing
cash receipts. Part exchange properties are held within Inventories at net realisable value until subsequent sale.

_Sale of housing to registered provider customers and associated development contracts with stage payments_

The Group constructs and sells residential properties and undertakes associated development activities under long-term contracts with
customers. Such contracts are entered into before construction of residential properties or associated development activities begin.
Under the terms of the contracts, the Group is continually restricted from redirecting the properties or development works to another
customer and has an enforceable right to payment for work done. Revenue from construction of residential properties and associated
development activities is therefore recognised over time based on a certified monthly valuation of work performed or the assessed
physical stage of completion at the balance sheet date. The directors consider that this method is an appropriate measure of the progress
towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations under IFRS 15.

On the balance sheet, the Group reports the net contract position for each contract as either an asset or a liability. A contract represents
an asset where costs incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses) exceed progress billings; a contract represents a liability
where the opposite is the case.

_Sale of housing to registered provider customers without stage payments_

Revenue and profits associated with these activities are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on legal completion as
this is the point at which control is passed from the Group to the purchaser.

_Profit recognition_

Gross profit is recognised for all house sales (to open market customer and to registered providers) and associated development
activities, when the related revenue is recognised in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy, based on the latest forecast
for the gross margin expected to be generated over the life of the development or phase of the development. The expected gross margin
to be generated from each development is calculated as an output of a development valuation completed using latest selling prices and
forecasts of all land and construction costs associated with that development. The application of a whole site margin to determine
development profitability is a judgement taken in the application of IFRS 15.

The estimation methodology used to determine the gross profit margin recognised on each development was refined during the year,
this change in methodology did not have a material effect on the gross profit recognised in the year, of £64.8m.

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of
the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the
significance of their nature or amount.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of
the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired at the acquisition date. It is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment
at least annually or when there is a triggering event, by considering the net present value of future cash flows. For the purposes of
testing for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the value in use and
the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement.

Where the fair value of the consideration given is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired, the
difference is immediately recognised in the income statement as a gain from a bargain purchase.

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating
units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.

**Intangible assets**

Other intangible assets, such as those identified on acquisition by the Group that have finite lives, are recognised at fair value and
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

Intangible assets are being amortised over the following periods, with amortisation being charged to cost of sales unless otherwise
stated:

- Contracted customer relationships – in line with expected profit generation, over a term of seven years

- Land development rights – in line with expected profit generation, varying from one to twenty years

- Computer software – on a straight-line basis over three years. (Amortisation expense is included in administrative expenses)

Intangible assets with a finite useful economic useful life are tested for impairment when there is an indication that the intangible asset
may be impaired.

**Research and development**

Research and development activities are typically self-initiated in nature. Costs for self-initiated research and development activities are
assessed to determine if they qualify for recognition as internally generated intangible assets based on the following criteria:

  - It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use;

  - Management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

  - There is an ability to sell the intangible asset;

  - It can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;

  - Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible are available;

  - The expenditure attributable to the intangible during its development can be reliably measured.

Further to meeting these criteria, only such costs that relate solely to the development phase of a self-initiated project are capitalised,
this includes the capitalisation of labour costs associated with the development phase.

Any costs incurred as part of the research phase and any other development expenditures which do not satisfy the criteria are expensed
as incurred.

**Property, plant and equipment**

All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.

The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Depreciation is calculated
so as to write off the cost of each asset, less their estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic
lives, or until the date of disposal.

The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:

Leasehold property improvements over the lease term

Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings 10 – 50%

No depreciation is provided on freehold land

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method, less loss allowance. The loss allowance is calculated based on historic loss rates from payment profiles of sales in prior periods.
The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the debtor’s
ability to settle the receivable.

In respect of accounting for trade and other receivables, the Group has applied IFRS 9’s simplified approach to provisioning and has
calculated this using lifetime expected losses.

When a trade receivable is wholly or partially uncollectible, any uncollectible amount is written off against the loss allowance. Subsequent
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the loss allowance. Changes in the carrying amount of the loss
allowance are recognised in the income statement.

**Impairment of financial assets**

IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model requiring the assessment of the expected credit loss on each class of financial asset at
each reporting date. This includes trade receivables, amounts due from related party undertakings, other receivables and contract
assets. This assessment takes into consideration changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset.

**Inventories**

Inventories are held at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Costs comprise land, materials, applicable direct labour and those
overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the
estimated selling price less all estimated costs to sell, including sales and marketing costs.

Land held for development and land under development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost
including cost directly attributable to enhancing the land value along with any expected overage. Where land is purchased on deferred
payment terms, the liability is discounted to fair value with the land recognised at the discounted value in inventories. The liability is
presented as “development land payables” within trade and other payables. Also included within land inventories is land where the
Group has the right to develop through a build lease.

Pre-contract development expenditure is capitalised into inventories where it is probable that a site will be contracted for development.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these pre-contact development inventories, and provision made to reflect
any irrecoverable element. The impairment reviews consider the likelihood of the development being viable to proceed including the
securing of residential planning consent.

Part exchange properties are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value and include a carrying value provision to cover the costs
of management and resale. Any profit or loss on the disposal of part exchange properties is recognised within cost of sales in the
statement of comprehensive income

**Cash and cash equivalents**

In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand. Bank overdrafts are also included, as
they are an integral part of the Group’s cash management. In the consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within
borrowings in current liabilities.

**Restricted cash**

Financial assets include cash receipts related to certain developments held in development specific bank accounts over which third
parties hold a charge and joint mandate. The cash in these accounts can be used to finance the investment of work in progress in the
specific development to which it relates and become unrestricted on the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent in accordance with
the terms of loans or other contractual arrangements relating to the development.

42

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020

**Trade payables**

Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms,
particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate and subsequently
held at amortised cost. The discount to the nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs
using the effective interest rate. Changes in estimates of the final payment due are taken to inventory (land held for and under
development) and in due course, to cost of sales in the income statement.

Trade payables also includes overage payable where the Group is committed to make contractual payments to land vendors related to
the performance of the relevant development in the future. Overage payable is estimated based on expected future cash flows in relation
to relevant developments and, where payment will take place in more than one year, is discounted.

**Loans and borrowings**

Interest bearing bank loans, term loans, senior secured notes and other borrowings are recorded initially at their fair value, net of direct
transaction and debt issue costs.

Such instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, including commitment fees, arrangement fees
and any other costs directly related to the borrowings are recognised over the term of the instrument using the effective rate of interest.

Any instrument repaid before the end of the contractual term will result in any unamortised costs being immediately recognised in the
income statement.

**Leases**

_Accounting policy applied until 31 October 2019 (IAS 17)_

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

The Group rents surplus property under short and medium-term arrangements. Income is recognised over the period of lease when the
Group can reliably measure likely flow of economic benefits. These are treated as operating lease arrangements.

_Accounting policy applied from 1 November 2019 (IFRS 16)_

The Group leases various show home properties, office space, cars and plant hire used in construction and development. Rental
contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 6 months to 14 years but may have extension options.

Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and
non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, for leases of real estate for which the Group is a lessee and
for which it has major leases, it has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead accounts for these as a single
lease component.

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do
not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be
used as security for borrowing purposes.

Prior to 1 January 2019, leases of property, plant and equipment were classified as either finance leases or operating leases. For
financial periods commencing from 1 January 2019, leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the
date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value
of the following lease payments:

- Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

- Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;

- Amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;

- The exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and

- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is
generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee
would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic
environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020

**Leases (continued)**

The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the
lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is
reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so
as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

 - The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;

 - Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;

 - Any initial direct costs; and

 - Restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the
Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straightline basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise
IT equipment and some plant on hire.

Where the Group has acquired the right to develop land under a build lease the Groups interest in the land is held in inventory as a rightof-use asset. The corresponding lease liability is recognised in “development land payables” within trade and other payables and is
appropriately discounted.  There has been no change to the accounting treatment of these arrangements under IFRS16.

**Equity instruments**

Equity instruments such as ordinary share capital issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of directly
attributable incremental issue costs. Proceeds are allocated between nominal value and share premium.

**Income tax**

Income tax expense represents the current and deferred tax charges.

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.

Current tax is the Group’s expected tax liability on taxable profits for the year using tax rates substantively enacted at the reporting date
and any adjustment to tax in respect of previous years. Where current tax losses are available but not utilised in the period, a deferred
tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is considered recoverable.

Taxable profit differs from that reported in the income statement because it is adjusted for items of income or expense that are assessable
or deductible in other years or are never assessable or deductible.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax rates used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance
sheet liability method.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised in full if future taxable
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if
the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination)
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are only offset to the extent that that there is a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax assets and liabilities.

**Government grants**

Government grants are recognised at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions
attaching to them and the grants will be received.

Grants related to assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and unwound over the useful lives of the related assets.

Grants related to income are included within deferred income and subsequently in the appropriate line within the Income Statement, in
line with the Group’s revenue recognition policy.

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020

**Retirement benefit obligations**

(a) Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as they accrue. Differences between contributions
payable in the year and contributions actually paid are included within either accruals or prepayments on the balance sheet. The position
at the end of the current and prior period was a prepayment.

(b) Contractual benefit obligations

The Group operates the Keepmoat Limited Group Pension Plan (“KPP”), a defined contribution plan, with assets held in independently
administered funds. Some members of the KPP have a contractual promise from the Group, which is separate to the benefits payable
by the KPP, being an arrangement between Keepmoat Limited and the applicable employees. The obligation arising under this
arrangement has been calculated by a qualified independent actuary and accounted for as a long-term employee benefit. The contractual
liabilities are measured using the projected unit actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality
corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.

Actuarial gains and losses of the contractual liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Gains
and losses arising on curtailment and settlements are taken to the income statement as incurred.

**Provisions**

Provisions for remedial contract obligations, vacant property obligations and restructuring costs are recognised when: the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation; and the amount has can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the
provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group’s management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised.

The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within
the next financial year are addressed below.

- **Estimation of development profitability**

The gross profit from revenue generated on each of the Group’s developments in a specific period is based on the latest forecast for the
whole site gross profit expected to be generated over the life of that development or phase. The expected gross profit is calculated as
an output of development valuations completed using latest selling prices and forecasts of all land and construction costs associated
with the development. These calculations of expected gross profits require a degree of estimation due to their long-term nature and are
sensitive to future movements in both the estimated cost to complete and expected selling prices.

Group’s management has established internal controls to regularly review and ensure the appropriateness of the forecasts and estimates
made on an individual development basis. However, a change in estimated gross profits over a number of developments (due, for
example, to changes in estimates of costs remaining or a reduction in average selling prices in the private market) could materially affect
profitability. As an illustration, a reasonably possible change in profits of 1% across all developments in the year to 31 October 2020
would have reduced gross profit and net assets by an estimated £4.1m.

**405,953** 649,808

During the year ended 31 October 2020 a misclassification in the prior year comparative has been identified in respect of £4.3m of
revenue that was incorrectly presented as open market and at a point in time and has now been corrected in the disclosure above as
development contract revenue recognised over time.

All revenue is generated in the United Kingdom. There are no single customers that account for 10% or more of the Group’s revenue.
Included within revenue is £1.6m (2019: £1.1m) relating to income from government grants.

At 31 October 2020, the aggregate amount of revenue allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations was £292.0m (31 October 2019:
£235.5m). Approximately sixty percent of these amounts will be recognised within one year with the remainder recognised over varying
contractual lengths.

Contract assets and liabilities are included within “trade and other receivables” and “trade and other payables” respectively on the face
of the balance sheet. Where there is a corresponding contract asset and liability in relation to the same contract, the balance shown is
the net position. The timing of work performed (and thus revenue recognised), billing profiles and cash collection, results in trade
receivables (amounts billed to date and unpaid), contract assets (unbilled amounts where revenue has been recognised) and customer
advances and deposits (contract liabilities), where no corresponding work has yet to be performed, being recognised on the Group’s
balance sheet.

**Onerous lease provision**

As part of the restructuring of the West Midlands region, during the year ended 31 March 2018 the Group made an onerous lease
provision in respect of the lease obligation for the regional office at Coleshill, which became surplus to ongoing operational requirements.
During the year ended 31 October 2019 the lease was reassigned, resulting in a release of the outstanding provision for future liability
and a credit to the income statement.

**Restructuring costs**

A regional and divisional restructuring exercise, including redundancies, was undertaken during the year ended 31 October 2020. As
part of this the North West regional presence was consolidated into a single regional office and the South West office will act as a satellite
to the West Midlands region. Aligned with these regional changes, the business has simplified its divisional structure with the regions
now reporting through two, North & South Divisions. Exceptional restructuring costs relate to redundancy costs and other costs
associated with these actions.

**Other costs**

During the year ended 31 October 2020, the Group incurred professional advisor costs relating to refinancing and corporate finance
matters.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses, corporate interest restriction and other temporary differences giving
rise to deferred tax assets, where it is probable that the assets will be recovered through trading and taxable profits. The directors have
assessed the carrying value of the deferred tax assets relating to losses and corporate interest restriction at the balance sheet date and
are of the opinion that they are supported by future forecast profits, notwithstanding current year losses generated.

A deferred tax asset amounting to £19,774,000 (31 October 2019: £18,245,000) in relation to certain losses within the Group has not
been recognised as the Directors are of the opinion that there is a doubt over the recoverability of this asset due to the level of taxable
profits in the relevant entities and the impact of the loss utilisation rules that were introduced from 1 April 2017.

Amortisation of contracted customer relationships and land development rights are included within cost of sales whilst amortisation of
computer software is included with administration expenses.

During the financial year it was noted that some IT software had historically been incorrectly disclosed as part of property, plant and
equipment. Therefore, the opening balance of cost and amortisation has been transferred to intangibles and the assets treated under
the correct classification for the year ended 31 October 2020.

**7** **Goodwill and other intangible assets**

**Impairment review of goodwill**

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications the goodwill might be impaired. In testing
goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the recoverable amount of the Group has been determined from value in use
calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the forecast revenue and profit, discount rates
and long-term growth rates by market sector. Future forecast revenue is based on management’s knowledge of actual results from prior
years and latest forecasts for the current year, along with secured works, management’s expectation of the future level of work available
within the market sector and expected changes in selling volumes and prices for completed houses. In establishing future profit margins,
the margins currently being achieved are considered in conjunction with expected inflation rates in each cost category and the current
market value of land being acquired.

Cash flows beyond the five-year plan period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% (31 October 2019: 2%) per annum.
The growth rate used is an estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the market sectors where the Group operates. A pre-tax
discount rate of 11.9% (31 October 2019: 10.7%) has been applied, being the estimated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for
current market conditions.

Following the UK’s exit from the European Union and the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has undertaken
a detailed exercise around assumptions used in the cash flows noted above and a sensitivity analysis on those cashflows. The sensitivity
analysis to changes in cashflow indicated head-room which was materially above the carrying value, so the directors are of the opinion
that no impairment of goodwill is required.

During the year ended 31 October 2020 it was noted that some IT software had been misclassified in the prior year disclosure within
property, plant and equipment. Therefore, the opening balance of cost and amortisation has been correctly reflected in intangible assets
and corrected in the comparative disclosure above and in Note 7.

There has been no impairment of property, plant and equipment during the year.

House building developments in progress **247,033** 207,939

**466,782** 407,887

The Group carries out a detailed annual review of the net realisable value of land held for and under development both relating to plots
currently in development, and land and phases of sites not yet in development.

Net realisable value for land where construction of homes had commenced at the year-end or is anticipated to commence within the
next 12 months was assessed by estimating selling prices and costs (including sales and marketing expenses) taking into account
current market conditions.

Land where house building had not commenced at the year-end and was more likely to be sold undeveloped is assessed by re-appraising
the land using current selling prices and costs for the proposed development and assuming an appropriate financial return to reflect the
current housing market conditions and the prevailing financing environment.

At the year-end, the net realisable value provision amounts to £nil (31 October 2019: £nil). This provision will be closely monitored for
adequacy and appropriateness as regards under and over provision to reflect circumstances at future balance sheet dates.

Government grants are recognised as deferred income and are allocated to the income statement over the useful lives of the related
assets. The effect of this treatment is to reduce the fair value of work in progress by £7,421,000 (31 October 2019: £11,665,000) and
to reduce cost of sales in the income statement by £1,379,000 (31 October 2019: £2,299,000).

Included within inventories are £0.2m of part exchange properties (31 October 2019: £0.3m). Part exchange properties of £2.1m (31
October 2019: £0.1m) were disposed of during the year for proceeds of £2.1m (31 October 2019: £0.1m).

The senior secured notes were redeemed at par on 11 December 2018, incurring no early repayment charges. On the same day the
Group issued a £150,000,000 term loan facility attracting interest of 6.5% plus Libor due for repayment on 11 December 2024.

On 11 December 2018, the Group repaid in full its £37,500,000 revolving credit facility. On the same day, the Group opened a new debt
facility in the form of a £27,500,000 revolving credit facility, of which £7,500,00 has been utilised at 31 October 2019. The new facility is
a super senior revolving credit facility with a limit of £27,500,000 due for renewal in June 2025 attracting interest at a rate of 3.0% plus
LIBOR. On the same day the Group repaid its overdraft and opened a new overdraft facility as part of the super senior revolving credit
facility giving a combined limit of £55,000,000. The new facility is secured via a floating charge over the assets of the Group Companies.

In the period ended 31 October 2019 the Group incurred and capitalised total issue costs of £8,300,000 as a result of issuing the two
new debt facilities.

On 18 March 2020, the Group increased its super senior revolving credit facility by £5,000,000, bringing the total limit to £60,000,000.
The terms of the additional limit are in line with the existing facility.

**15** **Loans and borrowings (continued)**

On the 12 June 2020, the Group signed agreements to increase its super senior revolving credit facility by a further £15,000,000, bringing
the total limit to £75,000,000. This £15,000,000 increased facility matures on 12 December 2021. On the same day the Group entered
into an agreement to increase its existing term loan facility by £7,500,000 on the same terms as the existing facility. This brings the total
term loan facility to £157,500,000. On the 3 July 2020, the Group drew down on the £7,500,000 term loan and the £15,000,000 of super
senior revolving credit facility became available to the Group.

In the period ended 31 October 2020 the Group incurred and capitalised total issue costs of £1,250,000 as a result of increasing the two
existing debt facilities

Other loans comprise Builders Finance Fund (“BFF”) loans from the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) and loans from the Greater
Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA). Interest is charged at European Central Bank base rate plus a margin which varies 4.5% to
6.5% between sites and amounts are repayable on completion of each site for which the loan relates.

The interest rate risk profile of the Group's financial liabilities at 31 October 2020 is below, which includes all drawn down borrowings.
This includes interest payable in each year until maturity as well as principal repayments. It is assumed that the London inter-banking
lending rate (LIBOR) remains constant at the year-end position.

The dilapidations provision covers the Group’s leased estate. A full provision up to the end of each lease was established by an
independent external valuer, with the element up to the date of the financial statements being recognised in the accounts on a pro-rated
straight-line basis.

**Other provisions**

Other provisions comprised redundancy provisions, legal fees in relation to claims and onerous lease provisions relating to the Group’s
leased estate.

As part of the restructuring of the West Midlands region, during the year ended 31 March 2018 the Group made an onerous lease
provision in respect of the lease obligation for the regional office at Coleshill, which became surplus to ongoing operational requirements.
During the year ended 31 October 2019 the lease was reassigned, resulting in a partial utilisation and release of the outstanding provision
for future liability.

**18** **Retirement benefit liabilities**

**Keepmoat Pension Plan**

The Group operates the Keepmoat Limited Group Pension Plan (“KPP”), a defined contribution plan, with assets held in independently
administered funds. Some members of the KPP have a contractual promise from the Group, which is separate to the benefits payable
by the KPP, being an arrangement between Keepmoat Limited and the applicable employees. The obligation arising under this
arrangement has been calculated by a qualified independent actuary and accounted for as a long-term employee benefit. The contractual
liabilities are measured using the projected unit actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality
corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.

The major assumptions used by the actuary to calculate the liabilities of the defined benefit obligation are:

**Defined contribution schemes**

The pension cost charged to the income statement in respect of the defined contribution scheme during the year was £1,773,000 (31
October 2019: £1,542,000) representing contributions payable in the year. Contributions due to the defined contribution schemes at the
period end were £136,089 (31 October 2019: £137,503).

**19** **Contingent liabilities**

The Group has entered into performance guarantees in the normal course of business which, at 31 October 2020, amounted to £22.7m
(31 October 2019: £14.0m). In the opinion of the directors, no loss will arise in respect of these guarantees.

The Group has given guarantees in respect of the bank borrowings in addition to performance and other guarantees. At 31 October
2020 the Group had bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility of £nil (31 October 2019: £7,500,000) and bank overdrafts of
£254,000 (31 October 2019: £6,311,000). The Group therefore had undrawn facilities totalling £74,746,000 (31 October 2019:
£41,189,000). The guarantees are in the form of floating charges over the assets of certain Group companies.

The Group is party to the Keystone Midco Limited Group (“Midco Group”) senior facility agreement whereby the Midco Group has a
revolving credit facility of £75,000,000. At 31 October 2020 the Midco Group was in a net cash position (31 October 2019: net cash
position).

**20** **Financial instruments**

**Capital risk management**

The Group’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders by ensuring that the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to sustain its present
and forecast operations.

The Group monitors current and forecast cash liquidity and bond liquidity against available facilities to ensure that there is sufficient
capacity to meet requirements for the foreseeable future.

As part of its covenants, the Group also measures its leverage requirement as a ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net debt. The leverage
covenant requirement reduces over time. At 31 October 2020, the ratio of 1.95 for the year was within the required ratio of 5.03 (at 31
October 2019, the ratio of 1.96 for the year was within the required ratio of 5.44).

**Financial risks and management**

The Group’s principal financial instruments comprised a term, RCF facility, bank loans, development land payables, subordinated
shareholder loan notes, and cash. The main purpose of these financial instruments and to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The
Group has other financial instruments including trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations.

No trading in financial instruments has been undertaken.

The Group has exposure to a variety of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. The Board reviews and agrees policies for
managing risk as well as specific policies and guidelines.

The key financial risks resulting from the Group’s use of financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.

**a)** **Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations mainly arising on the Group’s
trade receivables and amounts due from construction contract customers.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited for open market housebuilding activities as the Group typically receives cash at the point
of legal completion of its sales.

The credit risk on registered provider sales depends on the individual characteristics of the counterparty many of whom are in the public
sector or are funded by the public sector (e.g. housing associations). The Board consider that the credit rating of these customers is
good and the credit risk on outstanding balances to be low and no provision is held against these balances (31 October 2019: £nil).

The Group does not have any concentration of risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract receivables or trade receivable
balances, with receivables spread across a wide range of customers.

The ageing of trade receivables (see note 11) is as follows:

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2020

**20   Financial instruments (continued)**

The Group applies the simplified approach under IFRS 9 to measure expected credit losses (“ECL”) associated with trade and other
receivables. The carrying value of receivables is reduced at each reporting date for any increase in the lifetime ECL with an impairment
loss recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. The Directors are of the opinion that there is a significant concentration of
credit risk for those balances past due greater than 90 days. Trade receivables with a carrying amount of £1.8m (31 October 2019:
£10.5m) are past due at the reporting date and £0.2m are impaired (31 October 2019: £0.8m).

**b)** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. An ageing profile of the
Group’s loans and borrowings is presented in note 15.

The Group’s objective is to manage liquidity by ensuring that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they become
due. This will be assessed under normal and stress conditions, without incurring losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

Following securing additional financing the Group has increased its revolving credit facility to £75m, releasing a further £20m of liquidity.

The Group has rigorous cash management processes. Cash balances are reported daily with detailed analysis of variances to short
term cash forecasts. Short term cash forecasts are updated monthly and are for a period of 26 weeks with the first 8 weeks on a daily
basis and the remaining 18 weeks on a weekly basis. These complement a minimum of four long term quarterly cash forecasts each
year which are compared to the annual cash flow budget and to previous quarterly forecasts. These facilitate management’s
assessments of the Group’s expected cash performance and the associated comparison to available facilities and the Group’s
covenants.

Key risks to liquidity and cash balances are a decrease in the value of open market sales, a downturn in the UK housing market,
deterioration in credit terms obtainable in the market from suppliers and subcontractors, a downturn in the profitability of work, delayed
receipt of cash from customers and a general decline in the ability of local authorities to fund urban regeneration projects.

In order to mitigate this risk, the Group continually monitors open market house sales volumes and prices; working capital levels and
contract profitability; and both client and supplier credit references and credit terms with clients and suppliers to ensure they continue to
be appropriate.

The Group does not have any derivative financial liabilities.

**c)** **Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates, house prices and foreign exchange rates will affect the Group
income or the value of the Group’s financial instruments.

_Interest rate risk_

Interest rate risk relates to the impact of interest rate increases on the Group’s floating rate borrowing. Following the refinancing during
the year, the Group now holds facilities at floating interest rates at a margin over the London Interbank Borrowing Rate (LIBOR). This
new financing has increased the liquidity of the Group but also the Group’s exposure to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. Whilst the
risk of an increase in interest rate is beyond the Group’s control, management continually keeps this exposure under review.

_Housing market risk_

The Group is affected by price fluctuations in the UK housing market. The market is impacted by consumer demand and employment
levels and is dependent on the availability of mortgage finance. Furthermore, Government incentives, such as the “Help to Buy” scheme,
have helped to stimulate consumer demand. Whilst these risks are beyond the Group’s ultimate control, risk is spread across differing
business activities undertaken by the Group and the geographical regions in which it operates.

_Currency risk_

The Group operates entirely in the United Kingdom and all of the Group’s revenue is generated in the United Kingdom and is
denominated in pounds sterling. Consequently, the Group has very limited exposure to currency risk

**Fair values of financial instruments**

_Trade and other receivables_

The fair value of trade and other receivables, excluding contract assets, is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted
at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material. The carrying amount of trade and other receivables is a
reasonable approximation of their fair value.

_Trade and other payables_

The fair value of trade and other payables, excluding contract liabilities, is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted
at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material. The carrying amount of trade and other payables is a
reasonable approximation of their fair value.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated at its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand.

_Loans and borrowings_

Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest
at the balance sheet date.

Prepayments and contract assets are excluded from the trade and other receivables balances. Contract liabilities, non-cash land
commitments and statutory liabilities are excluded from trade and other payables as these are not financial instruments.

_Borrowing facilities_

At 31 October 2020, the Group had committed borrowing facilities totalling £75,000,000 (31 October 2019: £55,000,000) representing
revolving credit facilities and overdraft, which are due for renewal in June 2025. At 31 October 2020 the Group had bank borrowings
under the revolving credit facility of £nil (31 October 2019: £7,500,000) and bank overdrafts of £254,000 (31 October 2019: £6,311,000).
The Group therefore had undrawn facilities totalling £74,746,000 (31 October 2019: £41,189,000). Revolving credit facilities bear interest
at 3.25% over LIBOR whilst cash overdrafts are 3.25% over Bank of England base rate.

The directors regard Keystone Topco Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, as the Company’s immediate parent
company and Keystone JVco Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, as the Company’s ultimate UK based parent
company.

Keystone Midco Limited is the owner of the smallest group and Keystone JVco Limited is the owner of the largest group in which these
results are consolidated.

The Company’s ultimate parent company is Cotton Holding S.à.r.l., a company incorporated in Luxembourg, whilst the Company’s
ultimate controlling party is TDR Capital LLP through investment funds under their management.

The consolidated financial statements of Keystone JVco Limited may be obtained from Keepmoat Limited, The Waterfront, Lakeside
Boulevard, Doncaster, DN4 5PL

**24** **Adoption of IFRS 16**

As indicated in accounting policies and note 14 the Group has adopted IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from 1 November 2019 but has
not restated comparatives for the year to 31 October 2019, as permitted under the specific transition provisions in the standard. The
reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are therefore recognised in the opening balance sheet on 1
November 2019.

On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as operating
leases under the principles of IAS 17 Leases. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments,
discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of 1 November 2019. The weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing
rate applied to the lease liabilities on 1 November 2019 varied depending on asset type and length of lease.

In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:

  - Applying a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;

  - Relying on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous as an alternative to performing an impairment review – there
were no onerous contracts as at 1 November 2019;

  - Accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 November 2019 as short-term
leases;

  - Excluding initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application; and

  - Using hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.

The Group has also elected not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease at the date of initial application. Instead, for
contracts entered into before the transition date the Group relied on its assessment made applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 Determining
whether an Arrangement contains a Lease.

The associated right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on a retrospective basis as if the new rules had always been
applied. Other right-of use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or
accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the balance sheet as at 31 October 2019.

The following is a reconciliation of total operating lease commitments at 31 October 2019 (as disclosed in the financial statements to 31
October 2019) to the lease liabilities recognised at 1 November 2019:

**£’000s**

**Total operating lease commitments disclosed at 31 October 2019** **9,717**

(Less) short-term leases not recognised as a liability (339)

Adjustments as a result of extension and termination options 1,331

**Operating lease liabilities before discounting** **10,709**

Discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of application (2,111)

**Lease liability recognised as at 1 November 2019** **8,598**

Of which are:

Current lease liability 2,562

Non-current lease liability 6,036

**8,598**

### Principal company accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2020

**Basis of preparation**

The Company financial statements of Keystone Midco Limited have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (“FRS 101”) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost
convention except investment property which have been measured at fair value.

The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. All financial information is rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except
where otherwise indicated. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements have been
consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.

FRS 101 allows the income statement and balance sheet to be presented in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1

- Presentation of Financial Statements.

A summary of the disclosure exemptions adopted for the year ended 31 October 2020 is presented below. Equivalent disclosures for
financial instruments are included in the Keepmoat Midco Limited Group consolidated financial statements allowing the exemptions to
be applied.

**Area** **Disclosure exemption**

Cash flow statements Exemption from preparing a cash flow statement. (IAS 7)

Financial instrument Exemption from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments) and related IFRS
disclosures 13 disclosures.

Exemption from the disclosures in respect of management’s objectives, policies and processes
for managing capital (IAS1.134 to 136).

Related party disclosures Exemption for related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group,
provided that any subsidiary which is party to a transaction is wholly owned by such a member.

Exemption from disclosure of key management personnel compensation.

Presentation of Financial Exemption from statement of compliance with IFRS, cash flow information and capital
Statements management policy.

The Company has consistently and uniformly applied the accounting policies of the Group set out on pages 38 to 45 insofar as they are
applicable to the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and subject to the disclosure exemptions above.

**Investments**

Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are recorded in the Company’s balance sheet at cost less any impairment.
The directors review the investments for impairment when there are indicators of possible impairment.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Company’s management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.

**Impairment of investments and inter-company receivables**

Determining whether investments and inter-company receivables are impaired requires an estimate of the future discounted cash flows
of each investment or receivable. Discounted cash flows and assumptions (including discount rates, timing of cash flows and growth
prospects) are inherently subjective and largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Company.

### Strategic Report 

 Chairman’s Statement

I am delighted to have joined Keepmoat Homes as Chairman following a very successful period for the Group. Keepmoat Homes is an
excellent business and, importantly, it is a different type of home builder which is uniquely placed to serve the needs of the UK today. It
is the UK’s largest dedicated partnership home builder focused on building sustainable communities. Keepmoat is committed to putting
customers first delivering high quality affordable homes, using a mix of tenures across the country.

One of Keepmoat’s defining features is its quality product at affordable prices. With an average selling price of £161,000, Keepmoat
helps customers achieve their aspirations of owning their own homes, with 70% of the homes we sell, on the open market, being sold
to first time buyers.

With a presence in all of the top 10 markets outside London, we are a trusted partner to Homes England, local authorities and registered
providers, with many of these relationships enduring for over 20 years.

These trusted and lasting partnerships underpin our multi-tenure strategy and our position as a top 10 UK home builder, ranked 8[th] in
terms of the number of homes we deliver across the country each year. Our work with registered providers and the build-to-rent market
(or private rented sector) is increasingly important to us, as our partners want to see more multi-tenure developments. Furthermore, as
the UK’s leading brownfield homebuilder with 80% of current developments on brownfield sites, our work goes beyond the delivery of
new homes. By regenerating urban and brownfield land, we give life to thriving new communities and we are delighted to see increased
support for bringing forward brownfield land from the public sector.

It is this special business model which helps drive our operational and financial performance. It enables Keepmoat to successfully deliver
the right products, at the right price, in the right places, while boosting revenues and improving our return on capital, which is one of the
highest among our peers.

I am particularly excited at the prospect of working with Chief Executive Tim Beale again, having previously worked together for around
20 years. The changes he has successfully implemented since his appointment as CEO have seen Keepmoat strengthen its position as
a leading UK homebuilder with a balanced business model, putting customers at the heart of the journey, while implementing and
maintaining the highest standards of build quality and operational efficiency. It is these factors which will underpin our exciting growth
strategy which we will continue to execute over the coming years.

While it is early in my tenure as Chairman, I would like to thank each and every one of our people for all their hard work every day, our
reliable supply chain and our strategic business partners for their commitment to Keepmoat.

Finally, the Board is confident that our unique business model will continue to drive significant growth in quality homes delivered,
revenues and profits in the current financial year and beyond.

Stephen Stone
**Non-Executive Chairman**

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Executive’s Strategic Update

I was delighted to take over the role of Chief Executive Officer at Keepmoat Homes in February 2019 and to be given the opportunity to
steer the business through its next phase of growth and development. The last 12 months have been a truly transformational period for
Keepmoat Homes which has seen us focus on establishing a strong management team and creating a high-performance culture where
our people feel valued and empowered to deliver success. This was recognised through our recent Investors In People (IIP) Audit, where
our assessor, who has been involved with Keepmoat Homes for a number of years, paid tribute to the remarkable turnaround in the
business describing it in his report as ‘huge and quite amazing’ in terms of the enormity of change and the level of progress and
commitment in a relatively short period of time. We still have more to do, as these changes have not yet permeated every area of the
business, but I am confident that we are now in a very strong position moving forward.

I believe that we now have the right people in the right roles and I am extremely proud of the management structure we have created
which has enabled us to deliver an outstanding result in the financial year to 31 October 2019. We have increased our revenues by 8.8%
to £649.8m and delivered 4,035 high quality new homes for our customers.

As we move in to FY20 and a period of increased stability following months of political uncertainty, I am pleased to say that the market
for quality new homes is strong and is particularly favourable, following the recent general election, in Keepmoat Homes’ northern
heartland.

This is also supported by the continued availability of mortgage products that help people get on to the property ladder by making it more
affordable to buy than rent. This is key to our core First Time Buyer market. In the last financial year 70% of our Open Market Sales
were to First Time Buyers and they will continue to be a focus for the business moving forward.

Delivering high quality new homes and delighting our customers is our top priority, so I am pleased to say that in the 12-month reporting
period, Keepmoat Homes increased its customer satisfaction score to 87.4% which is sufficient to achieve a 4-star builder status across
the business and I am confident that this will increase to 5-star in early 2020.

Our current score of 87.7% in the 2019 Home Builders Federation (HBF) annual customer satisfaction survey is a 12% improvement on
our 2018 result and a 15% improvement on our 2017 result.

**A regional focus on national delivery**

Keepmoat Homes is committed to delivering high-quality, affordable homes across the UK, with 11 regional businesses organised into
three divisions: Scotland and North West; North East and Yorkshire; and Midlands and South. The regional businesses and their
boundaries will remain flexible allowing for growth and expansion into new areas where this makes sense and is required to enable all
offices to remain at an optimum size for effective management.

A Divisional Chairman is responsible for each of the three divisions, supported by a Divisional Finance Director. Each of the regional
businesses has its own management board and is empowered to deliver our overarching business excellence strategy, applying the
Group’s policies and systems to local markets and circumstances. This structure and approach means that we are well positioned for
future growth in the right locations.

Over the past twelve months we have concentrated on operational excellence, introducing greater rigour to manage our sites holistically
to fully optimise our development economics over the full life of the site. With enhanced financial processes and reporting, this enables
us to ensure we are buying land with the right margins and in the right locations. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver shareholder
value and delight our customers by building more of the high-quality homes they deserve, in the places they want to live.

**The Strength of our Partnership Business Model**

Our partnership business model is what sets us apart from our competitors. It gives us the ability to secure land on a capital light basis
by negotiating deferred or staged payments, delivering an excellent return on capital and creating a lower risk business model.

We establish and maintain deep enduring relationships with both private and public-sector land owners many of which have lasted for
over 20 years.

We are the largest delivery partner of Homes England and are delivering over 13,000 homes in partnership with them as a member of
consecutive Delivery Partner Panels since 2009, accessing over £177m in funding initiatives. We have used the Home Building Fund to
accelerate the delivery of 2,200 homes and Help to Buy to support the ambitions of 70% of our homebuyers.

We have built our reputation by aligning our approach with our partners’ objectives to deliver successful, large scale, mixed-tenure,
developments. We have a proven track record of revitalising communities through the delivery of high quality homes, in well-designed
and well-connected neighbourhoods and at prices that our customers can afford. Over the last 25 years we have successfully delivered
new homes in some of the country’s most challenging housing markets, demonstrating our commitment to delivery even in the most
demanding market conditions.

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Executive’s Strategic Update

Our partnership approach delivers many advantages including:

- An ability to deliver large scale multi-phased development sites, providing a strong forward pipeline of land

- The opportunity to work with partners who are motivated not only by financial returns, but also by non-financial outcomes (including

   - accelerated delivery, social value and design quality);

- The potential to access grant funding or investment support from Homes England and Local Authority partners; and

- The opportunity to secure repeat business from existing partners and landowners, or to generate new business opportunities on
the strength of our track record and reputation for delivery.

**Community and Stakeholder Engagement**

Our extensive experience and commitment to stakeholder engagement underpins our partnership approach and demonstrates a strong
commitment to working with communities and involving local people at all stages of neighbourhood projects. We recognise the
importance of exploring local needs and making sure all voices are heard to deliver real improvements to our developments. We actively
support our partners in the development and implementation of stakeholder engagement strategies, working proactively to ensure that
lines of communication are developed and maintained and that we develop the right approach.

**Placing our Customers at the Heart of Our Business**

Customer satisfaction is at the heart of everything we do. Ensuring our customers are supported throughout their journey with us, meeting
their expectations and providing them with a high quality new home is extremely important to us.

We regularly review our processes and continually strive to introduce further improvements and deliver greater levels of customer service
and satisfaction. We include all regional management teams in this process to ensure all improvements are delivered consistently across
our entire business.

We have introduced a bespoke quality inspection process “Hallmark”, and best practice guidance and we ensure that our teams receive
regular training on our systems and understand the importance we place on delighting our customers.

We maintain close contact with our customers throughout their journey with us, from their initial enquiry, during the exciting process of
purchasing one of our properties and after moving into their new home to ensure they consistently receive a high level of service.

We also participate in the National House Building Council (NHBC) customer satisfaction survey, we monitor every survey and reflect
on the comments and use this feedback to learn and improve. It also gives us a means to identify and reward our people who demonstrate
excellence in delivering customer care. In 2020 we will introduce an annual Customer Experience Awards Scheme to recognise the very
best teams at Keepmoat Homes, who are raising the bar and leading the way to achieve ever higher standards.

As a business we are committed to providing our customers with fantastic levels of service, from providing comprehensive information
and guidance on their new home to dealing with issues and queries quickly and efficiently.

What matters to our customers:

- A home delivered on time, to the right quality, that is great value for money;

- Great service both during and after the purchase;

- An environment that has been created to provide great amenities and green space;

- A community that they can enjoy and thrive in; and

- Knowing that the development has contributed to the wider community and considered and supported a positive environmental
impact.

**Government commitment to housing supply**

We welcome the ongoing cross-party consensus on the importance of housebuilding and the particular focus and support from all the
main political parties on building more affordable homes during the 2019 General Election. In addition, the Government continues to
support new home building with the extension of Help to Buy until 2023, albeit with reforms restricting the scheme to support First Time
Buyers from 2021 onwards. We welcome these reforms which will ensure that funding is available to the people who need it most. We
believe Help to Buy is a successful scheme that has supported new development whilst helping more people to buy a new home.

The operating environment has been uncertain for three years due to the UK’s decision to leave the European Union (EU), with shortterm disruption to existing trade and regulatory arrangements, uncertainty around the long-term relationship with the EU and the potential
political fall-out from a no-deal Brexit. Whilst we recognise the heightened risk profile associated with the Brexit process, Keepmoat
Homes is in a strong position offering affordably priced homes, with a good range and choice of affordable house types available across
our key markets.

Post General Election, the UK now has a degree of political stability but still has a degree of uncertainty regarding a trade agreement
with the EU. Despite this uncertainty, the prevailing economic and political backdrop for the industry is positive. Home ownership is still

 Chief Executive’s Strategic Update

the tenure of choice for the majority of people, and this combined with the long-term undersupply of new housing means that underlying
demand remains strong.

We look forward to the content of the Government’s Planning White Paper in the year ahead, which will be designed to make the planning
process clearer, more accessible and more certain. Further measures are expected in the March Budget, including devolving strategic
planning powers to combined authorities across England, the First Homes initiative and liberalisation of planning regulations in regard
to upwards extensions to properties.

We also support the Government’s initiatives to assist the increase in output from the industry towards its goal of reaching 300,000 new
homes built each year, across multiple tenures, by the mid-2020’s. We remain committed to contributing to this increase in new home
delivery and Keepmoat Homes is well positioned to deliver new developments, with an emphasis on first time buyers and first-time
movers.

The fundamentals of the housing market are sound, with lenders keen to lend at low fixed rates, average wages rising and employment
at a record high. The increase in buyer demand since the General Election would indicate that buyers and sellers feel the election result
has finally provided a window of stability. The alignment of Keepmoat Homes with the ambitions of Government and our public-sector
partners means we are optimistic about our future at the heart of the UK housing market.

**Positive Market Positioning**

The fundamental underpinnings for the UK Housing Market are strong, including Government support, health of mortgage lenders,
constrained supply, general aspiration to own a home, a high level of employment and relatively low interest rates. However, since the
result of the referendum vote to leave the European Union (EU) in June 2016, there has been a significant amount of uncertainty for
business and consumers which has manifested itself differently in different sectors of the housing market.

Fortunately, Keepmoat, with an average sales price of £161,000 and limited exposure to London and the South East has remained
virtually unaffected in the year to 31 October 2019 with sales across all regions remaining healthy and in line with our expectations.
Since the General Election in December 2019 market and customer sentiment has reflected a greater sense of political stability. Despite
this the terms of the future relationship and trade agreements with the EU remain uncertain. Accordingly, the Board has continued to
consider the potential effect on our business and has updated risk assessments. Key risks have been identified, such as the supply and
cost of materials, the impact on availability of labour and potential changes to Government policy and regulation.

The business has appropriate mitigation plans in place to address any adverse impacts should they arise. Most of our building supplies
are manufactured in the UK and are not at risk from future trade arrangements with the EU. An element of the products procured through
our network of UK based suppliers will be imported from the EU and we are working closely with those suppliers to monitor the potential
impact as trade arrangements with the EU are clarified over the coming year. We believe that the Group’s multi-tenure partnership
approach and expertise in the first-time buyer market provides some resilience should any adverse market effects arise.

We will continue to closely monitor market conditions through the coming year considering wider political and economic developments.

**The UK’s leading brownfield homebuilder**

Keepmoat Homes is the UK’s leading brownfield homebuilder, meaning we do more than just deliver new homes. We regenerate urban
and brownfield land to create thriving new communities. 80% of our current developments are on brownfield sites.

We are pleased to see continued support to bringing forward brownfield land from the public sector. Our work with local authorities
across the UK including in Leeds, Sheffield, Rotherham and Glasgow, provides model approaches for others to follow. For example,
through our partnership with Glasgow City Council we will deliver over 800 new homes in the Sighthill area over the next 10 years on
our transformational Northbridge development as part of the council’s commitment to regenerating the north of the city.

**Developing our Product**

Our house type ranges have been developed to improve efficiency in build, quality and safety to ensure we are aligned with regulatory
changes and space standards. This has been informed by customer feedback to reflect lifestyles and deliver affordable high value homes
and brand consistency throughout the business.

The range has been developed to support our partnership model with a high percentage of both two and three bed homes tailored to
meet requirements for a range of tenures.

Whilst we see the standardisation of detailing and components fundamental in supporting improved quality, waste reduction and delivery
targets, we have also introduced flexibility to enable site specific fenestration and expanded the range to enable the principles of good
quality design and place making to be achieved without compromise to profit optimisation.

High levels of standardisation have supported future demand planning, procurement strategies, rebate recovery and contributed to
improved quality and waste management strategies.

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Executive’s Strategic Update

**Commitment to quality**

Keepmoat actively contributes to the NHBC Standards Review Group and other industry working groups to help ensure our design,
detailing and specification represent best practice and are aligned to future change.

With quality being the key focus of the business, all supporting design detailing, workmanship and material specifications have been
developed to embody good practice and simplification; written in plain English and supported with illustrations and photographs. These
documents, created in collaboration with all departments including subcontractor forums, are used at all stages of design, procurement
and subcontractor appointment. They have informed the Keepmoat quality training programmes, site inductions and are also used as
build quality checks. Documents are also aligned to regulatory requirements with the additional decision taken to remove all combustible
materials from external walls and balconies regardless of dwelling height.

As we move towards meeting the UK target to be Net Zero Carbon by 2050 we are committed to maximising the performance of our
homes not only to meet the challenges of increased building regulations, but also to address the issues of fuel poverty and the desire of
our Local Authority partners to be Net Zero Carbon by 2038.

We are actively working with our supply chain to develop a scalable, affordable and deliverable gas free home solutions that are
comfortable, desirable and have reduced maintenance requirements. A key focus is being placed on improved thermal performance,
reducing energy waste and promoting the integration of renewable energy solutions.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge our people, they are the most important part of our business and without them we couldn’t have
achieved what we have over the last 12 months.

I would like to thank everyone who has worked for and with Keepmoat Homes for their contribution to our success and for all of their
hard work. We could not deliver the homes the UK needs without them.

### Strategic Report – Our Vision, Mission and Values

Our vision, mission and values shape our strategy and the way we work, and mean we are a different type of housebuilder. Our corporate
strengths include our local knowledge, long term partner relationships, national and local presence, supply chain and our ability to
enhance local economies by employing local firms and creating local jobs.

**Keepmoat Vision:**

**Building Communities, Transforming lives.**

This means that we think and act beyond bricks and mortar. As well as creating better places for people to live, we know that our
success depends on us playing our part in building the strong communities our partners and customers want.

We work with our partners to regenerate places to improve economic and social outcomes for the local community while providing
housing choice in these areas. We focus on improving the communities we work in and the people we serve, creating significant local
economic benefits through our supply chain and local employment. 8% of our workforce are trainees, apprentices and graduates.

**Keepmoat Mission:**

**We are committed to developing enduring relationships to build more, vibrant new communities at prices our customers can**
**afford.**

Our Mission explains how we are very different from a traditional housebuilder. It’s in what we do, and how we do it. We create long
term partnerships with large organisations who have unused land or properties. Together we build attractive, affordable and high- quality
homes and communities where people want to live, work and play.

We bring together all facets of housing development, including design, planning and community engagement skills, to help partners
achieve their ambitions. We nurture an extensive supply chain of small and medium sized companies that support us around the country
and make that supply chain available to our public and private sector partners.

**Keepmoat Values:**

**Straightforward, Passionate, Collaborative and Creative.**

Our Values support the vision, shape the culture and reflect how we work and behave.

   - Straightforward: We get the job done in the most efficient way. We are friendly, open and honest. In other words, the people

you could trust on any project, large or small.

   - Passionate: We care about what we do. We put pride and energy into delivering results. We give the best, so more people can

enjoy living in safe, happy communities and homes.

   - Collaborative: We work together in partnership to deliver the very best customer experience. By sharing our expertise, we can

build the very best quality new homes.

   - Creative: We are proactive, flexible and resourceful. We listen, learn and deliver solutions.

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

Keepmoat’s existing strengths support our growth ambitions:

**National scale, local understanding. Keepmoat has successfully grown into a large national business with deep local roots and we**
intend to maintain that national and local approach.

**Develop our comprehensive offer. We have a broad set of skills ranging from developing partnerships establishing supply chains,**
building new homes of all tenures and supporting large-scale, housing-led community regeneration schemes.

**Organic growth. In the next five years we intend to increase the number of new homes we build for sale or rent and continue to make**
a significant contribution to meeting the country’s housing needs.

**Market and sector expansion. The need for more housing means we can bring our distinct approach to new markets:**

   - **Grow our core: Our core markets will remain first time buyer homes, and we will continue to work in partnership with local**
authorities and housing associations. We will continue to build our presence in this market.

   - **Enter new geographies: We continue to expand our offer into Scotland, the South West and South of England, where we have**
historically had little presence.

   - **Enter new sectors: We will enter new markets, so more housing opportunities will be created. We are expanding our home**
offer by introducing offsite manufacturing in to our developments and are creating partnerships with financial organisations
combined with our skills and capabilities to create new homes in the private rental sector.

**Leveraging our scale. We have grown mostly by financing and delivering medium sized housing programmes, whether homes for sale**
or new build for rent. Now, our national scale and financial strength together with the breadth of our experience and depth of our skills
and capabilities, means we are delivering a greater number of larger programmes and partnerships as the core part of our business.

**Shape more partnerships. At the heart of our growth will be deeper and broader partnerships with existing and new partners. That**
requires us to understand partners’ challenges and objectives and develop ways to help them meet their goals whether economic growth; social - tackling deprivation, improving health; environmental - reducing carbon consumption; financial - reducing operating
costs; operational - improving customer service; or strategic - developing their housing portfolios.

**Efficiency and effectiveness. As we grow bigger, we risk becoming less agile. Through our model of regional autonomy, we want the**
best of both worlds - being local and agile, almost like a small business can be. But we also want the benefits of being a large business
such as professional rigour, quality, efficiency and effectiveness in winning and delivering work. That means we share what works well
and avoid duplication and unnecessary costs, as our customers expect.

**Building our brand. To build more homes we will need more people to choose to work for us as colleagues or with us as suppliers and**
partners. That means we need to be better understood. Our audiences need to know what we do, how we do it and why we are both
different, and better, than the competition. We are continuing to build our profile with our partners and across the industry, improving
brand position with customers as we move to 4-star and ultimately to 5-star builder status.

**Our Essentials**

Our Essentials are the five basic building blocks of our business.

   - Safety: The safety of people, partners and communities is at the heart of everything we do.

   - Quality: We work to exceed our stakeholders’ expectations of our service, product and delivery.

   - Customer: We focus on delighting our customer.

   - People: Our people are the heart of our business, providing a service we are proud of.

   - Sustainability: We protect the environment, act ethically and leave a positive legacy.

**Customers and Quality**

**Sales specification**

In response to customer feedback trials of super-fast 1GB broadband have been successfully completed during the year. The provision
of superfast broadband with day one connectivity for our customers will now become a standard specification for all future developments.

Smart homes controls are also in trial and positive feedback has led to the development of this technology as part of our sustainable
design solutions.

**West Gorton – Sustainability Trial Manchester**

Manchester City Council and Keepmoat are jointly delivering a pilot scheme to demonstrate innovative and affordable home
energy solutions which combine fabric improvements, smart control technologies, and energy generation with energy storage
to significantly reduce carbon emissions, energy consumption and lower fuel bills. The pilot will deliver valuable learning to
support future delivery of sustainable housing solutions, social value and affordable housing outcomes for the City and promote
a collaborative journey towards a zero-carbon future.

**The proposed pilot aims to deliver the following benefits:**

   - Smart energy management;

   - Reduction in home energy consumption by 20%;

   - Reduction in electricity bills by up to 90%;

   - Delivery of outstanding thermal performance; and

   - Greater use of renewable, clean, green energy.

**Digitisation in build**

Keepmoat is committed to the continued development of collaborative digital design and management processes.

Our house type ranges have been developed exclusively using 3D BIM software. Following a year of transition and training the digital
portfolio is now informing all new estate layout designs supported by the development and implementation of a new document
management system, which will promote efficiency, transparency and collaboration between Architects, Engineers and supply chain.
The accurate integration of 3rd party designs into the house type models and the clear visualisation of detailing has been developed to
support improved quality in build, reduce waste and improve efficiencies in both design and construction.

The digital models are also informing the development of 3D estate layout designs, which are being used to establish design and build
pre-development risk management decisions to support the digital marketing team with the development of interactive marketing tools.

**Introducing Digital Technology to our Customer Experience**

Our customers are early adopters of new technologies and many of their day to day experiences are conducted online, from shopping
to consuming media. In 2019 we re-engineered our customer journey, using digital technologies to make the process of buying a home
even easier, and more closely aligned to our customers’ expectations. Our customers can now reserve online from the comfort of their
own home and receive a series of automated e-mail communications with helpful information at each key stage of their journey with us.

The transformation of the customer journey has been driven by investment in a new website and other associated technology. This
provides an improved showcase for our products and offers visitors a first-class user experience resulting in higher enquiry volumes
(15% increase year on year). The new platform also offers greater scalability, enabling us to add new features and functionality cost
effectively and in an agile manner.

We have launched ‘My Keepmoat’, an account which allows our customers to manage and personalise their buying journey with
Keepmoat Homes. Over 3,000 potential buyers have created accounts since going live in September 2019.

We have also started to introduce digital technology to our sales offices through the addition of interactive touchscreen technologies,
providing our sales advisors with tools which enable our customers to visualise their future home and street, even before the first homes
are built. This is particularly beneficial for Keepmoat Homes as 84% of our homes are sold off plan and visual cues are a key influencer
of buyer behaviour.

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

Finally, a new web-based platform has been developed to enable customers to personalise their Kitchen and Bathrooms, selecting
options and extras for their new home. Customers can do this at home or on a tablet in the sales office. As well as improving revenue
from options and extras, we anticipate that the new functionality will increase customer satisfaction, by allowing customers to visualise
different colour and product combinations ahead of them being installed.

**Outstanding Build Quality**

The build quality of their new home is of paramount importance to our customers. We are confident that the quality control systems and
warranties we provide allow them to feel confident that their home will be built to an excellent standard. We aspire to go beyond their
expectations.

An efficient construction process is vital to our business and to this end we are introducing several new initiatives to bring about
improvements. We have reviewed our key build stage inspection procedure and now have a formal inspection and sign off process that
allows us to benchmark our build quality. Alongside this we have produced a series of best practice guides to act as an aide memoir for
our site teams to ensure that when inspected our homes meet the required standard and comply with our detailed trade specification.
This inspection procedure is in addition to the formal inspections carried out by building control and the warranty provider.

We recognise that having the right people and teams on site and supporting them in their roles is key to a successful business and to
this end have introduced a site management development programme. This programme will take all new site-based staff members
through a series of training workshops to give them the detailed knowledge around programming, quality and cost control that they need
to develop a successful site. This programme is delivered by senior managers within the business and alongside these workshops the
programme also includes formal training on building regulations and defect prevention which is delivered by external providers to ensure
our teams are kept up to date with the latest regulations. Given the initial success of this programme with our new recruits, our intention
is to now expand the course to include all our existing site-based teams, which will act as a refresher and ensure a consistent approach
across all our developments.

**Modern Methods of Construction (MMC)**

We are a dynamic and progressive business and recognise the role that Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) can play in accelerating
housing delivery, improving build quality and addressing the sustainability challenge.

MMC is also an increasingly important requirement when bidding for public land, with Homes England requiring MMC across all sites
brought forward through their Delivery Partner Panel (DPP3). During 2019 we secured two new Homes England schemes at Brue Farm,
Highbridge and Croston Road, Leyland, both of which included a requirement to construct the homes using MMC.

We have worked in partnership with ilke Homes to create a product tailored to the aspirations of the first-time buyer market and to meet
the requirements of our public sector, registered provider and investor partners.

MMC forms a key strand of our growth plans and fully modular units are expected to make up in the order of 5% of total output over the
2020 financial year.

We are committed to increasing the number of homes we deliver using MMC and by increasing the percentage of off-site manufactured
components into our traditional designs. We continue to develop new ways of working to help address challenges faced in the industry
including reduced availability of skilled workforce, safety in build and a drive for increased speed of delivery, performance and quality.

Currently 12% of completions were delivered in timber frame. We also use off site manufactured roof cassettes, spandrel panels and
are trialling the use of pre-cut intermediate floor assemblies to increase the pre-manufactured value of our homes.

We maintain a close working relationship with ilke Homes for the incorporation of a fully volumetric housing solution. Processes have
been developed following a review of our internal pre-development, sales and construction procedures to ensure the full benefits of the
volumetric system are realised in terms of customer satisfaction, and speed of delivery and quality, with a specific focus on integration
between the home and site infrastructure works.

**Procurement**

**Our Vision is to build a more efficient and strategic Supply Chain.**

**Operational Supply chain**

To support our regional autonomy model, during the financial year we completed the process of decentralisation of the buying function
by moving our buyers away from our Doncaster Head Office and locating them in the regional businesses. All extra resources were
recruited and embedded into the regions reporting in to the regional commercial heads with the support of the Supply Chain Director
with the regions taking full responsibility for the operational procurement process.

The regional buyers work in partnership with framework suppliers to ensure successful operation of the arrangements providing feedback
on performance and service and on future requirements.

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

**Strategic Supply Chain**

Our suppliers play an essential role in our business, providing the materials and services we use to build our homes. It is therefore
essential that we build long-lasting, good relationships that make us their partner of choice.

We operate a series of group-wide, long-term strategic frameworks providing preferential commercial terms and service levels nationally
and regionally for supply of our materials, site equipment and business consumables.

These arrangements offer significant pricing advantages, whilst also including important delivery, service and product warranties which
will help us to maintain and improve our quality and service to our customers.

The Group Supply Chain team manage over 85 arrangements which are made up of framework agreements, commercial arrangements
and formal price lists. In the year to 31 October 2019, 89% of spend was channelled through our frameworks (2018: 87%)

The Framework Agreements align with the Keepmoat Homes Standard Specification and delivers innovative solutions to support our
drive for standardisation. They also provide customer care and product warranty support to our customer services teams. Many of the
agreements provide value engineering support, free site surveys and scheduling and pricing services.

Several of our Framework Agreements are with manufacturers and suppliers who provide their products through our subcontractors and
compliance to these agreements was 96% during the year (2018: 92%).

**Management of Cost**

We work hard to mitigate price increases and ensure that agreements are always competitive and provide the best quality without
compromising on standards. We work in partnership with our suppliers to deliver the best solution for our site teams and our customers.
Many agreements include details of free supplier training for our people and our subcontractors.

**Management of Supply Chain Risk**

We maintain regular contact with suppliers and manufacturers to ensure continuity of supply, negotiating product allocation by volume.
Availability of materials is generally in line with demand and we carefully manage the supply of key products, such as bricks and
plasterboard, by working with the regional businesses and our supply chain partners.

We engage with our suppliers to keep them informed of key forecasting information and also of any changes to our working practices
as appropriate. These long-term frameworks reduce business risk and help ensure a secure supply of our essential materials. We order
around 30 million bricks annually and all are sourced in the UK. In 2019 we reviewed our homecare defects and identified high risk
products. This has allowed us to proactively reduce and mitigate any future defects, promoting an environment for both internal and
external stakeholders where product innovation is welcomed including the specification and inclusion of ARC fire barriers to improve fire
protection and ease of installation and the reduction of waste from previous methods of construction.

**Sustainability in the Supply Chain**

We promote sustainability within the supply chain through our sustainable procurement policy. Working closely with our sustainability
team ensuring all suppliers provide data in a timely manner and to a format that identifies the key metrics. We work with our supply chain
partners to support the development of reporting tools. Whilst every effort is made to support our supply chain, where business critical
data is not provided, an alternative partner is identified to ensure we meet our key obligations.

We work with supply chain partners to ensure compliance with our policies i.e. anti-bribery & corruption, modern slavery, equal
opportunities, health and safety and environmental policies as well as inclusion of our supplier chain partners own polices where
available.

**Focusing on our People and Our Culture**

As a people-centric business, a key focus is delivering our people strategy. This means ensuring that we are the employer of choice in
the home building industry, attracting the right talent, develop our existing talent and engaging all our employees so that they enjoy
working for Keepmoat Homes and feel motivated, supported, trusted, committed and can grow their career with us.

**Culture**

We put our people at the heart of everything we do. Our culture is aligned to our values – it is straightforward, passionate, creative and
highly collaborative; it is also based on openness, challenge, questioning, innovation and high engagement. Our environment is fast
paced, friendly and one where people are supported with their development and encouraged to grow.

Understanding the link between our vision, values and our behaviours, culture and the way we work is extremely important and is
covered at our corporate induction events for our new joiners. This focus on our culture has driven great improvements in our processes,
our customer focus and the quality of our product all of which has driven an increase in our levels of customer satisfaction.

**Talent and Development**

12


-----

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

The emphasis on development and our approach to talent mapping and succession planning is carried out in conjunction with our PDR
process to understand the alignment with our employees’ career aspirations and development objectives. This enables our managers
to focus on understanding and supporting their teams and on helping them to realise their potential and gives us a clear talent pipeline
enabling us to achieve the right balance between our external recruitment and internal promotions.

We have developed a Future Leaders Programme which was launched in the financial year. This year-long programme is aimed at our
high performers that have the potential to reach a senior leadership role and focuses on leadership style and skills, coaching and
mentoring. We also support our Senior Leaders with their development through a series of Leadership Masterclasses as well as
coaching, psychometrics and feedback.

**Apprentices and Trainees**

We are proud to be a member of the 5% Club which means we are committed to at least 5% of our employees being apprentices or
trainees in ‘earn and learn’ positions across all functions within the business or through our subcontractors and partners. This approach
supports our skilled teams, addresses skills shortages and opens up this very important sector as a great career opportunity to them.
We work in partnership with Collab Group to source our apprentices and they have also supported us with the development of our Sales
Development Programme which leads to a formal qualification.

**Diversity and Equality**

We are also keen to encourage diversity. The house building industry is not known for being the most diverse or gender equal and there
is often a lack of candidates for certain roles from diverse backgrounds. We now have two female Regional Managing Directors and our
approach to identifying and developing our talent will continue our focus in this important area.

There is still more to do however and as a company we take the role of promoting the industry to potential candidates who might not
have considered a career in our sector very seriously. We work closely with education providers and community groups to profile the
variety of roles available and are now working in partnership with YesSheCan to promote the industry to women. We also focus on family
friendly changes such as meeting start times to support our employees with children.

Average number of employees, split by gender, for the year ended 31[st] October 2019:

**Male** **Female** **Total**

**Number** **%** **Number** **%** **Number** **%**

**Disability statement**

The Group is committed to achieving a balanced and diverse workforce and pursues an equal opportunities policy through all areas
including recruitment and selection, training and development, performance reviews, succession planning, promotion and ultimately,
retirement. It is our policy to ensure employee related decisions are made on the basis of merit and capability regardless of religion,
race, nationality, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age or disability. If members of staff become disabled, the
Group is committed to continue employment wherever possible and undertakes the necessary adjustments to facilitate ongoing
employment.

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

**Modern Slavery Act 2015**

In November 2019 the Group published its policy statement in accordance with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Our
policy sets out the processes and practices that we have implemented, to ensure that modern slavery has no place to survive within our
business, or within our supply chain. We monitor the effectiveness and review the implementation of this policy, regularly considering its
suitability, adequacy and effectiveness.

**Wellbeing**

We take the health and wellbeing of our employees seriously resulting in the launch of our Mental Health awareness campaign supported
by trained Mental Health first aiders and a real focus on Time to Talk to encourage our people to talk about this important topic without
feeling worried about opening up and sharing. We are developing this further into a KeepWell programme, which is being sponsored by
our CEO and will focus on various health and wellbeing areas. This scheme successfully launched in January 2020.

**Regional Autonomy**
As a business with 11 regions supported by Group Divisional and Central Services it is important that we all work together to support
our Vision and that this is underpinned by our Values and Behaviours. Ensuring we are all aligned with our Group wide governance
framework is also vital. Our Regional Autonomy model provides the framework for how this culture of responsibility and accountability
works in practice and our Leadership teams ensure it is communicated to all employees. Our vision, values and culture are at the core
of our business and form the basis of our corporate induction so new colleagues can be effective from day one.

**Investors in People (IIP)**

Our people-centric culture was recognised in our Investors in People (IIP) accreditation, with the assessor highlighting our effective
people centric culture and the positive impact that this has on our performance as a business.

“Organisations that meet the world-recognised Investors in People Standard reflect the very best in people management excellence.
_Underpinning the Standard is the Investors in People Framework. Based on 25 years of best practice, latest research and workplace_
_trends, the Investors in People Framework is organised around nine key indicators of high performance each with three underpinning_
_themes. To achieve accreditation, organisations are assessed against these themes and indicators carried out using desktop review,_
_interviews, meetings and observations._

_Keepmoat Homes provided various aspects of documentation to support the assessment and interviews and observations took place_
_with across three regions and head office involving meetings both individually, in small groups or by telephone with 48 (4.5%) of the_
_Keepmoat staff._

_The transformation which has taken place over the last 12 months is huge and quite amazing. Having been involved with Keepmoat for_
_many years now, I had anticipated the organisation to implement some changes and to have done enough to meet the requirements of_
_the Standard. I did not however expect or anticipate the level of commitment, the enormity of the changes or the level of progress that_
_has been made in a relatively short period of time._

_The bold changes that have been initiated to regain and re-establish an effective people centric culture are a credit to the leadership_
_team and have already seen significant improvement in the organisation’s performance. What is more the extent of the changes have_
_as yet not permeated to every area of the organisation and therefore the impact and benefit to the business have yet to be fully realised.”_

**Keeping People Safe Every Day**

We continued to significantly improve our performance and approach to managing Health and Safety (H&S) in the last financial year,
having restructured our operating and support models resulting in much improved risk management and outcomes. Our Group H&S
department was restructured to give enhanced support to each division in the form of Divisional H&S, Environmental & Sustainability
Business Partners who are experienced and professionally qualified in HSS and support the business in relation to policy, governance
and guidance.

Our focus on risk has been throughout all phases of a development with particular emphasis on site risks. We changed our system for
assessing and controlling risk, giving responsibility to site managers who have the best understanding of our developments. This has
resulted in greater ownership and improved management of H&S risks on site. We have also developed robust, clear performance
standards for higher risk activities such as timber frame construction, working around underground services, falls from height and plant
and pedestrian interface.

We have invested in new IT H&S systems and platforms to enable us to be more efficient and effective. One such initiative saw us
moving away from the traditional way of undertaking health and safety inductions, delivered on site by site managers, to these being
carried out off site and on line. This has resulted in a significantly improved understanding by operatives of the precautions to be taken
on site and has improved our resilience and compliance in this area.

Our H&S support model has changed, to the extent that we moved away from employing internal safety advisors to regularly inspect
sites to an outsourced model engaging NHBC to undertake site inspections monthly. This has provided independent and improved
monitoring of site standards.

**Leadership and Governance**

As part of our continuous improvement philosophy, we have constituted an ‘Executive H&S Committee’ that comprises the CEO,
Executive Members and the Group HSS Director.

The Committee meets bi-monthly and has clear terms of reference centered around reviewing performance, determining policy and
improvement initiatives. Our Due Diligence comprises; - periodic third-party ISO certification audits; annual internal audit of H&S
arrangements; monthly NHBC H&S site inspections and independent pre-qualification of sub-contractors through CHAS.

**Raising the Bar for Health & Safety Performance**

Our performance throughout the year has seen continuous sustainable improvement in all of our H&S KPI’s. Our primary KPI detailing
the Annual Injury Incidence Rate (AIIR) has improved by 51% and is at 7.5% of the peer group average based on the latest HBF AIIR
for the 12 months ended 31 March 2019.

- Our Lost Time Injury frequency rate has reduced by 48%

- All Accident frequency rate has reduced by 28%

- Utility strike rate has reduced by 52%

- 571 Director’s H&S Visits undertaken

- 3,025 Site Manager Inspections

- 2,643 actions raised

**Enforcement Authority Intervention**

The Health & Safety Executive visited our sites on nine occasions and took no enforcement action and in recognition of our performance
we were awarded the Gold Award by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA).

**Sustainability**

During 2019 we continued our focus on sustainability. Through a detailed stakeholder consultation and materiality process we updated
our Sustainability Policy and Strategy to ensure it aligns with our stakeholder’s priorities, addresses material issues and is aligned to the
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Whilst updating our Sustainability Strategy and priorities we have focussed on three key
environmental focuses:

1. Environmental Management Systems and Controls

2. Energy and Carbon

3. Waste Management and Recycling

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

**1. Environmental Management Systems and Controls**
All Keepmoat Homes operations are included within our ISO 14001 certified management system, ensuring contemporary systems and
effective controls are in place for all environmental risks and opportunities.

As part of the updates to our Sustainability Strategy this year, we have worked to further embed our environmental controls, including:

- Undertaking a full management system review, updating key standards and processes;

- Delivering more than 1,200 hours of environmental training;

- Implementation of monthly environmental performance reports for all regional businesses; and

- Reinforcing the reporting of Environmental Incidents and Environmental Hazards Observed (HazObs), increasing ownership of
environmental issues and enabling greater focused support on key environmental risks and opportunities.

This activity has resulted in a significant increase in operational ownership of environmental issues, demonstrated by the increase in
reporting of Environmental HazObs, facilitating preventative measures before an environmental incident occurs. Moving forwards, we
will seek to further develop and roll-out environmental training on key risks and opportunities and continue to review environmental
standards and align to other business functions.

**2. Energy & Carbon**

Climate change and the reduction of carbon emissions is a key focus for Keepmoat and our stakeholders. During the last 12 months we
have reduced our carbon footprint by 2.5% by introducing monthly reporting on carbon emissions and focusing on reduction of key
sources and reducing site generator diesel consumption and plot utility consumption. Moving forward we will seek to drive further
improvements by setting carbon reduction targets to ensure continued contribution to climate change mitigation; procure renewable
electricity; implement opportunities identified in our 2019 ESOS energy efficiency audits and update our business travel and fleet policies
to encourage the uptake of low emission vehicles, car sharing and the use of public transport.

**3. Waste and Recycling**

Over the last year we have focussed on decoupling business output from the generation of waste. This focus has achieved an absolute
reduction of 11.2% in waste removal from site. This improvement has been achieved through monthly reporting and analysis of waste
cost and performance, increased use of material management plans facilitating the reuse of soils and aggregates and the development
of strategic waste partnerships, optimising waste controls and segregation. Moving forward we will continue to drive further improvements
by further developing our strategic waste management partnerships and looking for ways to embed circular economy opportunities to
design out waste and make greater use of recycled materials.

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

**Social Value**

Keepmoat Homes builds high quality and affordable homes for first time buyers and social landlords. A key theme in our approach is to
work with our public-sector partners to deliver real and meaningful social and economic impact aligned to local community priorities
around our sites. Over 80% of our sites are on public sector land and developed in close partnership with Local Authorities, and 80% of
our sites are brownfield in regeneration areas.

This development approach means that supporting our partners to deliver their social value priorities and build sustainable communities
is at the core of our business and integral to securing future land.

**How we** **measure social value**

During 2019 Keepmoat developed an online tool to support the calculation of social value and SROI from activities in surrounding
communities. This tool is used during:

**Bidding: to compare packages of social value activities, providing clients with options aligned to their key priorities, using SROI to**
quantitatively compare options,

**Delivery: to record and store activity, and track actual impacts, and;**

**Reporting: we report our performance** to regional teams via the Monday Matters,

**Keepmoat Social Value**

Through the last financial year Keepmoat has undertaken a wide range of community activities, it has fund raised over £80,000 for good
causes and have supported and mentored a significant number of young people. Through these activities we have facilitated the delivery
of £27million of evidenced social value.

**Examples of our Social Value Activities and Achievements**

**Kick Start Programme - Hull**

Bransholme in Hull is one of the most deprived wards in the city with high levels of unemployment. Keepmoat working in partnership
with Riverside (a national Registered Provider of Social Housing) has implemented a Pre-employment construction programme.

The programme is delivered over 12 days and includes:

Employability skills, Manual Handling, Working at Heights, On-site Fire warden, Banksman, COSHH, Health & Safety Level 2, CSCS
test and 4 days practical construction work.

Key outcomes:

   - 11 Residents have completed the full Kick Start Programme and now have the skills and qualification to enter in to the
construction industry

   - 6 Apprenticeship opportunities have been created (3 with Keepmoat direct and 3 with supply chain partners) including an
Apprentice Assistant Site Manager

   - 5 Residents have signed up onto construction training courses with Orchard Training

**Social Value - £127,000 of social value generated for the Local Authority and local community**

**NEET Summer Project - Salford**

**A group of Year 11 school leavers gave up their free time over the summer holidays to gain an insight into the construction**
**industry and learn new skills**

Keepmoat Homes worked in partnership with Salford City Council, Inspiring Communities Together, Connexions and Salix Homes to
coordinate and deliver the 7-week training programme.

The school leavers, at risk of becoming NEET, (not in education, employment or training) had all expressed an interest in pursuing a
career in the construction industry and were recruited to join the project to help them choose the right career path, develop their skills
and ensure they progressed on in to further education, training or employment.

**Social Value - £21,000 of social value generated (SROI £5.69 per £1 invested)**

### Strategic Report – Making the most of our strengths

**World of Work Programme – Leicester**

Working in partnership with Leicester City Council and Leicester College, Keepmoat has been supporting Level 1 Construction students
as part of Leicester College’s ‘World of Work (WOW) Experience Programme’.

Completed over one week, the programme provides students with the opportunity to develop key employability skills, learn more about
the construction industry and engage with local construction companies. This provides opportunities for lower level students and those
with additional needs to develop the skills and qualities employers are looking for including; self-confidence, resilience, problem solving
and a sense of community.

Construction is one of the country’s leading economic drivers, however the sector is facing a skills shortage. The WOW Programme
provides a great opportunity for local students to meet with prospective employers and learn more about the variety of career
opportunities available.

**Social Value - £63,000 of social value generated**

### Strategic Report – Chief Financial Officer’s review 

We have continued the trend of controlled growth seen in previous years, delivering significant growth in earnings and record plot
volumes this year. With the right management structure, land pipeline security and improvements in operational effectiveness, the Group
is well placed to deliver on its strategy going forward.

**Performance**

The business delivered revenue of £649.8m for the 12 months to 31 October 2019, 8.8% higher than the equivalent 12 months in the
prior year (12 months to 31 October 2018: £597.0m)[1]. The number of home sales increased over the same period by 1.2% to 4,035 (12
months to 31 October 2018: 3,988), with average selling price increasing by 7.3% to £161,000 (12 months to 31 October 2018:
£150,000).

Contribution margin increased significantly by 24.1% to £119.6m, (12 months to 31 October 2018: £96.4m) reflecting both increased
plot volumes and improved site level profitability, including continued growth in our newer regions. This has been achieved in conjunction
with an increase in our Registered Provider & Private Rented Sector tenure mix to 33.8% (12 months to 31 October 2018: 28.2%) in line
with our partnership model, providing resilience in the long term.

Adjusted EBIT increased 33.7% to £61.1m (12 months to 31 October 2018: £45.7m) largely as a result of the improvement in Contribution
with appropriate investment made in the structure of the business to build a scalable platform for future growth.

Adjusted operating profit for the 12-month period was £58.5m (12 months to 31 October 2018: £41.6m); an increase of 40.6%.

In order to provide clearer visibility of the underlying performance of the Group, the Board elect to measure profits on an adjusted basis
alongside other key KPIs as follows:

### Strategic Report – Chief Financial Officer’s review 

**Cashflow and Financial Position**

At 31 October 2019 the Group had net assets of £103.7m (2018: £73.4m) an increase of 41.3% (£30.3m) compared to the prior year.

Inventories have increased by 5.8% from £385.4m at 31 October 2018 to £407.9m at 31 October 2019, reflecting the continued growth
of the business, including in our newer regions in Scotland, the South and the South West. Land inventory represents approximately
half of the inventory balance.

The Group was cash generative, with £44.7m generated from operations before tax (7 months to October 2018: outflow £22.2m) after
investing £14.6m in working capital in the year and the Group ended the year with net cash (including bank overdrafts) of £35.2m (2018:
£5.9m).

**Refinancing**

On 11 December 2018, the Group put in place a new debt package for the next six years to support the Group’s growth. On that date
the Group drew down a £150.0m term loan facility attracting interest of 6.5% plus Libor due for repayment in December 2024 and on
the same date redeemed its £100.0m senior secured notes at par. The Group did not incur any repayment penalties on redeeming its
senior secured notes.

On 11 December 2018 the Group repaid in full its £37.5m revolving credit facility and on the same day drew down new debt in the form
of a £27.5m revolving credit facility. The new facility is a super senior revolving credit facility with a limit of £27.5m due for renewal in
June 2025 attracting interest at a rate of 3.0% plus Libor. On the same day the Group repaid its overdraft and drew down a new overdraft
as part of the super senior revolving credit facility giving a combined total facility of £55.0m.

The new facilities provide the Group with increased liquidity on lower interest rates. The outcome of the refinancing was that the Group’s
liquidity increased by £22m after refinancing costs.

**Financing costs**

External financing costs in the period were £22.5m (7 months to 31 October 2018: £12.3m) leading to a cash outflow of £12.5m (7
months to 31 October 2018: £11.2m). The charge includes non-cash amounts of £6.8m (7 months to 31 October 2018: £2.6m) in respect
of the unwind of discount on deferred land payments.

**Taxation**

The current period tax charge of £6.9m (7 months to 31 October 2018: £1.0m charge) is made up of a current tax charge of £5.2m and
a deferred tax charge of £1.7m.

**Working capital**

The amount of working capital required to service the Group’s operations is closely monitored and controlled and forms a key part of the
management information reviewed on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Current assets mainly comprise trade receivables, work in
progress and land held for the development of private housing and affordable housing through partnership schemes. As the Group’s
trade receivables relate mainly to public sector and Housing Association clients, there is no significant history of bad or doubtful debts.

**Performance bond facilities**

The Group, like most construction businesses, may in some cases rely on the use of performance bonds issued by surety companies
to our clients. The directors are pleased to report that the Group has adequate performance bonding lines in place with surety companies
to meet the Group’s growth plans.

**Land pipeline**

At 31 October 2019, the number of plots within our land pipeline, including sites where we have been appointed as preferred developer
was 25,024 representing over 6 years of delivery at current volumes, providing significant forward visibility for the Group.

**Impact of the new accounting standards**

IFRS16 “Leases” is effective for the Group from the 2020 financial year commencing on 1 November 2019. The Group has completed
a review of the impact of this standard and does not believe there will be a material impact on profit or net assets, although new offsetting
right of use assets of £7.0m and liabilities of £7.6m will be recognised. Further information on the impact of the change is described in
the principal consolidated accounting policies of the Group financial statements.

### Directors’ Report

The directors present their annual report and the consolidated audited financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 October
2019.

**Principal activities**

Keystone Midco Limited is an investment holding company heading a group of companies, which are engaged in the construction of
residential dwellings and associated development contracts.

The Company’s subsidiaries are listed in note 22 to the financial statements.

**Business review and future developments**

The consolidated profit for the financial year was £30.3m, (7 month period ended 31 October 2018: £8.6m). The Company did not pay
a dividend during the year (7 month period ended 31 October 2018: £nil), no final dividend is proposed (7 month period ended 31 October
2018: £nil). A review of the results, performance and future developments for the Group are presented in the Strategic Report on pages
3 to 23 which forms part of this report.

**Going concern**

The directors have considered the adequacy of the Group’s financial resources through a review of the financial projections for the
business and taking into account the refinancing of the Group’s debt during the year. The Group drew down a £150m term loan and a
new RCF facility on 11 December 2018, for further details see note 15. After careful consideration the directors are satisfied that the
Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the
date of signing the financial statements. For these reasons the directors continue to apply the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.

**Financial risk management**

In the course of its ordinary activities, the Group is exposed to financial risks which include liquidity, credit and interest rate risks. These
risks are monitored and managed through robust policies and procedures. Further details are included in Note 21 of the financial
statements.

Liquidity risk relates to the Group generating sufficient cash flow to meet its operational requirements while avoiding debt covenant
breaches or excessive debt levels. Total borrowings are a combination of long term loans and long term committed revolving working
capital credit facilities.

Credit risk is in relation to trade receivables from customers. Given that the majority of trade receivables are with public and regulated
organisations, the exposure to credit risk is very limited.

Interest rate risk relates to the impact of interest rate increases on the Group’s floating rate borrowings. Following the Group’s refinancing
on 11 December 2018 the Group’s term loan, revolving credit and overdraft facilities are all on floating rates. The Group’s interest rate
risk has increased following completion of refinancing.

**Directors**

The directors who held office during the year and up to the date of signing the financial statements are given below:

M A Budd

E J C Hawkes

S J Robertson

J M D Thomson (resigned 8 April 2019)

M R Priest

T M Beale

M A Budd, E J C Hawkes and S J Robertson are representatives of the Company’s shareholders, being TDR Capital LLP, which has
effective control of 75.7% of the issued share capital of the Company whilst Sun Capital Partners has effective control of the remaining
13.3%.

In accordance with the Articles of Association, none of the directors are required to retire by rotation.

**Employees**

The Group believes that its success depends upon its employees and their development. Further details are provided within the Strategic
Report.

**Directors’ indemnities**

The Group maintains liability insurance for its directors and officers which remains in place up to the date of this Annual Report. The
Group has also provided an indemnity for its directors, which is a qualifying third-party indemnity provision for the purposes of the
Companies Act 2006.

### Directors’ Report

**Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements**

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulation.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared
the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union and company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law). Under company law the directors
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group
and company and of the profit or loss of the group and company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are
required to:

   - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

   - state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the group financial statements and
whether United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the company financial
statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

   - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

   - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and company
will continue in business.

The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the group and company's
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and company and enable them to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

**Directors’ confirmations**

In the case of each director in office at the date the Directors’ Report is approved:

   - so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the group and company’s auditors are unaware;
and

   - they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the group and company’s auditors are aware of that information.

**Walker Guidelines**

The directors consider the annual report and financial statements to comply with all aspects of the guidelines for transparency and
disclosure in private equity owned companies.

**Independent auditors**

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office.

Approved by and signed on behalf of the Board.

     - Keystone Midco Limited’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the “financial
statements”) give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31
October 2019 and of the group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended;

     - the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;

     - the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101
“Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and

     - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Financial Statements (the “Annual
Report”), which comprise: the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 October 2019; the consolidated income
statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the
consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; the principal consolidated accounting
policies and the principal company accounting policies; and the notes to the financial statements.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

_Independence_

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when:

     - the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is
not appropriate; or

     - the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may
cast significant doubt about the group’s and company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis
of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

We have nothing to report in respect of the above matters.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s
and company’s ability to continue as a going concern. For example, the terms of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from
the European Union are not clear, and it is difficult to evaluate all of the potential implications on the group’s trade,
customers, suppliers and the wider economy.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our
auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency
or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement
of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed,
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us
also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

_Strategic Report and Directors’ Report_

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report
and Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 October 2019 is consistent with the financial statements and has been
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements_

As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements, the directors
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.

_Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

_Use of this report_

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands
it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

# Other required reporting

**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

     - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

     - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or

     - certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

     - the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2019

**General information**

Keystone Midco Limited (the Company) is a private limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of the registered
office is Keystone Midco Limited, The Waterfront, Lakeside Boulevard, Doncaster, DN4 5PL. The nature of the Group’s operations and
its principal activities are set out in the directors report.

The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because the Group operates exclusively in the United Kingdom. All financial
information is rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except where otherwise indicated.

**Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except investment property, available for sale financial
assets and retirement benefit assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements have been consistently applied
to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated. The Group previously changed its reporting date from March to October and as a
result the comparative period presents performance for the 7 month period to 31 October 2018.

**Prior year restatement**

During the current financial year, the disclosure of certain contract assets and liabilities have been restated from Trade receivables and
Accruals within Trade and other receivables to Contract assets and Contract Liabilities within Trade and Other payables respectively to
more appropriately reflect the nature of the assets and liabilities. Also during the current financial year, the disclosure of the contingency
fund asset has been restated from Other receivables to Prepayments and the balance has been split between current and non-current
classification to more appropriately reflect the nature of the asset.

The consolidated balance sheet as at 31 October 2018 has therefore been restated accordingly to reflect the same basis of classification
of Trade and other receivables and Trade and other payables balances. There was no change to the reported financial performance,
total assets or total liabilities position or cash flows of the Group for either restatement. Refer to Note 12 and Note 14 for further detail.

**Going concern**

The directors have considered the adequacy of the Group’s financial resources through a review of the financial projections for the
business and taking into account the refinancing of the Group’s debt during the year. The Group drew down a £150m term loan and a
new RCF facility on 11 December 2018, for further details see note 15. After careful consideration the directors are satisfied that the
Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the
date of signing the financial statements. For these reasons the directors continue to apply the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.

**Adoption of new and revised standards**

At the date of approving these financial statements, the following new and revised standards and interpretations were in issue but were
not yet effective (and in some cases had not been adopted by the EU). None of these revised standards and interpretations have been
adopted early by the Group.

- IAS 19 (Amended) – Employee benefits

- IAS 27 (Amended) - Separate financial statements

- IAS 28 (Amended) - Investments in associates and joint ventures

- IFRS 7 (Amended) - Financial instruments: Disclosures

- IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over income tax treatments

- IFRS 3 (Amended) – Definition of a business

With the exception of those mentioned below, the directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in
future periods will have a material effect on the financial position or performance of the Group and Company.

**IFRS 16 – Leases**

The IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases in January 2016. The standard sets out principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosure of leases. The standard is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019, for the Group transition to IFRS 16
will take place on 1 November 2019. The Group will adopt the new standard taking advantage of the modified retrospective approach
and thereby not restate its comparative period.

IFRS 16 removes the long-standing distinction between finance leases and operating leases and introduces a single lessee accounting
model, with some limited exemptions for short-term leases of less than 12 months and leases of low-value assets, based on a ‘right to
use’ principle.

34


-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2019

The Group is in the process of quantifying the implications of the new standard and, utilising discount rates calculated during the year,
the following impacts are shown below if the standard had been used at 31 October 2019:

   - There would be an increase in total assets of £7.0m, as leased assets, currently accounted for off balance sheet (i.e.
classed as operating leases under IAS 17) will be recognised on balance sheet as right to use assets. The biggest asset
category impacted for the Group is expected to be land and buildings.

   - There would be an increase in debt, as liabilities relating to operating leases are recognised on balance sheet. The
impact being an additional liability of £7.6m

   - Operating lease expenditure will be reclassified and split between depreciation and finance costs. Therefore, operating
profit would have seen an increase of £0.6m if the standard was in use.

The composition of the Group’s lease commitments will change over time and the discount rates applied are required to be updated to
reflect the prevailing economic environment.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Keystone Midco Limited, its subsidiary undertakings and the Group’s share of
the results of joint ventures and associates.

(a) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date
that control ceases.

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary
is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred, and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of
the acquiree. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed in administrative costs as incurred. All identifiable assets and liabilities acquired,
and contingent liabilities assumed are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest as compared with the Group’s share of the
identifiable net assets are recognised as goodwill. Where the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the total
consideration transferred, a gain from a bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the income statement after the fair values initially
determined have been reassessed.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised
losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Accounting
policies of acquired subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with accounting policies adopted by the Group.

(b) Joint ventures

Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, interest in joint ventures is initially
recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in
other comprehensive income.

Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds its equity accounted investment in a joint venture, the carrying amount of the equity interest
is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive
obligations. Appropriate adjustment is made to the results of joint ventures where material differences exist between a joint venture’s
accounting policies and those of the Group.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is impaired.
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of the impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate
and its carrying value and recognises the amount in the income statement adjacent to its share of profit/(loss) from associates.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint
ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

(c) Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method, applying the same
policy as set out for joint ventures above.

35


-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2019

**Segmental reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The
chief operating decision maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments has
been identified as Keepmoat Group’s executive directors.

**Revenue and profit recognition**

Revenue is recognised based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This can lead to
differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. Primarily, for those sites in
respect of which stage payments are received from registered providers for the provision of housing or where the Group undertakes
development contracts, revenue is recognised based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. The directors consider the
provision of land and residential properties to represent a single performance obligation which represents a judgement taken in the
application of IFRS 15.

_Sale of housing to open market customers_

Revenue and profits associated with the sale of housing to private open market customers are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income on legal completion.

Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable on legal
completion. Open market sale plots are recognised at the agreed sales price deemed to be fair value.

_Sale of housing to registered provider customers and associated development contracts with stage payments_

The Group constructs and sells residential properties and undertakes associated development activities under long-term contracts with
customers. Such contracts are entered into before construction of residential properties or associated development activities begin.
Under the terms of the contracts, the Group is continually restricted from redirecting the properties or development works to another
customer and has an enforceable right to payment for work done. Revenue from construction of residential properties and associated
development activities is therefore recognised over time based on a certified monthly valuation of work performed or the assessed
physical stage of completion at the balance sheet date. The directors consider that this method is an appropriate measure of the progress
towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations under IFRS 15.

On the balance sheet, the Group reports the net contract position for each contract as either an asset or a liability. A contract represents
an asset where costs incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses) exceed progress billings; a contract represents a liability
where the opposite is the case.

_Sale of housing to registered provider customers without stage payments_

Revenue and profits associated with these activities are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on legal completion as
this is the point at which control is passed from the Group to the purchaser.

_Profit recognition_

Gross profit is recognised for all house sales (to open market customer and to registered providers) and associated development
activities, when the related revenue is recognised in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy, based on the latest forecast
for the gross margin expected to be generated over the life of the development or phase of the development. The expected gross margin
to be generated from each development is calculated as an output of a development valuation completed using latest selling prices and
forecasts of all land and construction costs associated with that development. The application of a whole site margin to determine
development profitability is a judgement taken in the application of IFRS 15.

The estimation methodology used to determine the gross profit margin recognised on each development was refined during the year,
this change in methodology did not have a material effect on the gross profit recognised in the year, of £119.2m.

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2019

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of
the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the
significance of their nature or amount.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of
the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired at the acquisition date. It is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment
at least annually or when there is a triggering event, by considering the net present value of future cash flows. For the purposes of
testing for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the value in use and
the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement.

Where the fair value of the consideration given is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired, the
difference is immediately recognised in the income statement as a gain from a bargain purchase.

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating
units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.

**Intangible assets**
Other intangible assets, such as those identified on acquisition by the Group that have finite lives, are recognised at fair value and
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

Intangible assets are being amortised over the following periods, with amortisation being charged to cost of sales unless otherwise
stated:

- Contracted customer relationships – in line with expected profit generation, over a term of seven years

- Land development rights – in line with expected profit generation, varying from one to twenty years

- Computer software – on a straight-line basis over three years. (Amortisation expense is included in administrative
expenses)

Intangible assets with a finite useful economic useful life are tested for impairment when there is an indication that the intangible asset
may be impaired.

**Property, plant and equipment**

All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.

The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Depreciation is calculated
so as to write off the cost of each asset, less their estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic
lives, or until the date of disposal.

The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:

Leasehold property improvements over the lease term

Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings 10 – 50%

No depreciation is provided on freehold land

**Investment Properties**

Investment properties are initially measured at cost, being purchase price including directly attributable expenditure. Investment
properties are subsequently measured at fair value.

**Operating leases**

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

The Group rents surplus property under short and medium-term arrangements. Income is recognised over the period of lease when the
Group can reliably measure likely flow of economic benefits. These are treated as operating lease arrangements.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method, less loss allowance. The loss allowance is calculated based on historic loss rates from payment profiles of sales in prior periods.
The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the debtor’s
ability to settle the receivable.

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2019

In respect of accounting for trade and other receivables, the Group has applied IFRS 9’s simplified approach to provisioning and has
calculated this using lifetime expected losses.

When a trade receivable is wholly or partially uncollectible, any uncollectible amount is written off against the loss allowance. Subsequent
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the loss allowance. Changes in the carrying amount of the loss
allowance are recognised in the income statement.

**Impairment of financial assets**

IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model requiring the assessment of the expected credit loss on each class of financial asset at
each reporting date. This includes trade receivables, amounts due from related party undertakings, other receivables and contract
assets. This assessment takes into consideration changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset.

**Inventories**

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

(a) Land held for and under development

Land held for and under development includes land purchase costs and costs directly attributable to enhancing land value.

(b) House building developments in progress

House building developments in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct expenditure,
together with an appropriate proportion of production overheads. Net realisable value represents the estimated amount at which
inventory could be realised after allowing for costs of completion and realisation.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand. Bank overdrafts are also included, as
they are an integral part of the Group’s cash management. In the consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within
borrowings in current liabilities.

**Restricted cash**

Financial assets include cash receipts related to certain developments held in development specific bank accounts over which third
parties hold a charge and joint mandate. The cash in these accounts can be used to finance the investment of work in progress in the
specific development to which it relates and become unrestricted on the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent in accordance with
the terms of loans or other contractual arrangements relating to the development.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms,
particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate and subsequently
held at amortised cost. The discount to the nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs
using the effective interest rate. Changes in estimates of the final payment due are taken to inventory (land held for and under
development) and in due course, to cost of sales in the income statement.

**Loans and borrowings**

Interest bearing bank loans, term loans, senior secured notes and other borrowings are recorded initially at their fair value, net of direct
transaction and debt issue costs.

Such instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, including commitment fees, arrangement fees
and any other costs directly related to the borrowings are recognised over the term of the instrument using the effective rate of interest.

Any instrument repaid before the end of the contractual term will result in any unamortised costs being immediately recognised in the
income statement.

**Equity instruments**

Equity instruments such as ordinary share capital issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of directly
attributable incremental issue costs. Proceeds are allocated between nominal value and share premium.

**Income tax**

Income tax expense represents the current and deferred tax charges.

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.

### Principal consolidated accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2019

Current tax is the Group’s expected tax liability on taxable profits for the year using tax rates substantively enacted at the reporting date
and any adjustment to tax in respect of previous years. Where current tax losses are available but not utilised in the period, a deferred
tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is considered recoverable.

Taxable profit differs from that reported in the income statement because it is adjusted for items of income or expense that are assessable
or deductible in other years or are never assessable or deductible.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax rates used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance
sheet liability method.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised in full if future taxable
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if
the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination)
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are only offset to the extent that that there is a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax assets and liabilities.

**Government grants**

Government grants are recognised at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions
attaching to them and the grants will be received. Grants related to purchase of assets are recognised against assets and unwound
over the useful lives of the related assets.

**Retirement benefit obligations**

(a) Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as they accrue. Differences between contributions
payable in the year and contributions actually paid are included within either accruals or prepayments on the balance sheet. The position
at the end of the current and prior period was a prepayment.

(b) Contractual benefit obligations

The Group operates the Keepmoat Limited Group Pension Plan (“KPP”), a defined contribution plan, with assets held in independently
administered funds. Some members of the KPP have a contractual promise from the Group, which is separate to the benefits payable
by the KPP, being an arrangement between Keepmoat Limited and the applicable employees. The obligation arising under this
arrangement has been calculated by a qualified independent actuary and accounted for as a long-term employee benefit. The contractual
liabilities are measured using the projected unit actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality
corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.

Actuarial gains and losses of the contractual liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Gains
and losses arising on curtailment and settlements are taken to the income statement as incurred.

**Provisions**

Provisions for remedial contract obligations, vacant property obligations and restructuring costs are recognised when: the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation; and the amount has can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the
provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group’s management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised.

The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within
the next financial year are addressed below.

- **Estimation of development profitability**

The gross profit from revenue generated on each of the Group’s developments in a specific period is based on the latest forecast for the
whole site gross profit expected to be generated over the life of that development or phase. The expected gross profit is calculated as
an output of development valuations completed using latest selling prices and forecasts of all land and construction costs associated
with the development. These calculations of expected gross profits require a degree of estimation due to their long-term nature and are
sensitive to future movements in both the estimated cost to complete and expected selling prices.

Group’s management has established internal controls to regularly review and ensure the appropriateness of the forecasts and estimates
made on an individual development basis. However, a change in estimated gross profits over a number of developments (due, for
example, to changes in estimates of costs remaining or a reduction in average selling prices in the private market) could materially affect
profitability. As an illustration, a reasonably possible change in profits of 1% across all developments in the year to 31 October 2019
would have reduced gross profit and net assets by an estimated £6.5m.

Over time **116,014** 58,363

**Total** **649,808** 324,240

All revenue is generated in the United Kingdom. There are no single customers that account for 10% or more of the Group’s revenue.

At 31 October 2019, the aggregate amount of revenue allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations was £235.5m (31 October 2018:
£127.9m). Approximately half of these amounts will be recognised within one year with the remainder recognised over varying contractual
lengths.

Contract assets and liabilities are included within “trade and other receivables” and “trade and other payables” respectively on the face
of the balance sheet. Where there is a corresponding contract asset and liability in relation to the same contract, the balance shown is
the net position. The timing of work performed (and thus revenue recognised), billing profiles and cash collection, results in trade
receivables (amounts billed to date and unpaid), contract assets (unbilled amounts where revenue has been recognised) and customer
advances and deposits (contract liabilities), where no corresponding work has yet to be performed, being recognised on the Group’s
balance sheet.

**Impairment review of goodwill**

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications the goodwill might be impaired. In testing
goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the recoverable amount of the Group has been determined from value in use
calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the forecast revenue and profit, discount rates
and long-term growth rates by market sector. Future forecast revenue is based on management’s knowledge of actual results from prior
years and latest forecasts for the current year, along with secured works, management’s expectation of the future level of work available
within the market sector and expected changes in selling volumes and prices for completed houses. In establishing future profit margins,
the margins currently being achieved are considered in conjunction with expected inflation rates in each cost category and the current
market value of land being acquired.

Cash flows beyond the five-year plan period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% (31 October 2018: 2%) per annum.
The growth rate used is an estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the market sectors where the Group operates. A pre-tax
discount rate of 10.7% (31 October 2018: 10.3%) has been applied, being the estimated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for
current market conditions.

In view of the uncertainty surrounding the UK’s decision to leave the European Union the Group has undertaken a detailed exercise
around assumptions used in the cash flows noted above and a sensitivity analysis on those cashflows. The sensitivity analysis to
changes in cashflow indicated headroom which was materially above the carrying value, so the directors are of the opinion that no
impairment of goodwill is required.

House building developments in progress **207,939** 213,645

**407,887** 385,397

The Group carries out a detailed annual review of the net realisable value of land held for and under development both relating to plots
currently in development, and land and phases of sites not yet in development.

Net realisable value for land where construction of homes had commenced at the year-end or is anticipated to commence within the
next 12 months was assessed by estimating selling prices and costs (including sales and marketing expenses) taking into account
current market conditions.

Land where house building had not commenced at the year end and was more likely to be sold undeveloped is assessed by re-appraising
the land using current selling prices and costs for the proposed development and assuming an appropriate financial return to reflect the
current housing market conditions and the prevailing financing environment.

At the year end, the net realisable value provision amounts to £nil (31 October 2018: £400,000). This provision will be closely monitored
for adequacy and appropriateness as regards under and over provision to reflect circumstances at future balance sheet dates.

Government grants are recognised as deferred income and are allocated to the income statement over the useful lives of the related
assets. The effect of this treatment is to reduce the fair value of work in progress by £11,665,000 (31 October 2018: £9,875,000) and
to reduce cost of sales in the income statement by £2,299,000 (31 October 2018: £2,011,000).

**19** **Retirement benefit schemes**

**Keepmoat Pension Plan**

The Group operates the Keepmoat Limited Group Pension Plan (“KPP”), a defined contribution plan, with assets held in independently
administered funds. Some members of the KPP have a contractual promise from the Group, which is separate to the benefits payable
by the KPP, being an arrangement between Keepmoat Limited and the applicable employees. The obligation arising under this
arrangement has been calculated by a qualified independent actuary and accounted for as a long-term employee benefit. The contractual
liabilities are measured using the projected unit actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality
corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.

The major assumptions used by the actuary to calculate the liabilities of the defined benefit obligation are:

**Defined contribution schemes**

The pension cost charged to the income statement in respect of the defined contribution scheme during the period was £1,542,000 (31
October 2018: £759,000) representing contributions payable in the year. Contributions due to the defined contribution schemes at the
period end were £137,503 (31 October 2018: £98,000).

**20** **Contingent liabilities**

The Group has entered into performance guarantees in the normal course of business which, at 31 October 2019, amounted to £14.0m
(31 October 2018: £8.7m). In the opinion of the directors, no loss will arise in respect of these guarantees.

The Group has given guarantees in respect of the bank borrowings in addition to performance and other guarantees. At 31 October
2019 the Group had bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility of £7,500,000 (31 October 2018: £37,500,000) and bank
overdrafts of £6,311,000 (31 October 2018: £29,155,000). The Group therefore had undrawn facilities totalling £41,189,000 (31 October
2018: £8,345,000). The guarantees are in the form of floating charges over the assets of certain Group companies.

The Group is party to the Keystone Midco Limited Group (“Midco Group”) senior facility agreement whereby the Midco Group has a
revolving credit facility with a maximum facility of £55,000,000. At 31 October 2019 the Midco Group was in a net cash position (31

**Capital risk management**

The Group’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders by ensuring that the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to sustain its present
and forecast operations.

The Group monitors current and forecast cash liquidity and bond liquidity against available facilities to ensure that there is sufficient
capacity to meet requirements for the foreseeable future.

As part of its covenants, the Group also measures its leverage requirement as a ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net debt. The leverage
covenant requirement reduces over time. At 31 October 2019, the ratio of 1.96 for the year was within the required ratio of 5.44 (at 31
October 2018, the ratio of 2.94 for the year was within the required ratio of 4.30).

**Financial risks and management**

The Group’s principal financial instruments comprised a term, RCF facility, bank loans, development land payables, subordinated
shareholder loan notes, and cash. The main purpose of these financial instruments and to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The
Group has other financial instruments including trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations.

No trading in financial instruments has been undertaken.

The Group has exposure to a variety of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. The Board reviews and agrees policies for
managing risk as well as specific policies and guidelines.

The key financial risks resulting from the Group’s use of financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.

**a)** **Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations mainly arising on the Group’s
trade receivables and amounts due from construction contract customers.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited for open market housebuilding activities as the Group typically receives cash at the point
of legal completion of its sales.

The credit risk on registered provider sales depends on the individual characteristics of the counterparty many of whom are in the public
sector or are funded by the public sector (e.g. housing associations). The Board consider that the credit rating of these customers is
good and the credit risk on outstanding balances to be low and no provision is held against these balances (31 October 2018: £nil).

The Group does not have any concentration of risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract receivables or trade receivable
balances, with receivables spread across a wide range of customers.

The ageing of trade receivables (see note 12) is as follows:

The Group applies the simplified approach under IFRS 9 to measure expected credit losses (“ECL”) associated with trade and other
receivables. The carrying value of receivables is reduced at each reporting date for any increase in the lifetime ECL with an impairment
loss recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. The Directors are of the opinion that there is a significant concentration of

**21   Financial instruments (continued)**

credit risk for those balances past due greater than one year. Trade receivables with a carrying amount of £10.5m (31 October 2018:
£8.1m) are past due at the reporting date and £0.8m are impaired (31 October 2018: £1.6m).

**a)** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. An ageing profile of the
Group’s loans and borrowings is presented in note 15.

The Group’s objective is to manage liquidity by ensuring that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they become
due. This will be assessed under normal and stress conditions, without incurring losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

Following the refinancing of the senior secured notes and the refinancing of the revolving credit facility the Group has released a further
£22m of liquidity.

The Group has rigorous cash management processes. Cash balances are reported daily with detailed analysis of variances to short
term cash forecasts. Short term cash forecasts are updated monthly and are for a period of 26 weeks with the first 8 weeks on a daily
basis and the remaining 18 weeks on a weekly basis. These complement a minimum of four long term quarterly cash forecasts each
year which are compared to the annual cash flow budget and to previous quarterly forecasts. These facilitate management’s
assessments of the Group’s expected cash performance and the associated comparison to available facilities and the Group’s
covenants.

Key risks to liquidity and cash balances are a decrease in the value of open market sales, a downturn in the UK housing market,
deterioration in credit terms obtainable in the market from suppliers and subcontractors, a downturn in the profitability of work, delayed
receipt of cash from customers and a general decline in the ability of local authorities to fund urban regeneration projects.

In order to mitigate this risk, the Group continually monitors open market house sales volumes and prices; working capital levels and
contract profitability; and both client and supplier credit references and credit terms with clients and suppliers to ensure they continue to
be appropriate.

The Group does not have any derivative financial liabilities.

**b)** **Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates, house prices and foreign exchange rates will affect the Group
income or the value of the Group’s financial instruments.

_Interest rate risk_

Interest rate risk relates to the impact of interest rate increases on the Group’s floating rate borrowing. Following the refinancing during
the year, the Group now holds facilities at floating interest rates at a margin over the London Interbank Borrowing Rate (LIBOR). This
new financing has increased the liquidity of the Group but also the Group’s exposure to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. Whilst the
risk of an increase in interest rate is beyond the Group’s control, management continually keeps this exposure under review.

_Housing market risk_

The Group is affected by price fluctuations in the UK housing market. The market is impacted by consumer demand and employment
levels and is dependent on the availability of mortgage finance. Furthermore, Government incentives, such as the “Help to Buy” scheme,
have helped to stimulate consumer demand. Whilst these risks are beyond the Group’s ultimate control, risk is spread across differing
business activities undertaken by the Group and the geographical regions in which it operates.

_Currency risk_

The Group operates entirely in the United Kingdom and all of the Group’s revenue is generated in the United Kingdom and is
denominated in pounds sterling. Consequently, the Group has very limited exposure to currency risk

**21    Financial instruments (continued)**

**Fair values of financial instruments**

_Trade and other receivables_

The fair value of trade and other receivables, excluding contract assets, is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted
at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material. The carrying amount of trade and other receivables is a
reasonable approximation of their fair value.

_Trade and other payables_

The fair value of trade and other payables, excluding contract liabilities, is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted
at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material. The carrying amount of trade and other payables is a
reasonable approximation of their fair value.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated at its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand.

_Loans and borrowings_

Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest
at the balance sheet date.

Prepayments and contract assets are excluded from the trade and other receivables balances. Contract liabilities, non-cash land
commitments and statutory liabilities are excluded from trade and other payables as these are not financial instruments.

_Borrowing facilities_

At 31 October 2019, the Group had committed borrowing facilities totalling £55,000,000 (31 October 2018: £75,000,000) representing
revolving credit facilities and overdraft, which are due for renewal in June 2025. At 31 October 2019 the Group had bank borrowings
under the revolving credit facility of £7,500,000 (31 October 2018: £37,500,000) and bank overdrafts of £6,311,000 (31 October 2018:
£29,155,000). The Group therefore had undrawn facilities totalling £41,189,000 (31 October 2018: £8,345,000). Revolving credit facilities
bear interest at 3.0% over LIBOR whilst cash overdrafts are 3.75% over Bank of England base rate. Performance bonds attract interest
at a flat rate of 1.875%.

### Principal company accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2019

**Basis of preparation**

The Company financial statements of Keystone Midco Limited have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (“FRS 101”) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost
convention except investment property which have been measured at fair value.

The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. All financial information is rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except
where otherwise indicated. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements have been
consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.

FRS 101 allows the income statement and balance sheet to be presented in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1

- Presentation of Financial Statements.

A summary of the disclosure exemptions adopted for the year ended 31 October 2019 is presented below. Equivalent disclosures for
financial instruments are included in the Keepmoat Midco Limited Group consolidated financial statements allowing the exemptions to
be applied.

**Area** **Disclosure exemption**

Cash flow statements Exemption from preparing a cash flow statement. (IAS 7)

Financial instrument Exemption from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments) and related IFRS
disclosures 13 disclosures.

Exemption from the disclosures in respect of management’s objectives, policies and processes
for managing capital (IAS1.134 to 136).

Related party disclosures Exemption for related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group,
provided that any subsidiary which is party to a transaction is wholly owned by such a member.

Exemption from disclosure of key management personnel compensation.

Presentation of Financial Exemption from statement of compliance with IFRS, cash flow information and capital
Statements management policy.

The Company has consistently and uniformly applied the accounting policies of the Group set out on pages 34 to 38 insofar as they are
applicable to the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and subject to the disclosure exemptions above.

**Investments**

Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are recorded in the Company’s balance sheet at cost less any impairment.
The directors review the investments for impairment when there are indicators of possible impairment.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Company’s management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.

**Impairment of investments and inter-company receivables**

Determining whether investments and inter-company receivables are impaired requires an estimate of the future discounted cash flows
of each investment or receivable. Discounted cash flows and assumptions (including discount rates, timing of cash flows and growth
prospects) are inherently subjective and largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Company.

### Strategic Report 

 Introduction

After seven years with Keepmoat Homes, I have taken the decision to step down as Chief Executive Officer. I made this decision with
the full support of the Board following the successful refinance of the business, which follows a period of very strong growth at
Keepmoat Homes which has seen the business treble in size in the last five years and following the very successful sale of Keepmoat
Regeneration two years ago. I am delighted to say that I will become a Non-Executive Director of Keepmoat Homes and remain fully
involved in that capacity.

The new financing arrangements put in place an improved debt package for the business to support its continued growth over the next
six years and offers improved terms including lower costs and increased financial capacity to ensure that Keepmoat Homes can
continue to move forward with its strategy of controlled and profitable growth. This is an extremely positive step and reflects the
confidence of our lenders in the business. The funding deal increases our total available debt facilities to £205m (previously £175m)
providing greater support for us to deliver our growth plans.  We have a pipeline of over 30,000 plots and are well positioned to
deliver our multi-tenure strategy and to continue to increase the supply of homes across the country.

We have also changed our financial year end from March to October in order to support our continued growth plans by optimising the
timing of our year-end from both a sales and build perspective.  In the resulting seven-month accounting period to 31 October 2018
we delivered 2,108 high quality new homes across the UK and recorded revenues of £324.2m. For the 12 months to October 2018 we
delivered 3,988 new homes, 271 more than the 12 months to March 2018 and we saw an increase in our revenues of 12.7% to
£597m.

Finally, I am delighted to say that Tim Beale, previously our Chief Operating Officer and Deputy CEO, has stepped up to become Chief
Executive Officer. Tim joined us in May 2017 and has made a significant contribution to the group in this time. Having spent his whole
career in the housebuilding industry, Tim’s arrival at Keepmoat followed 14 years at Crest Nicholson, latterly as a member of the
executive board and Chairman of the South West, Chiltern and Southern divisions.

I am fully confident that under Tim’s leadership the business will go from strength to strength as he focusses on what we do best –
looking after our fantastic people to ensure that we can continue to provide high quality homes that we can be proud to deliver to our
customers.

James Thomson
**Executive Director**

### Strategic Report

 Chief Executive Officer’s review

I’m pleased to have taken over the role of Chief Executive Officer at Keepmoat Homes on 6 February 2019 and thank James and the
Board Members for this opportunity. Over the last 12 months I’ve worked closely with James and our Executive team to ensure we are
consistently delivering quality new homes in the places where people need them.

Over the next year we are focusing on our operations and plan to deliver over 4,000 new homes utilising both traditional and modular
construction to help meet the country’s housing needs. We will also start on site on a number of transformational projects including
Sighthill in Glasgow, Northfleet in Kent and the Waterside in Leicester. These developments are long term commitments to the
regeneration of key UK cities and towns which embrace their heritage but build for their future.

Keepmoat Homes has continued to strengthen its position as the UK’s largest and only dedicated partnership home builder and the
leading home builder for first time buyers. We have a presence in all the top 10 markets outside London, and we are a top 10 UK
home builder, ranked 7[th] in terms of the number of homes we build across the country each year.

We work with Homes England, local authorities and registered providers to deliver much needed high-quality new homes across the
country, with many of these relationships enduring for over 20 years. We are the largest delivery partner of Homes England and have
delivered over 11,000 homes in partnership with them as a member of consecutive Delivery Partner Panels since 2009, accessing
over £177m in funding initiatives to accelerate output delivery. We have used the Home Building Fund to accelerate the delivery of
2,200 homes and Help to Buy to support the ambitions of 70% of our homebuyers. In the seven months to October 2018 we built
1,578 homes for open market sale, with 72% being built for the very important first-time buyer market.

The market for new affordable homes remains strong, supported by the availability of suitable mortgage products that make it more
affordable to buy than rent. Government commitment to new housing also remains strong and has significant cross-party support. With
the increasing demand for more new homes of all tenures to solve the UK housing crisis, Keepmoat Homes remains committed to
working with its partners including local authorities, registered providers and the private rented sector (PRS).

We sold 530 homes to registered providers and the build-to-rent market (or PRS) in the 7 months to October 2018 (25% of our total
homes built) and this underpins our multi-tenure strategy. This includes 20 homes delivered for our partner Sigma and its PRS Real
Estate Investment Trust (The PRS REIT plc), and we have a number of other sites under active consideration. These markets are
important to us as our partners increasingly want to see multi-tenure development. In addition, as part of a balanced blend, they can
help drive our financial performance by delivering additional volume and improving our return on capital which is already one of the
highest amongst our peers.

**The UK’s leading brownfield homebuilder**

Keepmoat Homes is the UK’s leading brownfield homebuilder, meaning we do more than just deliver new homes. We regenerate
urban and brownfield land to create thriving new communities. 80% of our current developments are on brownfield sites.

We are pleased to see increased support to bringing forward brownfield land from the public sector. Our work with local authorities
across the UK including in Leeds, Sheffield, Rotherham and Herefordshire provides model approaches for others to follow. For
example, through our partnership with Leeds City Council we will deliver over 1,000 new homes in East Leeds over the next 10 years
as part of the council’s ground-breaking £140m Leeds Brownfield Regeneration Programme.

**Modern Methods of Construction**

Keepmoat Homes is at the forefront of the use of Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) to accelerate delivery. We have invested
substantially in modular homes in partnership with ilke Homes and worked with their team to create a product tailored to the needs of
first-time buyers and also to the requirements of our public sector and housing association partners. We are delighted to see growing
Government support for MMC and commitment from our Housing Association partners and Homes England to include modular homes
in their delivery plans.

We see MMC adding capacity in the market and being particularly well suited for high volume developments and we have entered into
a framework agreement with ilke Homes to deliver over 400 modular homes on our developments across England over the period to
March 2020, with more to follow.

**Advanced construction techniques**

Supporting many of our procurement objectives, and vital to improving quality across the business, is our move to digital construction
and other advanced construction techniques.

Artificial intelligence, robotics, virtual reality and a host of new design, offsite manufacture and on site assembly techniques are now
being used effectively by the construction industry and Keepmoat Homes is open to challenging traditions to find solutions that
complement our current ways of working, but meet demands for speed, efficiency, productivity, certainty and quality.

### Strategic Report

 Chief Executive Officer’s review

We have digitised our range of house types and are starting to see benefits for our customers, in the ease and detail with which we
can show them their finished home, in the quality of that home, and in the improved internal efficiencies being realised at all stages of
design, procurement, construction and after-sales care.

**Government commitment to housing supply**

The Government continues to show strong commitment to the housebuilding sector with a view to meeting its target of building
300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s, thereby increasing housing supply to its highest levels since the 1970s. We are pleased
to see broad cross-party support for this commitment.

Major landmarks in support of this policy were the revised National Planning Policy Framework, the Autumn Budget and the final
report of the independent review of build-out rates, the Letwin Review. Outside these landmark policy announcements, new funding
was announced in June and September to support affordable homebuilding, local authority borrowing, land assembly and small sites.

The revised National Planning Policy Framework ensures that more land in the right places is available for housing. We welcome its
provisions for leadership at local authority and city region levels, including an emphasis on good design, broadening of the range of
affordable tenures recognised, and continued preference for brownfield development. Many of these measures can accelerate the
delivery of new homes by reducing local opposition and shortening planning processes.

Further planning reforms were announced for consultation later in the year, applying common sense to existing restrictions. New
permitted development rights will allow upwards extensions above commercial premises and residential properties, including blocks of
flats, and allow commercial buildings to be demolished and replaced with homes. At the same time, Government proposes giving
greater freedom to local authorities to dispose of land at an undervalue.

The 2018 Autumn Budget met two key requests for support. The Chancellor renewed the Help to Buy equity loan scheme for first time
buyers until March 2023 and, in a measure trailed in the Prime Minister’s speech to Conservative Party Conference, abolished the
Housing Revenue Account cap that controls local authority borrowing for house building. Alongside these flagship announcements
were another £500 million for the Housing Infrastructure Fund, support for £1 billion of lending to SME housebuilders and, addressing
a loophole for our housing association customers, Stamp Duty Land Tax relief for first time buyers of shared ownership homes.

The Letwin review into build-out rates talked the language of mixed-tenure in recommending greater diversity on large sites in areas of
high housing demand. New powers for local authorities, alongside guidance for developers, will help to avoid saturation of local
markets. We will find out in 2019 whether the Government welcomes this approach or feels it needs to do more to force the build out
of planning consents.

**Support for first-time buyers**

The Government further demonstrated its commitment to helping first time buyers by eliminating stamp duty on their purchases of
homes up to the value of £500,000 including shared ownership properties. We welcome the extension of Help to Buy to 2023 and the
reforms to restrict support to only first time buyers from 2021 and 2023 and with new regional caps.

With a confirmed date now in place for the end of Help to Buy, we are investing in new schemes and partnerships to ensure that we
can continue to support our core first-time-buyer market. Through additional funding accessed via Homes England Shared Ownership
and Affordable Housing Programme we are working in partnership with Heylo to deliver its Home Reach part rent, part buy, shared
ownership scheme on our developments across the country. This will allow first-time-buyers and those on lower incomes to own their
home for just 50% of the selling price with a five per cent deposit.

The alignment of Keepmoat Homes with the ambitions of Government and our public sector partners means we are optimistic about
our future at the heart of the UK housing market.

**Brexit**

The fundamental underpinnings for the UK Housing Market are strong, including Government support, health of mortgage lenders,
constrained supply, general aspiration to own a home, a high level of employment and relatively low interest rates. However, since the
UK vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, there has been an increasing amount of uncertainty for business and consumers
which is manifesting itself differently in different sectors of the housing market. Fortunately, Keepmoat, with an average sales price of
around £154,000, has remained virtually unaffected in the 7 months to October 2018 with sales across all regions remaining healthy
and in line with our expectations.

Given the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit and its economic impact the Group has continued to consider the potential effect on our
business and has carried out appropriate risk assessments. We believe that the Group’s multi tenure partnership approach and
expertise in the first-time buyer market provides some resilience should any adverse market effects arise.

We will continue to closely monitor market conditions through the coming year in light of wider political and economic developments.

### Strategic Report

 Chief Executive Officer’s review

**A regional focus on national delivery**

Keepmoat Homes is focused on delivery of high-quality affordable homes across the UK, with ten regional teams organised into three
divisions: Scotland and North West; North East and Yorkshire; and Midlands and South. The number of regional teams and their
boundaries will remain flexible allowing for growth and expansion into new areas where this makes sense and is required to enable all
offices to remain at an optimum size for effective management.

A Divisional Chairman is responsible for each of the three divisions, supported by a Divisional Finance Director. Each of the regional
teams has its own management board, applying the Group’s policies and systems to local markets and circumstances.

**A flexible multi-tenure product**

Our core market is first time buyers and first time movers, but we recognise that our partners are looking to meet a broad range of
housing needs.

Around 30% of our sales are to registered providers or to the new breed of investors in private rented sector homes, built and
designed specifically for that market. The 3,988 plots we sold in the 12 months to October 2018 were for private sale (with and without
Help to Buy), affordable or market rent and shared ownership.

**Land**

The strength, depth and sustainable nature of our partnerships with over 200 local authorities, housing associations and other
organisations, is demonstrated by the pipeline of land available to us for development.

At 31 October 2018, the number of plots within our land pipeline, including sites where we have been appointed as preferred
developer is 31,148 representing over 8 years of work ahead based on current build rates.

**Procurement**

As we grow in each of our regions, our supply chain must grow with us. Procurement is one of the core functions now represented in
each of our regions, where our buyers can respond with agility to local growth strategies and build effective relationships with local
supply chains. These local relationships are supported by our business wide Strategic Framework Agreements which leverage our
nationwide spend. Face-to-face engagement is actively encouraged. We build strategic relationships with our supply chain that help to
deliver our business goals and support sustainable growth.

Procurement is critical in managing sustainable supply chain relationships and assuring core standards and continuous improvement
in quality, safety, service, innovation and cost competitiveness. We actively manage a high-quality supply base that shares our values
and is fully aligned to supporting our growing business.

**Environmental matters and sustainability**

Keepmoat Homes recognises the significant impact that the construction industry has on our environment. Issues such as climate
change, resource depletion and water quality affect us all.

We are continuing to be at the forefront in creating places that are sustainable not only in their impact on the environment but also in
their impact on people, with key innovations including the development of specifications focused on comfort in regards to daylight,
noise, air quality and running efficiencies and the introduction of high speed broadband connections to homes to support digitally
enabled lifestyles.

Additionally, Keepmoat’s modular homes partnership with ilke Homes produces a high quality, low carbon and precision engineered
housing solution. A warm frame construction enabling a high level of air tightness and thermal performance, together with significantly
enhanced thermal bridge detailing, enables overall performance standards well in advance of building regulations. Consideration has
also been made for the enabling of renewable energies and smart controls to achieve zero carbon standards. By building smarter and
minimising our environmental impact through our design and build process, we are helping to create a more sustainable future.

**People**

Our people are at the heart of our business and we value them tremendously. We are proud of our skilled and dedicated colleagues,
who work hard to help make our business a success. We recognise that we need to continually invest in our people and ensure that
we attract, inspire and retain like-minded individuals to bolster our team and help us to deliver excellent service for our customers.

**Apprentices and trainees**

We continue to develop our skilled teams through high levels of trainees, apprentices and graduates who make up around eight per
cent of our workforce. We count over 70 apprentices and trainees as part of the team, including bricklayers, quantity surveyors, trainee
site managers and administrators.

Since mid-2018 we have been working in partnership with the Collab Group to source our apprentices and have placed over 30
apprenticeships in our business so far. We’re developing a pre employment work experience programme with Collab and BuildUK to
create opportunities for disadvantaged groups to gain access to skills in the building industry with the aim of developing the site
managers of the future.

### Strategic Report

 Chief Executive Officer’s review

**Talent development at all levels**

We are looking at better ways of developing talent throughout the full length of a career with Keepmoat Homes:

  - Talent mapping is helping us to understand what talent we have, where it is in the business and what we need to do to
develop it. It is vital in our succession planning across many key roles.

  - Our bespoke Effective Keepmoat Manager programme is currently benefitting over 50 of our colleagues as they hone their
people management skills.

  - We have signed up to the Home Building Skills Pledge of the Home Builders Federation and are active members of their
Home Building Skills Partnership.

**Keepmoat academies**

We are currently developing a potential Construction Academy which would focus on developing Trainee / Assistant Site Managers
and supporting them to become future Site Managers. This would cover not just the technical side but also include soft skills such as
managing change, resilience and motivation. This academy would harness our Construction Director’s expertise, supported by the HR
Development team and external trainers.

**Diversity**

The homebuilding industry suffers from gender imbalance, particularly at senior levels. Keepmoat Homes is committed to attracting the
right, skilled people into the organisation at all levels, regardless of gender.

We support initiatives to attract more women into the industry and see the benefits that diversity brings to the organisation. We are
working hard to break down the perceptions that have historically made the industry less attractive to women.

**Employee Diversity**

Average number of employees, split by gender, for the 7 months ended 31[st] October 2018:

**Male** **Female** **Total**

Total 736 67.1% 362 32.9% 1,098 100.0%

**Disability statement**

The Group is committed to achieving a balanced and diverse workforce and pursues an equal opportunities policy through all areas
including recruitment and selection, training and development, performance reviews, succession planning, promotion and ultimately,
retirement. It is our policy to ensure employee related decisions are made on the basis of merit and capability regardless of religion,
race, nationality, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age or disability. If members of staff become disabled the
Group is committed to continue employment wherever possible and undertakes the necessary adjustments to facilitate ongoing
employment.

### Strategic Report

 Chief Executive Officer’s review

**Modern Slavery Act 2015**

In July 2018 the group published its policy statement in accordance with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Our policy
sets out the processes and practices that we have implemented, to ensure that modern slavery has no place to survive within our
business, or within our supply chain. We monitor the effectiveness and review the implementation of this policy, regularly considering
its suitability, adequacy and effectiveness.

**Health and safety**

Keepmoat Homes is a standalone housebuilder, managing construction on site as principal contractor.

Our success in refining our approach to health and safety in that role throughout the 2017/18 financial year earned us a RoSPA Gold
Award for 2017. That accolade recognises a very high level of performance, demonstrating well-developed occupational health and
safety management systems and culture, outstanding control of risk and very low levels of error, harm and loss.

RoSPA’s recognition does not mean the job is done. Our Safety, Health, Environment and Quality (SHEQ) strategy is focussed on
three core areas:

   - Keeping people safe and healthy every day

   - Protecting and enhancing the environment

   - Being assured, informed and focussed on quality

Significant progress has been made in these areas:

   - Active and visible leadership is being provided from the top of the Group. Our senior managers not only set an example of
appropriate behaviour on site, but ensure that the Group’s expectations set a framework within which a safe culture can
become embedded.

   - Clear and robust performance standards have been developed for five high-risk activities. We are enforcing safe working
practices around plant and work at height. Our people are conscious of additional risks when assembling timber frame
structures. And we have been successful in reducing incidents of underground services being struck.

   - A new approach to inductions is ensuring that everyone on site is fully engaged in our health and safety programme. An
online training programme and test establish 100% understanding before new employees or contractors step onto a site.

   - An integrated approach to risk management is being taken that includes all stakeholders throughout all phases of a contract.
We seek to design out risk at an early stage and ensure that sound technical decisions are not lost later in the process.

   - We have ensured that our contractors have Risk Assessment and Method Statements in place, but our focus is now turning
to outcomes. We want to see that those statements have been adequately communicated, comprehended and complied
with.

Whilst our safety performance is significantly better than our peers within the HBF, the rate of improvement has stabilised, and we are
committed to driving continual improvement across all aspects of health and safety.

As the 2018/19 financial year starts, we are rolling out new systems and standards. Onsite inspections and audits will use

contemporary software to record richer data, giving us improved management information and better understanding of incident and

near miss data and trends.

Having established a SHEQ Leadership and Review Process as part of our SHEQ governance arrangements, it is our intent to review
performance throughout all levels of the organisation on a regular basis, always with the aim to improve our performance.

I would like to thank everyone who has worked for and with Keepmoat Homes for their contribution to our success and for all of their
hard work. We could not deliver the homes the UK needs without them.

### Strategic Report

 Our Vision, Mission and Values

Our vision, mission and values shape our strategy and the way we work, and mean we are a different type of housebuilder. Our
corporate strengths include our local knowledge, long term customer relationships, national and local presence, supply chain and our
ability to enhance local economies by employing local firms and creating local jobs.

**Keepmoat Vision: Building Communities, Transforming lives.**

This means that we think and act beyond bricks and mortar. As well as creating better places for people to live, we know that our
success depends on us playing our part in building the strong communities our partners and customers want.

We work with our partners to regenerate places to improve economic and social outcomes for local citizens while providing housing
choice in these areas. We focus on improving the communities we work in and the people we serve, creating significant local
economic benefits through our supply chain and local employment. Eight per cent of our workforce are trainees, apprentices and
graduates.

**Keepmoat Mission: We are committed to building long-term partnerships to deliver high-quality community regeneration**
**solutions.**

Our Mission explains how we are very different from a traditional housebuilder. It’s in what we do, and how we do it. We create long
term partnerships with large organisations who have unused land or properties. Together we build attractive, affordable and high
quality homes and communities that people want.

We bring together all facets of housing development, including design, planning and community engagement skills, to help partners
achieve their ambitions. We nurture an extensive supply chain of small and medium sized companies that support us around the
country and make that supply chain available to our public and private sector partners.

**Keepmoat Values: Straightforward, Passionate, Collaborative and Creative.**

Our Values support the vision, shape the culture and reflect how we work and behave.

   - Straightforward: We get the job done in the most efficient way. We are friendly, open and honest. In other words, the
people you could trust on any project, large or small.

   - Passionate: We care about what we do. We put pride and energy into delivering results. We give the best, so more people
can enjoy living in safe, happy communities and homes.

   - Collaborative: We work together in partnership to deliver the very best customer experience. By sharing our expertise, we
can build the very best.

   - Creative: We are proactive, flexible and resourceful. We listen, learn and deliver solutions.

**Essentials**

Our Essentials are the five basic building blocks of our business.

   - Safety: The safety of people, partners and communities is at the heart of everything we do.

   - Quality: We work to exceed our stakeholders’ expectations of our service, product and delivery.

   - Customer: We focus on delighting our customer.

   - People: Our people are the heart of our business, providing a service we are proud of.

   - Sustainability: We protect the environment, act ethically and leave a positive legacy.

### Strategic Report

 Making the Most of Our strengths

The Group’s existing strengths support our growth ambitions:

**National scale, local understanding. Keepmoat has successfully grown into a large national business with deep local roots and we**
intend to maintain that national and local approach.

**Develop our comprehensive offer. We have a broad set of skills ranging from developing partnerships with landowners,**
establishing supply chains, building houses and flats and supporting large-scale, housing-led regeneration.

**Organic growth. In the next five years we intend to increase the number of new houses we build for sale or rent by 50% – a major**
contribution to meeting the country’s housing needs. We want to build more and faster.

**Market and sector expansion. The need for more housing means we can bring our distinct approach to new markets:**

   - **Grow our core: Our core markets will remain first time buyer homes, and we will continue to work in partnership with local**
authorities and housing associations. We will continue to build our presence in this market.

   - **Enter new geographies: We continue to expand our offer into Scotland, the South West and South of England, where we**
have historically had little presence.

   - **Enter new sectors: We will enter new markets, so more housing opportunities will be created. We are expanding our**
home offer by introducing offsite manufacturing in to our developments, and are creating partnerships with financial
organisations combined with our skills and capabilities to create new homes in the private rental sector.

**Leveraging our scale. We have grown mostly by financing and delivering small and medium sized housing programmes, whether**
homes for sale or new build for rent. Now, our national scale and financial strength together with the breadth of our experience, and
depth of our skills and capabilities, mean we can compete to deliver a greater number of larger programmes and partnerships.

**Shape more partnerships. At the heart of our growth will be deeper and broader partnerships with existing and new partners. That**
requires us to understand partners’ challenges and objectives, and develop ways to help them meet their goals whether economic growth; social - tackling deprivation, improving health; environmental - reducing carbon consumption; financial - reducing operating
costs; operational - improving customer service; or strategic - developing their housing portfolios.

**Efficiency and effectiveness. As we grow bigger, we risk becoming less agile. We want the best of both worlds - being local and**
agile, almost like a small business can be. But we also want the benefits of being a large business such as professional rigour,
quality, efficiency and effectiveness in winning and delivering work. That means we share what works well, and avoid duplication and
unnecessary spend, as our customers expect.

**Building our brand. To build more homes we will need more people to choose to work for us as colleagues or with us as suppliers**
and partners. That means we need to be better understood. Our audiences need to know what we do, how we do it and why we are
both different, and better, than the competition. We need to further build our reputation and ensure that we understand our audiences’
concerns.

### Strategic Report – Principal risks and uncertainties

In the establishment of our strategic objectives we have recognised the fundamental importance of risk management in achieving the
desired outcomes. Risk management controls are integrated into our Divisional and Regional structures as well as our shared services
and continue to be enhanced as our Internal Audit function becomes embedded within the business. The risk landscape is continually
evolving however and as such we constantly appraise the internal and external factors that could impact our ability to deliver on our
business targets and overall strategy and mitigate these accordingly.

Our risk management process results in a detailed risk register being maintained for the Board and risks are reviewed regularly as part
of the management reporting process and this includes a ‘bottom up’ and ‘top down’ consideration of risks.

The principal risks identified and seen in the table below are considered as such because either individually or in combination, could
have a material adverse effect on the implementation of the business strategy, financial performance, shareholder value and returns
and reputation. Given the nature and severity of these risks, there has not been much movement since our last report for the March
year end; however we have identified a principal risk associated with our key IT systems.

### Strategic Report 

 Financial review

**Overview**
To support the continued growth plans of the business, we have changed our financial year end from March to October, optimising the
timing of our year end from both a build and sales perspective. As a consequence, this annual report addresses performance for the 7
month period to October 2018.

Continuing the controlled growth seen in previous years, Keepmoat Homes delivered revenue of £324.2m for the 7 months to 31
October 2018 on 2,103 home sales with an average selling price of £154k. To provide meaningful performance comparison we have
compared the unaudited 12 months to 31 October 2018 with the previous financial year to 31 March 2018 (FY18).  Revenues for the
12 months to 31 October 2018 grew by 13.2% to £597.0m compared with £527.2m achieved in the 12 months to 31 March 2018. The
number of home sales increased over the same period by 7.3% to 3,988 (FY18: 3,717), with average selling price increasing to £150k
(FY18: £143k[5]).

This and future growth continues to be supported by our regional expansion programme, including into relatively new regions such as
Scotland and the South West, and by our multi-tenure strategy via registered providers, the private rented sector, and open market
sales.

Contribution[1] for the 7 months to 31 October 2018 was £55.0m, with Adjusted EBIT[3] of £24.2m and adjusted operating profit[4] of
£23.7m. Operating cash flows from continuing activities were an outflow of £20.5m, which was principally driven by continued
investment in land and build work in progress in order to support future growth plans.

For the 12 months to October 2018 contribution increased by 9.8% to £96.4m, compared to £87.8m achieved in the 12 months to
March 2018, with adjusted EBIT increasing by 10.4% to £45.7m (FY18: £41.4m). Adjusted operating profit for the 12 month period
was £41.6m (FY18: £39.8m); an increase of 5.0%.

In order to provide clearer visibility of the underlying performance of the Group, the Board elect to measure profits on an adjusted
basis alongside other key KPIs as follows:

### Strategic Report 

 Financial review

**Refinancing**

On 16 November 2018, the Keystone JVco Limited Group (the Group) signed agreements to put in place a debt package for the next
six years to support the Group’s growth. The new facilities provide the Group with increased liquidity on lower interest rates.

This refinancing was executed on 11 December 2018, when the Group drew down a £150.0m term loan facility attracting interest of
6.5% plus Libor due for repayment in December 2024. On the same date the Group redeemed its £100.0m senior secured notes at
par. The Group did not incur any repayment penalties on redeeming its senior secured notes.

On 11 December 2018 the Group repaid in full its £37.5m revolving credit facility and on the same day drew down new debt in the
form of a £27.5m revolving credit facility. The new facility is a super senior revolving credit facility with a limit of £27.5m due for
renewal in June 2025 attracting interest at a rate of 3.0% plus Libor. On the same day the Group repaid its overdraft and drew down a
new overdraft as part of the super senior revolving credit facility giving a combined total facility of £55.0m. The outcome of the
refinancing is that the Group’s liquidity has increased by £22m after refinancing costs.

**Exceptional items**

There were no exceptional items during the 7 month period to 31 October 2018. During the previous financial year to 31 March 2018
exceptional items amounted to a net charge of £17.6m. This included £13.2m of losses recognised on a number of sites within the
West Midlands region where significant trading issues warranted separate presentation as exceptional items given their size and
nature. Losses on sites were fully provided against in the year ended 31 March 2018 and there were no further exceptional costs
relating to the West Midlands region during the current period. Other exceptional costs in the previous financial year included
restructuring costs of £4.2m in aggregate, relating both to the closure of the West Midlands regional office and to wider Group
restructuring following the disposal of the Regeneration division in April 2017.

**Financing costs**

Financing costs in the 7 month period were £12.1m (FY18: £35.0m) leading to a cash outflow of £11.2m (FY18: £30.0m). The prior
year includes £7.7m of early repayment penalties on the senior secured loan notes. The charge includes non-cash amounts of £2.6m
(FY18: £3.0m) in respect of the unwind of discount on deferred land payments.

**Taxation**

The current period tax charge of £2.3m (FY18: £3.8m credit) is made up of a current tax charge of £2.3m offset by a deferred tax
credit of £1.3m.

**Net debt and leverage**

Net debt in the wider Keystone JVco Group at 31 October 2018 was £148.5m (31 March 2018: £112.8m). Excluding shareholder loans
and preference shares, net debt was £138.5m (31 March 2018: £102.4m). This corresponds to a leverage of 3.0x (31 March 2018:
2.4x) based on adjusted last 12 months EBITDA of £46.8m (31 March 2018: £43.1m).

**Working capital**

The amount of working capital required to service the Group’s operations is closely monitored and controlled, and forms a key part of
the management information reviewed on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Current assets mainly comprise trade receivables, work
in progress and land held for the development of private housing and affordable housing through partnership schemes. As the Group’s
trade receivables relate mainly to public sector and Housing Association clients, there is no significant history of bad or doubtful debts.

**Performance bond facilities**

The Group, like most construction businesses, may in some cases rely on the use of performance bonds issued by surety companies
to our clients. The directors are pleased to report that the Group has adequate performance bonding lines in place with surety
companies to meet the Group’s growth plans.

### Directors’ Report

The directors present their annual report and the consolidated audited financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31
October 2018.

**Principal activities**

Keystone Midco Limited is an investment holding company heading a group of companies, which, since the disposal of the
Regeneration division, are engaged in the construction of residential dwellings.

The Company’s subsidiaries are listed in note 25 to the financial statements.

**Business review and future developments**

The consolidated profit for the financial period was £9.7m, (31 March 2018: £115.8m of which £131.5m was related to the sale of the
Regeneration business). The Company did not pay a dividend during the period (31 March 2018: £170,387,000 amounting to
£170,387,000per ordinary share), no final dividend is proposed (31 March 2018: £nil). A review of the results, performance and future
developments for the Group are presented in the Strategic Report on pages 3 to 15 which forms part of this report.

**Post balance sheet events**

On 11 December 2018 the Group repaid its existing debt facilities and drew down a senior term loan, revolving credit facility and
overdraft, for more details see note 27.

**Going concern**

The directors have considered the adequacy of the Group’s financial resources through a review of the financial projections for the
business and taking into account the refinancing of the Group’s debt post year end. The Group’s existing senior secured loan notes
were due for repayment on 15 October 2019. These were settled on 11 December 2018 and the Group drew down a new facility on
the same day.  The new debt facility gives the Group an additional £22m of funding and attracts interest at a rate of 6.5% over Libor
and so reduces finance costs. The new facility is due for repayment in December 2024. After careful consideration the directors are
satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from
the date of signing the financial statements. For this reason the directors continue to apply the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.

**Financial risk management**

In the course of its ordinary activities, the Group is exposed to financial risks which include liquidity, credit and interest rate risks.
These risks are monitored and managed through robust policies and procedures. Further details are included in Note 23 of the
financial statements.

Liquidity risk relates to the Group generating sufficient cash flow to meet its operational requirements while avoiding debt covenant
breaches or excessive debt levels. Total borrowings are a combination of long term loans and long term committed revolving working
capital credit facilities.

Credit risk is in relation to trade receivables from customers. Given that the majority of trade receivables are with public and regulated
organisations, the exposure to credit risk is extremely limited.

Interest rate risk relates to the impact of interest rate increases on the Group’s floating rate borrowings. At present the Group’s
revolving credit and overdraft facilities are all on a floating rate. The Group’s long term borrowings were at fixed rates of interest, but
the Group’s interest rate risk has increased following refinancing as its new £150m term loan is at a floating rate of interest.

**Directors**

The directors who held office during the period and up to the date of signing the financial statements are given below:

M A Budd

E J C Hawkes

S J Robertson

J M D Thomson

M R Priest

T M Beale

M A Budd, E J C Hawkes and S J Robertson are representatives of the Company’s shareholders, being TDR Capital LLP which has
effective control of 85% of the issued share capital of the Company whilst Sun Capital Partners has effective control of the remaining
15%.

In accordance with the Articles of Association, none of the directors are required to retire by rotation.

**Employees**

The Group believes that its success depends upon its employees and their development. Further details are provided within the
Strategic Report.

### Directors’ Report

**Directors’ indemnities**

The Group maintains liability insurance for its directors and officers which remains in place up to the date of this Annual Report. The
Group has also provided an indemnity for its directors, which is a qualifying third party indemnity provision for the purposes of the
Companies Act 2006.

**Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements**

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulation.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period. Under that law the directors have
prepared the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law). Under company
law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the group and company and of the profit or loss of the group and company for that period. In preparing the financial
statements, the directors are required to:

   - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

   - state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the group financial statements
and whether United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the company financial
statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

   - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

   - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and
company will continue in business.

The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the group and
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and company and enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.

**Walker Guidelines**

The directors consider the annual report and financial statements to comply with all aspects of the guidelines for transparency and
disclosure in private equity owned companies.

**Directors’ confirmations**

In the case of each director in office at the date the Directors’ Report is approved:

   - so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the group and company’s auditors are
unaware; and

   - they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the group and company’s auditors are aware of that information.

**Independent auditors**

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited

# Report on the audit of the group financial statements

**Our opinion**

In our opinion, Keystone Midco Limited’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”):

     - give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 October 2018 and of its profit and cash
flows for the 7 month period (the “period”) then ended;

     - have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union; and

     - have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Financial Statements (the “Annual
Report”), which comprise: the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 October 2018; the consolidated income statement and
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the consolidated
statement of changes in equity for the 7 month period then ended; the principal consolidated accounting policies; and
the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

_Independence_

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

**Our audit approach**

_Overview_

                 - Overall group materiality: £860,000 (12 month period ended 31 Mar 2018:
£1,400,000), based on 5% of profit before tax from continuing activities,
adjusted for interest on senior secured loan notes.

                 - For the 7 month financial period the group has operated as a single Homes
division. The Homes division consists of two statutory entities which, in our
view, represent the components.

                 - There are also a number of other group entities that contain financially
significant balances which, in our view, required an audit of these specific
financial statement line items.

                 - The two components over which we performed audit work represent all of the
group's revenue from continuing operations and substantially all of the group's
operating profit. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the
group financial statements as a whole.

                 - Carrying value of land and build work in progress.

                 - Assessments of costs to complete.

_The scope of our audit_

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect
of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently
uncertain.

As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating
whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

_Key audit matters_

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit
of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material

misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on:
the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

**_Key audit matter_** **_How our audit addressed the key audit matter_**


_Carrying value of land and build work in progress_

We focused upon this area because the value of the
group's land and work in progress represent a significant
proportion of assets in the group statement of financial
position and determining the carrying value of land and
work in progress requires a high degree of judgement.

The key judgements can be effected by market conditions
and unexpected events.

_Assessments of costs to complete_

We focused upon this area because determining
the carrying value of land and work in progress requires a
high degree of judgement.

The key judgements regarding forecasting future costs to
complete can be effected by market conditions and
unexpected events.

_How we tailored the audit scope_


We assessed the adequacy of controls over site valuations,
including costs to complete, site budget approvals, and the
authorisation and recording of costs, including testing of
controls over the allocation of costs to the correct sites.

We visited a sample of sites to confirm the existence and
condition of the work in progress, and also to evaluate the
reasonableness of the assessment of stage of completion.

We assessed the accuracy of management’s forecasting of
site development profit against actual profits recorded.

We sample tested and agreed certain costs incurred
during the year included within land and build work in
progress to supporting evidence as well as reviewing the
proportion of that expenditure recognised as a cost of sale
in the year in respect of units sold.

We discussed a sample of sites with central and regional
management in order to assess the reasonableness of net
realisable values and corroborated the explanations
received back to supporting documentation where
appropriate.

We performed an assessment of land and build provisions
via enquiry and corroboration to supporting evidence.

We tested the reconciliations from the site cashflows to
the accounting system.

We assessed the adequacy of controls over site valuations,
including costs to complete, site budget approvals, and the
authorisation and recording of costs, including testing of
controls over the allocation of costs to the correct sites.

We visited a sample of sites to confirm the existence and
condition of the work in progress, and also to evaluate the
reasonableness of the assessment of stage of completion.

We assessed the accuracy of management’s forecasting of
site development profit against actual profits recorded.

We substantiated a sample of costs to complete per site
cost-valuation reports to supporting documentation.

We tested a sample of period end cost-valuation reports
agreed to the site cashflows.


We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the
financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls,
and the industry in which it operates.

The group has only one division consists of two statutory entities which, in our view, required an audit of their complete
financial information due to their size.

There are also a number of other group entities that contain financially significant balances which, in our view, required
an audit of these specific financial statement line items. Specific audit procedures over exceptional items, administrative
expenses, finance expenses, borrowings, and provisions were performed across these other components.

The components over which we performed audit work represent all of the group's revenue from continuing operations
and substantially all of the group's operating profit. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the group
financial statements as a whole.

All work was performed by the group audit team.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited

_Materiality_

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and
in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

**_Overall group materiality_** £860,000 (12 month period ended 31 Mar 2018: £1,400,000).

**_How we determined it_** 5% of profit before tax from continuing activities, adjusted for interest on senior
secured loan notes.


**_Rationale for benchmark_**
**_applied_**


The key objective of the group is to deliver profitable growth to increase long-term
shareholder value. Due to the current capital structure of the group, we believe an
adjusted profit basis is the appropriate benchmark to use in setting materiality.


For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was £700,000 and £820,000. Certain components
were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above
£55,000 (12 month period ended 31 Mar 2018: £70,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view,
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when:

     - the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is
not appropriate; or

     - the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may
cast significant doubt about the group’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting
for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

We have nothing to report in respect of the above matters.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern. For example, the terms on which the United Kingdom may withdraw
from the European Union, which is currently due to occur on 29 March 2019, are not clear, and it is difficult to evaluate
all of the potential implications on the company’s trade, customers, suppliers and the wider economy.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and
our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material
inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material
misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report
that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us
also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

_Strategic Report and Directors’ Report_

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report
and Directors’ Report for the period ended 31 October 2018 is consistent with the financial statements and has been
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we
did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements_

As explained more fully in the Statement of the Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the financial statements set out
on page 16, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the
applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

_Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

_Use of this report_

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions,
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose
hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

# Other required reporting

**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

     - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

     - certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

# Other matter

We have reported separately on the company financial statements of Keystone Midco Limited for the 7 month period
ended 31 October 2018.

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018

**General information**

Keystone Midco Limited (the Company) is a private limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of the
registered office is Keystone Midco Limited, The Waterfront, Lakeside Boulevard, Doncaster, DN4 5PL. The nature of the Group’s
operations and its principal activities are set out in the strategic report.

The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because the Group operates exclusively in the United Kingdom. All financial
information is rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except where otherwise indicated.

**Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except investment property, available for sale
financial assets and retirement benefit assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements have been consistently applied
to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.

**Discontinued operations**

Where a major line of business has been disposed of or has been classified as held for sale, the business activity has been treated as
a discontinued operation. The Regeneration segment of the business has been treated as a discontinued operation (note 7) in the
prior year. The transaction completed on 30 April 2017. The post-tax profit from discontinued operations for the proceeding period is
presented as a single line on the Consolidated Income Statement.

**Going concern**

The directors have considered the adequacy of the Group’s financial resources through a review of the financial projections for the
business and taking into account the refinancing of the Group’s debt post year end. The Group’s existing senior secured loan notes
were due for repayment on 15 October 2019, these were settled on 11 December 2018. The Group drew down a new facility on the
same day.  The new debt facility gives the Group an additional £22m of funding and attracts interest at a rate of 6.5% over Libor, so
reduces finance costs. The new facility is due for repayment in December 2024. After careful consideration the directors are satisfied
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the date
of signing the financial statements. For this reason the directors continue to apply the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.

**Adoption of new and revised standards**

At the date of approving these financial statements, the following new and revised standards and interpretations were in issue but
were not yet effective (and in some cases had not been adopted by the EU). None of these revised standards and interpretations
have been adopted early by the Group.

- IAS 19 (Amended) – Employee benefits

- IAS 27 (Amended) - Separate financial statements

- IAS 28 (Amended) - Investments in associates and joint ventures

- IFRS 7 (Amended) - Financial instruments: Disclosures

- IFRS 16 (Amended) - Leases

With the exception of those mentioned below, the directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in
future periods will have a material effect on the financial position or performance of the Group and Company.

**IFRS 16 – Leases**

The IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases in January 2016. The standard sets out principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation
and disclosure of leases. The standard is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019, for the Group transition to
IFRS 16 will take place on 1 November 2019. The Group will not early adopt the standard.

IFRS 16 removes the long-standing distinction between finance leases and operating leases and introduces a single lessee
accounting model, with some limited exemptions for short-term leases of less than 12 months and leases of low-value assets, based
on a ‘right to use’ principle.

The Group is in the process of quantifying the implications of the new standard, but expects the following impacts:

   - There is expected to be an increase in total assets, as leased assets, currently accounted for off balance sheet (ie. classed
as operating leases under IAS 17) will be recognised on balance sheet. The biggest asset category impacted for the Group
is expected to be land and buildings.

28


-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018

**IFRS 16 – Leases (continued)**

   - There is expected to be an increase in debt, as liabilities relating to operating leases are recognised.

   - Operating lease expenditure will be reclassified and split between depreciation and finance costs. Therefore EBITDA will
increase.

**Restatement of comparatives**

The Company has adopted IFRS 15 from 1 April 2018. The Company has applied IFRS15 in accordance with the fully retrospective
transitional approach without using the practical expedients for completed contracts. The financial statements and notes impacted are:

   - Consolidated income statement

   - Consolidated balance sheet

   - Consolidated statement of comprehensive income

   - Consolidated cashflow statement

   - Note 13 inventories

   - Note 14 trade and other receivables

   - Note 16 trade and other payables

   - Note 23 financial instruments

See note 26 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Keystone Midco Limited, its subsidiary undertakings and the Group’s share
of the results of joint ventures and associates.

(a) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the
date that control ceases.

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a
subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for
control of the acquiree. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed in administrative costs as incurred. All identifiable assets and
liabilities acquired and contingent liabilities assumed are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest as compared with the Group’s share of the
identifiable net assets are recognised as goodwill. Where the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the total
consideration transferred, a gain from a bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the income statement after the fair values
initially determined have been reassessed.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised
losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Accounting
policies of acquired subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with accounting policies adopted by the Group.

(b) Joint ventures

Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, interest in joint ventures is initially
recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in
other comprehensive income.

Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds its equity accounted investment in a joint venture, the carrying amount of the equity
interest is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or
constructive obligations. Appropriate adjustment is made to the results of joint ventures where material differences exist between a
joint venture’s accounting policies and those of the Group.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is
impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of the impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of
the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in the income statement adjacent to its share of profit/(loss) from
associates.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the
joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred.

29


-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018

(c) Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method, applying the same
policy as set out for joint ventures above.

**Segmental reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments
has been identified as Keepmoat Limited Group’s executive directors.

**Non-current assets held for sale**

Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a
sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset (or disposal group) is
available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or
disposal groups) and the sale is highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.

When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary
are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling
interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.

Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell.

**Revenue and profit recognition**

The Group accounts for revenue using IFRS 15. Revenue is recognised based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks
and rewards are transferred. This can lead to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual
arrangements in place. Primarily, for those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from registered providers of housing,
revenue will be recognised based on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. The majority of the Group’s revenue and
profit, including revenue from open market sales, will continue to be recognised on legal completion.

_Sale of housing to open market customers_

Revenue and profits associated with these activities are included in the financial statements on legal completion.

Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable
upon legal completion. Open market sale plots are recognised at the agreed sales price deemed to be fair value.

_Sale of housing to registered provider customers – with stage payments_

The Group constructs and sells residential properties under long-term contracts with customers. Such contracts are entered into
before construction of residential properties begins. Under the terms of the contracts, the Group is continually restricted from
redirecting the properties to another customer and has an enforceable right to payment for work done. Revenue from construction
of residential properties is therefore recognised over time on a stage of completion method. The directors consider that this
method is an appropriate measure of the progress towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations under IFRS 15.

On the balance sheet, the Group reports the net contract position for each contract as either an asset or a liability. A contract
represents an asset where costs incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses) exceed progress billings; a contract
represents a liability where the opposite is the case.

_Sale of housing to registered provider customers – without stage payments_

Revenue and profits associated with these activities are included in the financial statements on legal completion as this is the point
at which control is passed from the Group to the purchaser.

Claims on customers or third parties for variations to the original contract are recognised in the income statement once entitlement
to the claim has been established.

Claims by customers or third parties in respect of work carried out are recognised in the income statement once the obligation to
transfer economic benefit has become probable.

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding
of the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the
significance of their nature or amount.

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of
the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired at the acquisition date. It is recognised as an asset and reviewed for
impairment at least annually or when there is a triggering event, by considering the net present value of future cash flows. For the
purposes of testing for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the
value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement.

Where the fair value of the consideration given is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired,
the difference is immediately recognised in the income statement as a gain from a bargain purchase.

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating
units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.

**Intangible assets**

Other intangible assets, such as those identified on acquisition by the Group that have finite lives, are recognised at fair value and
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

Intangible assets are being amortised over the following periods, with amortisation being charged to cost of sales unless otherwise
stated:

- Contracted customer relationships – in line with expected profit generation, over a term of seven years

- Land development rights – in line with expected profit generation, varying from one to twenty years

- Computer software – on a straight line basis over three years. (Amortisation expense is included in administrative expenses)

Intangible assets with a finite useful economic useful life are tested for impairment when there is an indication that the intangible asset
may be impaired.

**Property, plant and equipment**

All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.

The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Depreciation is
calculated so as to write off the cost of each asset, less their estimated residual value, on a straight line basis over their estimated
useful economic lives, or until the date of disposal.

The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:

%

Freehold properties 2

Leasehold property improvements over the lease term

Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings 10 - 50

No depreciation is provided on freehold land

**Investment Properties**

Investment properties are initially measured at cost, being purchase price including directly attributable expenditure. Investment
properties are subsequently measured at fair value.

**Operating leases**

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

The Group rents surplus property under short and medium-term arrangements. Income is recognised over the period of lease when
the Group can reliably measure likely flow of economic benefits. These are treated as operating lease arrangements.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method, less loss allowance. The loss allowance is calculated based on historic loss rates from payment profiles of sales in prior
periods. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting
the debtor’s ability to settle the receivable.

In respect of accounting for trade and other receivables, the Group has applied IFRS 9’s simplified approach to provisioning and has
calculated this using lifetime expected losses. This calculation has had no material impact on the financial statements.

-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018

When a trade receivable is wholly or partially uncollectible, any uncollectible amount is written off against the loss allowance.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the loss allowance. Changes in the carrying amount of
the loss allowance are recognised in the income statement.

**Impairment of financial assets**

IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model, rather than an incurred credit loss model to be applied. This requires the assessment
of the expected credit loss on each class of financial asset at each reporting date. This assessment takes into consideration changes
in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset.

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been reduced. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows

For loans and receivables, the amount of impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of
estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of financial assets is reduced by the
impairment loss directly for all financial assets except trade receivables.

Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period,
the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.

**Inventories**

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

(a) Land held for and under development

Land held for and under development includes land purchase costs and costs directly attributable to enhancing land value.

Land may be acquired at a reduced cost, with a commitment to subsequently sell plots at a similarly reduced selling price to the
vendor of the land. In such cases the value of the land is adjusted to reflect its fair value, while the discount on the sale of plots is
recognised as deferred income within development land payables.

(b) House building developments in progress

House building developments in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct expenditure,
together with an appropriate proportion of production overheads. Net realisable value represents the estimated amount at which
inventory could be realised after allowing for costs of completion and realisation.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with bank and
other short-term highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are also included, as they are an
integral part of the Group’s cash management. In the consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in
current liabilities.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms,
particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate and
subsequently held at amortised cost. The discount to the nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to
finance costs using the effective interest rate. Changes in estimates of the final payment due are taken to inventory (land held for and
under development) and in due course, to cost of sales in the income statement.

32


-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018

**Loans and borrowings**

Interest bearing bank loans, senior secured notes and other borrowings are recorded initially at their fair value, net of direct transaction
and debt issue costs.

Such instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, including commitment fees, arrangement fees
and any other costs directly related to the borrowings are recognised over the term of the instrument using the effective rate of
interest.

Any instrument repaid before the end of the contractual term will result in any unamortised costs being immediately recognised in the
income statement.

**Equity instruments**

Equity instruments such as ordinary share capital issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of directly
attributable incremental issue costs. Proceeds are allocated between nominal value and share premium.

**Income tax**

Income tax expense represents the current and deferred tax charges.

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.

Current tax is the Group’s expected tax liability on taxable profits for the year using tax rates substantively enacted at the reporting
date and any adjustment to tax in respect of previous years. Where current tax losses are available but not utilised in the period, a
deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is considered recoverable.

Taxable profit differs from that reported in the income statement because it is adjusted for items of income or expense that are
assessable or deductible in other years, or are never assessable or deductible.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax rates used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised in full if future
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are only offset to the extent that that there is a legally enforceable right to
offset current tax assets and liabilities.

**Government grants**

Government grants are recognised at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions
attaching to them and the grants will be received. Grants related to purchase of assets are recognised against assets and unwound
over the useful lives of the related assets.

**Retirement benefit obligations**

(a) Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as they accrue. Differences between contributions
payable in the year and contributions actually paid are included within either accruals or prepayments on the balance sheet.

(b) Defined benefit plans

For defined benefit plans the Group’s retirement benefit obligation is recognised on the balance sheet and represents the deficit or
surplus in the Group’s defined benefit scheme. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary on an annual basis. The scheme
assets are measured using market values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit actuarial method and are
discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.

The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme expected to arise from employee
service in the period is charged to operating profit. Finance income on the scheme's assets and the increase during the period in the
present value of the scheme's liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included in net interest cost. Actuarial gains and losses
are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising on curtailment and settlements are
taken to the income statement as incurred.

33


-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018

**Provisions**

Provisions for remedial contract obligations, vacant property obligations and restructuring costs are recognised when: the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation; and the amount has can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The
increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group’s management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions
are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised.

The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year are addressed below.

- **Goodwill and intangible assets**

IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired tangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value such
intangible assets require the use of estimates. Future results are impacted by the length of amortisation periods adopted, and
changes to the estimated useful lives which would result in different effects on the income statement and balance sheet.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, along with finite life intangible assets and other assets of the Group’s
cash generating units. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions (including discount rates, timing of
cash flows and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective.

- **Fair value on land acquired at a discount to market value**

Where the Group enters into specific arrangements with partners who provide discounted land in return for the provision of social
housing, the fair value of the housing units provided, which equates to the open market value of the discount to land, is reflected in the
financial statements. Land value in the balance sheet is therefore reflected at its fair value with this fair value being released to
revenue and cost of sales as the land is sold.

- **Estimation of costs to complete, work in progress and contract provisions**

In order to determine the profit and loss that the Group is able to recognise on its developments in a specific period, the Group has to
allocate total costs to the developments between the proportion completing in the period and the proportion to complete in a future
period. The assessment of total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation. However, Group management has established
internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made on an individual site basis.

- **Discounting of development land payables**

Where the Group enters into long-term payable arrangements with vendors of land, the Group discounts the value of land acquired to
reflect the time value of money. The Group relies on forecast future land payment dates and an estimated cost of the Group’s
incremental capital cost to perform the discounting calculation.

**Site losses**

Exceptional site losses related to a number of sites arising within the West Midlands region where significant trading issues, including
significant cost over-runs that were not adequately managed, resulted in site losses which, by size of loss and nature, warrant a
separate presentation as exceptional items. Losses on sites were fully provided against in the year ended March 2018, with trading on
all such sites completed no later than the end of the current financial period. To ensure profitable on-going trading, following detailed
review, the decision was taken to close the West Midlands regional office, with the site portfolio rationalised and the management of
on-going profitable sites successfully transferred to other regional offices, fully sustaining the presence of the Group within the
Midlands region as a whole.

**Restructuring costs**

Following the disposal of the Regeneration division a corporate restructuring exercise, including redundancies, was undertaken during
the year ended March 2018 to reflect the significant change in the size and focus of the Group. As part of this a one-off supply-chain
re-engineering process was undertaken supported by external consultants. In addition, the West Midlands regional office was closed,
as described above. Exceptional restructuring costs relate to redundancy costs and consultancy fees associated with these actions.

**Onerous lease provision**

As part of the restructuring of the West Midlands region, during the year ended 31 March 2018 the Group made an onerous lease
provision in respect of the lease obligation for the regional office at Coleshill, which has become surplus to on-going operational
requirements.

**Acquisition related fees**

During the year ended 31 March 2018 the Group incurred advisor fees related to abortive merger and acquisition activity

**Disposal of shared equity portfolio**

A deferred tax asset amounting to £20,537,000 (31 March 2018: £22,047,000) in relation to certain losses within the Group has not
been recognised as the Directors are of the opinion that there is a doubt over the recoverability of this asset due to the level of taxable
profits in the relevant entities and the impact of the loss utilisation rules that were introduced from 1 April 2017.

**Disposal of Regeneration business**

On 30 April 2017, the Group disposed of 100% of its Regeneration business. The proceeds of the sale substantially exceeded the
carrying amount of the related net assets and, accordingly, no impairment losses were recognised on the classification of these
operations as held for sale.

The prior year addition to Goodwill relates to a hindsight adjustment on the Group’s acquisition of MCI Developments Limited in
January 2017.

**Impairment review of goodwill**

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. In testing
goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the recoverable amount has been determined from value in use calculations. The
key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the forecast revenue and profit, discount rates and long-term
growth rates by market sector. Future forecast revenue is based on management’s knowledge of actual results from prior years and
latest forecasts for the current year, along with secured works, management’s expectation of the future level of work available within
the market sector and expected changes in selling volumes and prices for completed houses. In establishing future profit margins, the
margins currently being achieved are considered in conjunction with expected inflation rates in each cost category and the current
market value of land being acquired.

Cash flows beyond the five year plan period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% (31 March 2018: 2%) per annum.
The growth rate used is the Group’s estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the market sectors in which the Group operates.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10.3% (31 March 2018: 10.5%) has been applied, being the estimated weighted average cost of capital of
the Group.

In view of the uncertainty surrounding the UK’s decision to leave the European Union the Group has undertaken a detailed exercise
around assumptions used in the cash flows noted above and a sensitivity analysis on those cashflows. The sensitivity analysis to
changes in cashflow indicated headroom which was materially above the carrying value, so the directors are of the opinion that no
impairment of goodwill is required.

£570,000 making a net gain on disposal of £30,000.

Investment property is stated at the directors’ assessment of fair value as at 31 October 2018. This reflects, amongst other things,
rental income from current leases and assumptions about rental income from future leases, in the light of current market conditions
and consideration of market evidence for similar property if appropriate.

As the amount is not material to the Group, it is not considered necessary to provide the fair value disclosures from IFRS 13.

The Group carries out a detailed annual review of the net realisable value of land held for and under development both relating to plots
currently in development, and land and phases of sites not yet in development.

Net realisable value for land where construction of homes had commenced at the year end or is anticipated to commence within the
next 12 months was assessed by estimating selling prices and costs (including sales and marketing expenses) taking into account
current market conditions.

Land where house building had not commenced at the year end and was more likely to be sold undeveloped is assessed by reappraising the land using current selling prices and costs for the proposed development and assuming an appropriate financial return
to reflect the current housing market conditions and the prevailing financing environment.

At the year end, the net realisable value provision amounts to £400,000 (31 March 2018: £900,000). This provision will be closely
monitored for adequacy and appropriateness as regards under and over provision to reflect circumstances at future balance sheet
dates.

Government grants are recognised as deferred income and are allocated to the income statement over the useful lives of the related
assets. The effect of this treatment is to reduce the fair value of work in progress by £9,875,000 (31 March 2018: £6,687,000) and to
reduce cost of sales in the income statement by £2,011,000 (31 March 2018: £1,281,000).

subject to cross guarantees with other companies (see note 22). Interest, issue costs and the unwinding of discount on the bond are
being charged to the income statement applying an effective interest rate of 10.8%.

The senior secured notes were redeemed at par, subsequent to the year end on 11 December 2018, incurring no early repayment
charges. On the same day the Group issued a £150,000,000 term loan facility attracting interest of 6.5% plus Libor due for repayment

**Deferred consideration**

Deferred consideration arose in connection with the acquisition of MCI Developments Limited during the year ended 31 March 2017.
The consideration was discounted to present value at 31 March 2017, the current period charge to the income statement is the unwind
of that discount. The provision was settled during the period.

**Dilapidations**

The dilapidations provision covers the Group’s leased estate. A full provision up to the end of each lease was established by an
independent external valuer, with the element up to the date of the financial statements being recognised in the accounts on a prorated straight line basis.

**Other provisions**

Other provisions comprise redundancy provisions, legal fees in relation to claims and onerous lease provisions relating to the Group’s
leased estate. The onerous lease provision is calculated on a property by property basis and is calculated up to the next available
break date or end of lease, whichever is earlier.

Dilapidations and other provisions are stated at expected cost as the effects of discounting are considered to be immaterial.

**20** **Financial commitments**

At 31 October 2018, the Group has entered into non-cancellable contracts for the operational leasing of land and buildings and plant
and machinery. The leases have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. The minimum commitments for payments
under these contracts are as follows:

**Total financial commitment** **10,532** 8,447

These relate to operational leasing of land and buildings and plant, machinery and vehicles.

**21** **Retirement benefit schemes**

**Keepmoat Pension Plan**

The Group operates the Keepmoat Limited Group Pension Plan (“KPP”), with assets held in independently administered funds. Some
members of the KPP have a defined benefit promise, which is separate to the benefits payable by the KPP, being an arrangement
between Keepmoat Limited and the applicable employees. The obligation arising under this arrangement has been calculated by a
qualified independent actuary and accounted for as a long-term employee benefit. The KPP also holds assets not attributable to
individual members (“Contingency Fund”) which can be returned to the Group and therefore has been accounted for as a current
receivable within other receivables (note 14).

The major assumptions used by the actuary to calculate the liabilities of the defined benefit obligation are:

The pension cost charged to the income statement in respect of the defined contribution scheme during the period was £759,000 (31
March 2018: £1,204,000 includes discontinued operations) representing contributions payable in the year. Contributions due to the
defined contribution schemes at the period end were £98,000 (31 March 2018: £92,000).

**22** **Contingent liabilities**

The Group has entered into performance guarantees in the normal course of business which, at 31 October 2018, amounted to £8.7m
(31 March 2018: £14.1m). In the opinion of the directors, no loss will arise in respect of these guarantees.

The Group has given guarantees in respect of the bank borrowings in addition to performance and other guarantees. At 31 October
2018 the Group had bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility of £37,500,000 (31 March 2018: £37,500,000) and bank
overdrafts of £29,155,000 (31 March 2018: £1,868,000). The Group therefore had undrawn facilities totalling £8,345,000 (31 March
2018: £35,632,000). The guarantees are in the form of floating charges over the assets of certain Group companies. Following the
Group’s refinancing on 11 December 2018 the Group has a revolving credit facility of £27,500,000 and overdraft facility of £27,500,000
secured by a floating charge over the assets of certain group companies.

The Group is party to the Keystone Midco Limited Group (“Midco Group”) senior facility agreement whereby the Midco Group had a
revolving credit facility with a maximum facility of £75,000,000, following the Group’s refinancing subsequent to period end the
revolving credit facility had a maximum facility of £55,000,000. At 31 October 2018 the Midco Group was in a net cash position (31
March 2018: net cash position).

**23** **Financial instruments**

**Capital risk management**

The Group’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders by ensuring that the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to sustain its
present and forecast operations.

The Group monitors current and forecast cash liquidity and bond liquidity against available facilities to ensure that there is sufficient
capacity to meet requirements for the foreseeable future.

As part of its covenants, the Group also measures its leverage requirement as a ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net debt. The leverage
covenant requirement reduces over time. At 31 October 2018, the ratio of 2.94 for the year was within the required ratio of 4.30 (at 31
March 2018, the ratio of 2.45 for the year was within the required ratio of 4.20).

**Financial risks and management**

The Group’s principal financial instruments comprised senior secured notes, bank loans, subordinated shareholder loan notes, and
cash. The Group refinanced it’s debt post year end, for more details see note 27. The main purpose of these financial instruments and
the new financial instruments following the Group’s refinancing post year end is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group
has other financial instruments including trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations.

No trading in financial instruments has been undertaken.

The Group has exposure to a variety of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. The Board reviews and agrees policies for
managing risk as well as specific policies and guidelines.

The key financial risks resulting from the Group’s use of financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.

**a)** **Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meets its contractual obligations mainly arising on the Group’s
trade receivables and amounts due from construction contract customers.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited for open market housebuilding activities as the Group typically receives cash at the point
of legal completion of its sales.

The credit risk on registered provider sales depends on the individual characteristics of the counterparty many of whom are in the
public sector or are funded by the public sector (e.g. housing associations). The Board consider that the credit rating of these
customers is good and the credit risk on outstanding balances to be low.

The Group does not have any concentration of risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract receivables or trade
receivable balances, with receivables spread across a wide range of customers.

The ageing of trade receivables (see note 14) is as follows:

**31 October 2018** 31 March 2018

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018

**23  Financial instruments (continued)**

Following the adoption of IFRS 9 the Group has applied an effective credit loss model to its recoverability of its receivables, but most
of which are from housing associations which are government funded. Given the nature of the Group’s receivables and lack of
significant exposure to expected credit loss, the impact of the effective credit loss model has been minimal.

Included within the Group’s trade receivable balance are receivables with a carrying amount of £3.7m (31 March 2018: £7.2m) which
are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and
the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.

**b)** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. An ageing profile of
the Group’s loans and borrowings is presented in note 17.

The Group’s objective is to manage liquidity by ensuring that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they become
due. This will be assessed under normal and stress conditions, without incurring losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

Following the refinancing of the senior secured notes and the refinancing of the revolving credit facility the Group has released a
further £22m of liquidity. See note 23 for more details on the Group’s refinancing subsequent to year end.

The Group has rigorous cash management processes. Cash balances are reported daily with detailed analysis of variances to short
term cash forecasts. Short term cash forecasts are updated monthly and are for a period of 26 weeks with the first 8 weeks on a daily
basis and the remaining 18 weeks on a weekly basis. These complement a minimum of four long term quarterly cash forecasts each
year which are compared to the annual cash flow budget and to previous quarterly forecasts. These facilitate management’s
assessments of the Group’s expected cash performance and to compare to the facilities available and the Group’s covenants.

Key risks to liquidity and cash balances are a decrease in the value of open market sales, a downturn in the UK housing market,
deterioration in credit terms obtainable in the market from suppliers and subcontractors, a downturn in the profitability of work, delayed
receipt of cash from customers and a general decline in the ability of local authorities to fund urban regeneration projects.

In order to mitigate this risk the Group continually monitors open market house sales volumes and prices; continuous monitoring of
working capital levels and contract profitability and the review of client and supplier credit references and credit terms with clients and
suppliers to ensure they continue to be appropriate.

The Group does not have any derivative financial liabilities.

**c)** **Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates, house prices and foreign exchange rates will affect the
Group income or the value of the Group’s financial instruments.

_Interest rate risk_

The Group’s exposure to changes in market interest rates is significantly mitigated as its long term borrowings comprise exclusively
fixed interest rate instruments. The committed bank facilities are at floating interest rates at a margin over the London Interbank
Borrowing Rate (LIBOR) and management continually keeps this exposure under review. Following the refinancing post year end the
Group now holds an additional £150m of floating rate debt, so its exposure to interest risk has increased.

At 31 October 2018, 59% (31 March 2018: 70%) of the Group’s borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest.

_Housing market risk_

The Group is affected by price fluctuations of the UK housing market. The market is impacted by consumer demand and employment
levels and is dependent on the availability of mortgage finance. Furthermore, Government incentives, such as the “Help to Buy”
scheme, have helped to stimulate consumer demand. Whilst these risks are beyond the Group’s ultimate control, risk is spread across
differing business activities undertaken by the Group and the geographical regions in which it operates.

_Currency risk_

The Group operates entirely in the United Kingdom and all of the Group’s revenue is generated in the United Kingdom and is
denominated in pounds sterling. Consequently the Group has very limited exposure to currency risk

**Fair values of financial instruments**

_Trade and other receivables_

The fair value of trade and other receivables, excluding contract assets, is estimated as the present value of future cash flows,
discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material. The carrying amount of trade and other
receivables is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018

**23    Financial instruments (continued)**

_Trade and other payables_

The fair value of trade and other payables, excluding contract liabilities, is estimated as the present value of future cash flows,
discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material. The carrying amount of trade and other
payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated at its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand.

_Loans and borrowings_

Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest
at the balance sheet date.

**382,816** **381,170** 328,641 331,283

Prepayments and contract assets are excluded from the trade and other receivables balances. Accruals, contract liabilities, non-cash
land commitments and statutory liabilities are excluded from trade and other payables as these are not financial instruments.

_Borrowing facilities_

At 31 October 2018, the Group had committed borrowing facilities totalling £75,000,000 (31 March 2018: £75,000,000) representing
revolving credit facilities and overdraft, which following an extension of the facility, are due for renewal on 31 August 2019. At 31
October 2018 the Group had bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility of £37,500,000 (31 March 2018: £37,500,000) and
bank overdrafts of £29,155,000 (31 March 2018: £1,868,000). The Group therefore had undrawn facilities totalling £8,345,000 (31
March 2018: £35,632,000). Revolving credit facilities bear interest at 3.25% over LIBOR whilst cash overdrafts are 3.75% over Bank
of England base rate. Performance bonds attract interest at a flat rate of 1.875%.

**26 Adoption of new standards**

**IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’**

The Group has adopted IFRS 15 from 1 April 2018. The Group has applied IFRS15 in accordance with the fully retrospective
transitional approach without using the practical expedients for completed contracts in IFRS15.C5(a), and (b), or for modified contracts
in IFRS 15.C5(c), but using the expedient in IFRS 15.C5(d) allowing both non-disclosure of the amount of the transaction price
allocated to the remaining performance obligations, and an explanation of when it expects to recognise that amount as revenue for all
reporting periods presented before the date of initial application, ie 1 April 2017.

Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This
can lead to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. Primarily, for
those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from registered providers of housing, revenue will be recognised based
on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. The majority of the Group’s revenue and profit, including revenue from open
market sales, will continue to be recognised on legal completion.

61


-----

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018

**26   Adoption of new standards (continued)**

The standard also sets out the requirements for recognition of non-cash consideration as revenue. Previously, where the Group
entered into arrangements to provide housing to registered providers at below open market value in exchange for discounted land
from partners, the associated housing unit revenue is recorded at open market value. IFRS 15 does not permit this, as the exchange
transaction (land discount from partner) is not received directly from the customer (registered provider) and so does not meet the
criteria of non-cash consideration. This will reduce reported revenue. Accordingly, the revenue recognised in respect of these housing
units will be equal to the cash consideration received from registered providers, with no open market value adjustment. There are a
limited number of developments where the eventual buyer of the affordable units is the same entity as the land vendor. In these
instances the discount received represents non-cash consideration, which continues to be recognised as revenue.

The table below shows the impact of adoption of IFRS 15 on the previously reported year ended 31 March 2018 income statement
and balance sheet.

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the 7 month period ended 31 October 2018

**26    Adoption of new standards (continued)**

[1] The standard sets out the requirements for recognition of non-cash consideration as revenue. Previously, where the Group
entered into arrangements to provide housing to registered providers at below open market value in exchange for discounted land
from partners, the associated housing unit revenue was recorded at open market value. IFRS 15 does not permit this, as the
exchange transaction (land discount from partner) is not received directly from the customer (registered provider) and so does not
meet the criteria of non-cash consideration, except in the case when the land vendor and buyer of affordable units are the same.
Accordingly, the revenue recognised in respect of these housing units will be equal to the cash consideration received from
registered providers, with no open market value adjustment.

[2] Under IFRS 15, revenue recognised prior to the date on which it is invoiced to the customer is recognised as a contract asset.
This balance was previously recognised within trade receivables and has so been reclassified. There was no impact on the
income statement as a result of these reclassifications.

[3] For registered provider sales there is a timing difference between payment for the houses and when control passes to the
customer. A contract liability has been recognised for this amount, that was previously recognised within accruals and deferred
income. There was no impact on the income statement as a result of these reclassifications.

[4] Prior to the Group adopting IFRS 15 revenue from registered providers was recognised on legal completion. Under IFRS 15,
revenue is recognised based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This leads to
differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. Primarily, for those
sites in respect of which stage payments are received from registered providers of housing, revenue will be recognised based on
stage of completion rather than on legal completion. The impact would be to recognise revenue earlier and the impact is shown
above. The balance sheet impact of this is to decrease contract liabilities and increase contract assets. At the same time this
adjustment reduces the value of inventories as cost of sales increases as revenue is recognised earlier.

[5] Prior to the introduction of IFRS 15 a land commitment creditor was recognised for the fair value of housing due to registered
providers. Going forward, following the change discussed in [1] above, the Group will only recognise a development land payable
balance when the land vendor and buyer of affordable units are the same. The effect will be to reduce development land payables
and land held for and under development by the same amount.

**IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’**

IFRS 9 came into effect on 1 January 2018 replacing IAS39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement and requires
changes to the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments from that under IAS 39. On review the majority of the
Group’s financial assets and liabilities will continue to be accounted for on an identical basis under IFRS 9 as they were under IAS 39.

**Impairment of financial assets**

IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model, rather than an incurred credit loss model to be applied. This requires the assessment
of the expected credit loss on each class of financial asset at each reporting date. This assessment should take into consideration any
changes in credit risk since the initial recognition of the financial asset.

At 1 April 2018 the directors have reviewed and assessed the existing financial assets and amounts due from customers to determine
the credit risk of each item and concluded that there is no financial impact on the Group. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited
for open market housebuilding activities as the Group typically receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.

The credit risk relating to registered provider sales depends on the individual characteristics of the contract counterparty many of
whom are in the public sector or are funded by the public sector (e.g. housing associations). The Board consider that the credit rating
of these customers is good and the credit risk on outstanding balances to be low.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited - Company

# Report on the audit of the company financial statements

**Opinion**

In our opinion, Keystone Midco Limited’s company financial statements (the “financial statements”):

     - give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 October 2018;

     - have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and
applicable law); and

     - have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Financial Statements (the “Annual
Report”), which comprise: the company balance sheet as at 31 October 2018; the company statement of changes in
equity for the 7 month period then ended; the principal company accounting policies; and the notes to the financial
statements.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

_Independence_

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

**Our audit approach**

_Overview_

                 - Overall materiality: £820,000 (12 month period ended 31 Mar 2018:
£1,260,000), based on 1% of total assets.

                 - All material balances within the Company's financial statements have been
subject to a full scope audit

                 - Carrying value of investments and intercompany receivables.

_The scope of our audit_

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect
of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently
uncertain.

As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating
whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited - Company

_Key audit matters_

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit
of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on:
the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

**_Key audit matter_** **_How our audit addressed the key audit matter_**


_Carrying value of investments and intercompany_
_receivables_

We focused upon this area because the underlying value in
the Company is represented by balances due from the
wider group and the investment held by the Company in
its subsidiaries.

The key judgement is the underlying cash generation and
profitability of the wider group which can be affected by
market conditions and unexpected events.

_How we tailored the audit scope_


We assessed the adequacy of controls over the forecasting
of the group and underlying controls over site valuations,
including costs to complete, site budget approvals, and the
authorisation and recording of costs, including testing of
controls over the allocation of costs to the correct sites.

We assessed the accuracy of management’s forecasting of
site development profit against actual profits recorded.

We performed sensitivity analysis over the forecasts of the
group, specifically a decline in EBITDA (focusing on a
downturn in revenue and increase in build costs) and
increase in discount rate. We noted no concerns with the
carrying value.


We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the
financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the company, the accounting processes and
controls, and the industry in which it operates.

The Company is managed by the Keystone JVco Limited group's head office function. All balances within the
Company's financial statements have been subject to a full scope audit.

_Materiality_

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and
in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

**_Overall materiality_** £820,000 (12 month period ended 31 Mar 2018: £1,260,000).

**_How we determined it_** 1% of total assets.


**_Rationale for benchmark_**
**_applied_**


The key objective of the company is to hold investments in the various group
companies. As a result, we believe total assets is the primary measure used by the
shareholders in assessing the performance of the parent company and is therefore
the appropriate benchmark to use in setting materiality.


We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above
£50,000 (12 month period ended 31 Mar 2018: £63,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view,
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when:

     - the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is
not appropriate; or

     - the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may
cast significant doubt about the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

68


-----

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited - Company

We have nothing to report in respect of the above matters.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern. For example, the terms on which the United Kingdom may withdraw
from the European Union, which is currently due to occur on 29 March 2019, are not clear, and it is difficult to evaluate
all of the potential implications on the company’s trade, customers, suppliers and the wider economy.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and
our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material
inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material
misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report
that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us
also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

_Strategic Report and Directors’ Report_

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report
and Directors’ Report for the period ended 31 October 2018 is consistent with the financial statements and has been
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we
did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements_

As explained more fully in the Statement of the Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the financial statements set out
on page 16, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the
applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

_Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

_Use of this report_

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions,
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose
hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

### Principal company accounting policies for the year ended 31 October 2018

**Basis of preparation**

The Company financial statements of Keystone Midco Limited have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (“FRS 101”) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical
cost convention except investment property which have been measured at fair value.

The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. All financial information is rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except
where otherwise indicated. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements have been
consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.

FRS 101 allows the income statement and balance sheet to be presented in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS)
1 - Presentation of Financial Statements.

A summary of the disclosure exemptions adopted for the year ended 31 October 2018 is presented below. Equivalent disclosures for
financial instruments are included in the Keepmoat Midco Limited Group consolidated financial statements allowing the exemptions to
be applied.

**Area** **Disclosure exemption**

Cash flow statements Exemption from preparing a cash flow statement. (IAS 7)

Financial instrument Exemption from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments) and related IFRS
disclosures 13 disclosures.

Exemption from the disclosures in respect of management’s objectives, policies and processes for
managing capital (IAS1.134 to 136).

Comparative information Exemption from comparative disclosure for movements on share capital, property, plant and
equipment, intangibles and investment property.

Related party disclosures Exemption for related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group,
provided that any subsidiary which is party to a transaction is wholly owned by such a member.

Exemption from disclosure of key management personnel compensation.

Presentation of Financial Exemption from statement of compliance with IFRS, cash flow information and capital
Statements management policy.

The Company has consistently and uniformly applied the accounting policies of the Group set out on pages 28 to 35 insofar as they
are applicable to the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and subject to the disclosure exemptions
above.

**Investments**

Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are recorded in the Company’s balance sheet at cost less any impairment.
The directors review the investments for impairment when there are indicators of possible impairment.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Company’s management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions
are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.

**Impairment of investments and inter-company receivables**

Determining whether investments and inter-company receivables are impaired requires an estimate of the future discounted cash
flows of each investment or receivable. Discounted cash flows and assumptions (including discount rates, timing of cash flows and
growth prospects) are inherently subjective and largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Company.

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Executive Officer’s Review

**OVERVIEW**

The last 12 months have been a transformational period for Keepmoat Homes. In the year to 31 March 2018 we delivered 3,717 much
needed high quality new homes, 793 more than the year before, and we saw an increase in our revenues of 31.3% to £555.6m.

Our new financial year has started well. We are planning to build over 4,000 homes this year and are looking to continue to build on
that growth with our partners in the years to come.

The disposal of Keepmoat’s Regeneration division to energy and services group ENGIE, completed successfully on 30 April 2017.
Keepmoat Homes is now focused entirely on delivering the new homes the UK needs and remaining the UK’s leading partnership
homebuilder.

Keepmoat is the UK’s largest and only dedicated partnership homebuilder and we are committed to maintaining that position and
increasing the number of homes we deliver. We have a presence in all the top 10 markets outside London. Our partners include
Homes England with whom we have delivered 11,300 new homes under DPP1, DPP2 and other initiatives with a gross development
value of £1.3bn. We also work in strong and enduring partnerships with local authorities and registered providers, with many of those
relationships being 5 to 10 years, or in some cases over 20 years, in duration. These relationships are extremely important to us and
through our business model we create both financial and socio-economic benefits for our partners, not least through the delivery and
acceleration of much needed new homes across the UK.

Keepmoat has been the largest partner of Homes England (previously the Homes and Communities Agency) as a member of
successive Development Partner Panels. Since 2009, Keepmoat has accessed over £177m in funding initiatives to accelerate output
delivery. We have used the Home Building Fund to accelerate the delivery of 2,200 homes and Help to Buy to support the ambitions of
70% of our homebuyers.

Keepmoat’s customer base is at the core of the UK housing need, with Keepmoat Homes continuing to be the leading homebuilder of
quality homes for first time buyers, at prices people can afford.

Last year we built 2,555 homes for open market sale, with 69% being built for the very important first time buyer market and with 51%
of our buyers under the age of 35.

The market for new affordable homes remains strong in all of our markets, supported by the availability of suitable mortgage products
that make it more affordable to buy than rent. It is also helped by the ongoing support for Help to Buy and we are expecting this to be
continued, albeit we expect to see some reforms. Government commitment to new housing also remains strong and has significant
cross party support.

Keepmoat Homes is committed to a multi-tenure strategy with registered providers and the private rented sector (PRS).

We sold 1,162 homes to registered providers and the build-to-rent market (or PRS) in the last financial year (31% of our total homes
built) and this underpins our multi-tenure strategy. This includes 20 homes delivered for our partner Sigma and its PRS Real Estate
Investment Trust (The PRS REIT plc), and we have a number of other sites under active consideration. These markets are important
to us as our partners increasingly want to see multi-tenure development. In addition, as part of a balanced blend, they can help drive
our financial performance by delivering additional volume and improving our return on capital which is already one of the highest
amongst our peers.

**Expertise in brownfield development**
We are the UK’s leading brownfield homebuilder. We are not distracted from brownfield development by more readily available
greenfield sites. Our experience gives us confidence in valuing brownfield sites and means that we attach lower levels of
contingencies, improving site viability.

Our willingness to work on brownfield sites is clear from our track record: over 80% of our current developments are on brownfield
land.

We are pleased to see an increasingly sophisticated approach to brownfield land from the public sector - in particular, a willingness to
package together sites so that the profitable cross subsidise the otherwise unviable. Local authorities in Leeds, Sheffield, Rotherham
and Herefordshire provide model approaches for others to follow.

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Executive Officer’s Review

**Investment in Modern Methods of Construction**
The industry is increasingly looking at modern methods of construction (MMC), and in this respect Keepmoat Homes is delighted to
partner with modular homes specialist ilke Homes.

With the help of ilke, we delivered the first two homes using modern methods of construction, at our Carr Lodge development in
Doncaster and we have a healthy pipeline being built in partnership with ilke Homes to follow. We see MMC adding capacity in the
market and being particularly well suited for high volume developments.

We have invested substantially in ilke Homes and worked with their team to create a product tailored to the aspirations of first time
buyers and also to the requirements of our public sector and housing association partners.

We welcome the Government’s support for modular construction to drive the delivery of additional homes, over and above what the
industry can currently build. It sees modular construction as a means of applying manufacturing’s quality-control systems to
housebuilding, modernising the skills of the construction workforce and generating economic growth through a native high-tech
industry.

**Whole-Government commitment to housing supply**
The need to increase housing supply is no longer only recognised at ministry level. It is a whole-government policy, actively supported
by the Prime Minister and Chancellor, to raise housing supply to its highest levels since the 1970s, targeting 300,000 new homes a
year by the mid-2020s. There is also growing convergence in terms of housing policy across all parties and we welcome that.

In this financial year, we have seen the responsible department renamed as the Ministry of Housing, Community and Local
Government to reflect the priority given to supply. We have seen the Government’s agency rebranded as Homes England and also
refocused on supply. And we have seen the Letwin Review set up to challenge the industry to build out its planning consents.

The Government continues to find ways to stimulate supply, including:

   - Providing a “down payment” of £44bn of financial support over the next 5 years

   - Confirmation of a further £10bn for Help to Buy supporting a further 135,000 new homes

   - £4.1bn for its Housing Infrastructure Fund

   - £1.1bn for a Land Assembly Fund, enabling Homes England to work alongside housebuilders

   - Planning reforms to accelerate delivery, encourage use of brownfield land and fast-track planning of sites with high
proportions of first time or affordable homes.

**Support for first-time buyers**
The Government demonstrated its commitment to helping first time buyers by eliminating stamp duty for their purchases of homes up
to £300,000 and by committing a further £10bn for Help to Buy.

We continue to press for Help to Buy to be funded beyond 2021, either in its current form or reformed to support first time buyers and
those with lower incomes and to make available funding go further. It is popular with buyers, and its valuable side effects are in
stimulating house building and, in doing so, providing subsidy for affordable tenures.

The alignment of Keepmoat Homes with the ambitions of Government and our public sector partners means we are optimistic about
our future at the heart of the UK housing market.

Finally, but by no means least, I would like to thank everyone at Keepmoat who has contributed to our success and to thank them for
all of their hard work. We could not deliver the homes the UK needs without them.

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Operating Officer’s Review

From the first quarter of 2018, Keepmoat Homes has operated as one business, initially with nine regional teams organised into three
divisions: Scotland and North West; North East and Yorkshire; Midlands and South. The number of regional teams and their
boundaries is intended to remain flexible, enabling all to remain at an optimum size for effective management.

A divisional chairman is responsible for each of the three divisions, supported by a divisional finance director. Each of the regional
teams has its own management board, applying the Group’s policies and systems to local markets and circumstances.

**Localised expertise for complex markets**
With elected mayors and their advisers shaping distinctive housing policies in the new combined authorities, our markets are more
complex than ever. Our teams need to understand the overlapping requirements of local authorities, city regions and national
government, at the same time as staying in touch with the ambitions of our local authority and housing association partners and our
customers.

We are supporting them by putting expertise and decision making authority as close as possible to the market place. Our new
Scotland region is firmly established and delivered more than 100 plots in the year. One of our largest regions, Yorkshire, has been
divided in two to form more agile and connected bases for our teams.

**A flexible multi-tenure product**
Our core market is first time buyers and first time movers, but we recognise that our partners are looking to meet a broad range of
housing needs.

Around 31% of our sales are to registered providers or to the new breed of investors in private rented sector homes, built and
designed specifically for that market.

The 3,717 plots we sold in the past year were for private sale (with and without Help to Buy), affordable or market rent and shared
ownership.

**Land**
The strength, depth and sustainable nature of our partnerships with over 200 local authorities, housing associations and other
organisations, is demonstrated by the pipeline of land available to us for development.

At 31 March 2018, the number of plots within our land pipeline, including sites where we have been appointed preferred developer,
increased by 13% to 32,331 representing 8.7 years of work ahead based on current build rates (FY17: 28,544 plots representing 7.7
years).

**Procurement**
Keepmoat appointed a dedicated Supply Chain Director in 2017. As we grow in each of our regions, our supply chain must grow with
us.

Procurement is one of the core functions now represented in each of our regions, where our buyers can respond with agility to local
growth strategies and build effective relationships with local supply chains. These local relationships are supported by our business
wide Strategic Framework Agreements which leverage our nationwide spend. Face-to-face engagement is actively encouraged.

We foster strategic relationships with our supply chain that help to deliver our business goals, and support sustainable business
growth.

Procurement is critical in managing sustainable supply chain relationships and assuring core standards and continuous improvement
in quality, safety, service, innovation and cost competitiveness. We actively manage a high-quality supply base that shares our values
and is fully aligned to supporting our growing business.

Throughout the year we have been focused on:

   - **Capacity: securing the subcontractor and materials capacity to meet the Group’s five-year business plan**

   - **Cost: mitigating significant inflation in a tight market and benefitting the Group’s bottom line**

   - **Collaboration: establishing a collaborative partnership model to drive value engineering, improve cost planning and reduce**
delays on site

   - **Control: improving control through greater visibility of costs and better reporting, both regionally and nationally**

### Strategic Report 

 Chief Operating Officer’s Review

**Advanced construction techniques**
Supporting many of our procurement objectives, and vital to improving quality across the business is our move to digital construction
and other advanced construction techniques.

A fourth industrial revolution is putting artificial intelligence, robotics, virtual reality and a host of new design, offsite manufacture and
on site assembly techniques at the service of the construction industry. The speed of change is unprecedented and Keepmoat Homes
is open to challenging traditions to find solutions that complement our current ways of working, but meet demands for speed,
efficiency, productivity, certainty and quality.

We have digitised our 2018 range of house types and are starting to see benefits for our customers, in the ease and detail with which
we can show them their end home, in the quality of that home, and in the improved internal efficiencies being realised at all stages of
design, procurement, construction and after-sales care.

**People**
Our people are at the heart of our business and we value them tremendously. We are proud of our skilled and dedicated colleagues,
who work hard to help make our business a success. We recognise that we need to continually invest in our people and ensure that
we attract, inspire and retain like-minded individuals to bolster our team and help us to deliver excellent service for our customers.

**Apprentices and trainees**
We continue to develop our skilled teams through high levels of trainees, apprentices and graduates who consistently make up around
nine per cent of our workforce. We count well over 100 apprentices as part of the team, including bricklayers, quantity surveyors and
administrators.

Since 2017 we have been sourcing many of our trainees and apprentices through the Bridge into Construction programme. This oneyear foundation course is being offered by selected further education colleges across the UK through a partnership between
construction industry body Build UK and further education network Collab Group. One of the participating institutions, Sheffield
College, is becoming a key training partner for us.

**Talent development at all levels**
We are looking at better ways of developing talent throughout the full length of a career with Keepmoat Homes:

   - Talent mapping is helping us to understand what talent we have, where it is in the business and what we need to do to
develop it. It will be vital in succession planning across many key roles.

   - Our bespoke Effective Keepmoat Manager programme is currently benefitting over 50 of our colleagues as they hone their
leadership skills.

   - We have signed up to the Home Building Skills Pledge of the Home Builders Federation and are active members of their
Home Building Skills Partnership.

**Keepmoat academies**
Keepmoat’s commercial team is pioneering an ‘academy’ approach to learning and development.

After an initial focus on standardising working practices across the 100-strong commercial team, its scope is broadening into an endto-end learning and development experience for everyone in the team. The subject matter ranges from cost control standards to softer
skills, such as change management and motivation.

The commercial academy harnesses the expertise of directors within the Group’s commercial team, supported by the development
team and external trainers. Learning might be face-to-face or using e-learning technology. It is a means of imparting experience and
injecting forward thinking.

**Diversity**
The homebuilding industry suffers from gender imbalance, particularly at senior levels. Keepmoat Homes is committed to attracting the
right, skilled people into the organisation at all levels, regardless of gender.

We support initiatives to attract more women into the industry and see the benefits that diversity brings to the organisation. We are
working hard to break down the perceptions that have historically made the industry less attractive to women.

**Health and safety**
Keepmoat Homes is a standalone housebuilder, managing construction on site as principal contractor.

Our success in refining our approach to health and safety in that role throughout the 2017/18 financial year earned us a RoSPA Gold
Award for 2017. That accolade recognises a very high level of performance, demonstrating well-developed occupational health and
safety management systems and culture, outstanding control of risk and very low levels of error, harm and loss.

RoSPA’s recognition does not mean the job is done. We refocused our Safety, Health, Environment and Quality (SHEQ) strategy at
the end of 2017 on three core areas:

   - Keeping people safe and healthy every day

   - Protecting and enhancing the environment

   - Being assured, informed and focussed on quality

Early progress has been made in these areas:

   - Active and visible leadership is being provided from the top of the Group. Our senior managers not only set an example of
appropriate behaviour on site, but ensure that the Group’s expectations set a framework within which a safe culture can
become embedded.

   - Clear and robust performance standards have been developed for five high-risk activities. We are enforcing safe working
practices around plant and work at height. Our people are conscious of additional risks when assembling timber frame
structures. And we have been successful in reducing incidents of underground services being struck.

   - A new approach to inductions is ensuring that everyone on site is fully engaged in our health and safety programme. An
online training programme and test establish 100% understanding before new employees or contractors step onto site.

   - An integrated approach to risk management is being taken that includes all stakeholders throughout all phases of a contract.
We seek to design out risk at an early stage and ensure that sound technical decisions are not lost later in the process.

   - We have ensured that our contractors have Risk Assessment and Method Statements in place, but our focus is now turning
to outcomes. We want to see that those statements have been adequately communicated, comprehended and complied
with.

Whilst our safety performance is significantly better than our peers within the HBF, the rate of improvement has stabilised and we are
committed to driving continual improvement across all aspects of health and safety.

As the 2018/19 financial year starts, we are rolling out new systems and standards. Onsite inspections will use contemporary software
to record richer data, giving us improved management information and better understanding of incident data and trends. Our ‘fit for
work’ programme will set a new occupational health framework comprising information and health surveillance advice for both
employees and contractors before, during and after their time on site.

Having established a SHEQ Leadership and Review Process as part of our SHEQ governance arrangements, it is our intent to review
performance throughout all levels of the organisation on a regular basis, always with the aim to improve our performance.

### Strategic Report 

 Our vision, mission and values

Our vision, mission and values shape our strategy and the way we work, and mean we are a different type of housebuilder. Our
corporate strengths include our local knowledge, long term customer relationships, national and local presence, supply chain and our
ability to enhance local economies by employing local firms and creating local jobs.

**Keepmoat Vision: Building Communities, Transforming lives.**
This means that we think and act beyond bricks and mortar. As well as creating better places for people to live, we know that our
success depends on us playing our part in building the strong communities our partners and customers want.

We work with our partners to regenerate places to improve economic and social outcomes for local citizens while providing housing
choice in these areas. We focus on improving the communities we work in and the people we serve, creating significant local
economic benefits through our supply chain and local employment. Nine per cent of our workforce are trainees, apprentices and
graduates.

**Keepmoat Mission: We are committed to building long-term partnerships to deliver high-quality community regeneration**

**solutions.**
Our Mission explains how we are very different from a traditional housebuilder. It’s in what we do, and how we do it. We create long
term partnerships with large organisations who have unused land or properties. Together we build attractive, affordable and high
quality homes and communities that people want.

We bring together all facets of housing development, including design, planning and community engagement skills, to help partners
achieve their ambitions. We nurture an extensive supply chain of small and medium sized companies that support us around the
country and make that supply chain available to our public and private sector partners.

**Keepmoat Values: Straightforward, Passionate, Collaborative and Creative.**
Our Values support the vision, shape the culture and reflect how we work and behave.

   - Straightforward: We get the job done in the most efficient way. We are friendly, open and honest. In other words, the
people you could trust on any project, large or small.

   - Passionate: We care about what we do. We put pride and energy into delivering results. We give the best, so more people
can enjoy living in safe, happy communities and homes.

   - Collaborative: We work together in partnership to deliver the very best customer experience. By sharing our expertise, we
can build the very best.

   - Creative: We are proactive, flexible and resourceful. We listen, learn and deliver solutions.

**Essentials**
Our Essentials are the five basic building blocks of our business.

   - Safety: The safety of people, partners and communities is at the heart of everything we do.

   - Quality: We work to exceed our stakeholders’ expectations of our service, product and delivery.

   - Customer: We focus on delighting our customer.

   - People: Our people are the heart of our business, providing a service we are proud of.

   - Sustainability: We protect the environment, act ethically and leave a positive legacy.

### Strategic Report

 Making the most of our strengths

The Group’s existing strengths support our growth ambitions:

**National scale, local understanding. Keepmoat has successfully grown into a large national business with deep local roots and we**
intend to maintain that national and local approach.

**Develop our comprehensive offer. We have a broad set of skills ranging from developing partnerships with landowners,**
establishing supply chains, building houses and flats and supporting large-scale, housing-led regeneration.

**Organic growth. In the next five years we intend to increase the number of new houses we build for sale or rent by 50% – a major**
contribution to meeting the country’s housing needs. We want to build more and faster.

**Market and sector expansion. The need for more housing means we can bring our distinct approach to new markets:**

   - **Grow our core: Our core markets will remain first time buyer homes, and we will continue to work in partnership with local**
authorities and housing associations. We will continue to build our presence in this market.

   - **Enter new geographies: We continue to expand our offer into Scotland, the South West and South of England, where we**
have historically had little presence.

   - **Enter new sectors: We will enter new markets, so more housing opportunities will be created. We are expanding our**
home offer by introducing offsite manufacturing in to our developments, and are creating partnerships with financial
organisations combined with our skills and capabilities to create new homes in the private rental sector.

**Leveraging our scale. We have grown mostly by financing and delivering small and medium sized housing programmes, whether**
homes for sale or new build for rent. Now, our national scale and financial strength together with the breadth of our experience, and
depth of our skills and capabilities, mean we can compete to deliver a greater number of larger programmes and partnerships.

**Shape more partnerships. At the heart of our growth will be deeper and broader partnerships with existing and new partners. That**
requires us to understand partners’ challenges and objectives, and develop ways to help them meet their goals whether economic growth; social - tackling deprivation, improving health; environmental - reducing carbon consumption; financial - reducing operating
costs; operational - improving customer service; or strategic - developing their housing portfolios.

**Efficiency and effectiveness. As we grow bigger, we risk becoming less agile. We want the best of both worlds - being local and**
agile, almost like a small business can be. But we also want the benefits of being a large business such as professional rigour,
quality, efficiency and effectiveness in winning and delivering work. That means we share what works well, and avoid duplication and
unnecessary spend, as our customers expect.

**Building our brand. To build more homes we will need more people to choose to work for us as colleagues or with us as suppliers**
and partners. That means we need to be better understood. Our audiences need to know what we do, how we do it and why we are
both different, and better, than the competition. We need to further build our reputation and ensure that we understand our audiences’
concerns.

### Strategic Report – Principal risks and uncertainties

Our approach to risk management is evolving as the business continues to grow and in response to some of the challenges we have
faced this year, as well as the appointment of an in-house Head of Internal Audit, which will further help embed best practice risk
management within the business and adds further strength to our risk and internal controls framework.

In considering our principal risks and arriving at the table below, our risk management processes have considered all parts of our
business from setting of strategy to business operations and the external environment to which we are exposed. The risks below are

### Strategic Report 

 Financial review

**Overview**

Continuing to build on performance in previous years, Keepmoat Homes’ revenue from continuing operations for the year grew
significantly to £555.6m (FY17: £423.2m), an increase of 31.3%. The number of home sales increased 27.1% to 3,717 (FY17: 2,924),
with average selling price increasing to £149k (FY17: £145k). This and future growth continues to be supported by our regional
expansion programme, including into relatively new regions such as Scotland, and by our multi-tenure strategy via registered
providers, the private rented sector, and open market sales.

In order to provide clearer visibility of the underlying performance of the Group, the Board elect to measure profits on an adjusted
basis alongside other key KPIs as follows:

1. Contribution is gross profit adjusted for exceptional items and acquisition fair value adjustments (a reconciliation of gross profit to contribution is
provided in note 3).

2. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and is calculated before exceptional items, acquisition fair value
adjustments and shareholder management fees (a reconciliation of operating profit to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in note 3).

3. Adjusted EBIT is earnings before interest, tax and amortisation and is calculated before exceptional items, acquisition fair value adjustments and

Contribution increased by 23.4% to £88.1m (FY17: £71.4m) given increased volume, with adjusted EBIT increasing by 21.6% to
£41.7m (FY17: £34.2m). Operating profit from continuing operations for the year was £15.5m (FY17: £25.0m); a decrease of 38.2%,
but reflecting exceptional items, see below and note 4 for further details.

Operating cash flows from continuing activities were £2.5m lower in the year, delivering an outflow of £3.8m (FY17: outflow of £1.3m).
This was principally driven by continued investment in land and build work in progress in order to support further growth into the future
and the one off exceptional items borne in FY18.

These results are underpinned by a set of well embedded principles in Keepmoat’s corporate ethos including prudent management,
risk assessment, customer satisfaction, quality of products and services, innovation and continuous improvement.

**Disposal of Regeneration Division**

On 30 April 2017, the Group successfully disposed of Keepmoat Regeneration Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (the Regeneration
division) to ENGIE Services Holding UK Limited. The final sale proceeds of £313.1m exceeded the carrying amount of the related net
assets at the completion date and, accordingly, £131.5m has been recorded as a gain on disposal of discontinued operations in the
Group financial statements. Following this disposal, on 12 May 2017 the Group made a cash return to shareholders of £145m in
aggregate, followed by the redemption of £163m of the Group’s bond debt on 15 June 2017, strengthening the Group’s balance sheet
and reducing net debt.

### Strategic Report 

 Financial review

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items in the year amounted to a net charge of £25.3m (FY17: £5.2m). This included £13.2m of losses recognised on a
number of sites within the West Midlands region where significant trading issues, including significant cost over-runs that were not
adequately managed, resulted in site losses which by size of loss and nature warranted separate presentation as exceptional items.
Losses on sites were fully provided against in the year ended March 2018, with trading on all such sites completed no later than the
end of the first quarter of the following financial year. To ensure profitable on-going trading, following detailed review, the decision was
taken to close the West Midlands regional office, with the site portfolio rationalised and the management of on-going profitable sites
successfully transferred to other regional offices, fully sustaining the presence of the Group within the Midlands region as a whole. In
addition, exceptional restructuring costs of £4.2m in aggregate were incurred in the year, relating both to the closure of the West
Midlands regional office and to wider Group restructuring following the disposal of the Regeneration division. Other exceptional costs
included a £7.7m early repayment penalty on redemption of the Group’s bond debt.

**Financing costs**

External financing costs in the year were £35.0m (FY17: £32.9m). This included early repayment charges of £7.7m on redemption of
£163.0m of the Group’s senior secured notes, as cited above leading to a cash outflow of £30.0m (FY17: £27.4m). The annual charge
includes non-cash amounts of £6.2m (FY17: £2.2m) in respect of amortisation of arrangement fees, of which £4.7m was written off on
partial redemption of the bond and a £3.0m (FY17: £2.5m) unwind of discount on deferred land payments.

**Taxation**

The current year tax credit relating to continuing operations of £3.8m (FY17: £5.3m charge) is made up of a current tax credit of £0.7m
and a deferred tax credit of £3.1m. Since the disposal of the Regeneration business the Group no longer charges for group relief, and
as such the tax credit is broadly in line with the standard rate of corporation tax.

**Net debt and leverage**

Net debt at the end of FY18 was £102.4m (FY17: £224.8m), the Group having redeemed £163.0m of its senior secured loan notes
during the year. This corresponds to a leverage of 2.4x (FY17: 3.2x) when applied to the Group (including the Regeneration business
in FY17) based on adjusted EBITDA of £43.1m (FY17: £70.0m).

**Working capital**

The amount of working capital required to service the Group’s operations is closely monitored and controlled, and forms a key part of
the management information reviewed on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Current assets mainly comprise trade receivables, work
in progress and land held for the development of private housing and affordable housing through partnership schemes. As the
Group’s trade receivables relate mainly to public sector and Housing Association clients, there is no significant history of bad or
doubtful debts.

**Performance bond facilities**

The Group, like most construction businesses, relies on the use of performance bonds issued by surety companies to our clients. The
directors are pleased to report that the Group has adequate performance bonding lines in place with surety companies to meet the
Group’s growth plans.

### Directors’ Report

The directors present their annual report and the consolidated audited financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March
2018.

**Principal activities**

Keystone Midco Limited is an investment holding company heading a group of companies, which, since the disposal of the
regeneration division, are engaged in the construction of residential dwellings.

The Company’s subsidiaries are listed in note 26 to the financial statements.

**Business review and future developments**

The consolidated profit for the financial year was £115.8m (2017: £15.2m). During the year the Company paid a dividend of
£170,387,000 amounting to 100% per Ordinary share (2017: £nil), no final dividend is proposed. A review of the results, performance
and future developments for the Group are presented in the Strategic Report on page 3 which forms part of this report.

**Going concern**

The directors have considered the adequacy of the Group’s financial resources through a review of the financial projections for the
business, taking into account the facilities available to the Group, which include the extension of the Group’s revolving credit facility to
31 August 2019. The directors have also considered the covenants attaching to the facilities and the likely level of headroom available
to the Group. After careful consideration the directors are satisfied that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue
in operation for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the date of signing the financial statements. For this reason
the directors continue to apply the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

**Financial risk management**

In the course of its ordinary activities, the Group is exposed to financial risks which include liquidity, credit and interest rate risks.
These risks are monitored and managed through robust policies and procedures. Further details are included in Note 25 of the
financial statements.

Liquidity risk relates to the Group generating sufficient cash flow to meet its operational requirements while avoiding debt covenant
breaches or excessive debt levels. Total borrowings are a combination of long term loans and long term committed revolving working
capital credit facilities.

Credit risk is in relation to trade receivables from customers. Given that the majority of trade receivables are with public and regulated
organisations, the exposure to credit risk is extremely limited.

Interest rate risk relates to the impact of interest rate increases on the Group’s floating rate borrowings. At present the Group’s
revolving credit and overdraft facilities are all on a floating rate. The Group’s long term borrowings are all at fixed rates of interest.

**Directors**

The directors who held office during the year and up to the date of signing the financial statements are given below:

M A Budd

E J C Hawkes

S J Robertson

J M D Thomson

M R Priest (appointed 22 March 2018)

T M Beale (appointed 22 March 2018)

D A Sheridan (resigned 30 April 2017)

M A Budd, E J C Hawkes and S J Robertson are representatives of the Company’s shareholders, being TDR Capital LLP which has
effective control of 85% of the issued share capital of the Company whilst Sun Capital Partners has effective control of the remaining
15%.

In accordance with the Articles of Association, none of the directors are required to retire by rotation.

**Employees**

The Group believes that its success depends upon its employees and their development. Further details are provided within the
Strategic Report.

**Directors’ indemnities**

The Group maintains liability insurance for its directors and officers which remains in place up to the date of this Annual Report. The
Group has also provided an indemnity for its directors, which is a qualifying third party indemnity provision for the purposes of the
Companies Act 2006.

### Directors’ Report

**Statement of directors’ responsibilities**

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulation.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union and Group financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law). Under company law the directors
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the
directors are required to:

   - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

   - state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the Group financial statements
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the Group financial statements,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

   - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and

   - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and
Company will continue in business.

The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and
Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

**Walker Guidelines**

The directors consider the annual report and financial statements to comply with all aspects of the guidelines for transparency and
disclosure in private equity.

**Directors’ confirmations**

In the case of each director in office at the date the Directors’ Report is approved:

   - so far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group and Company’s auditors are
unaware; and

   - they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Group and Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

**Independent auditors**

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited

# Report on the audit of the group financial statements

**Our opinion**

In our opinion, Keystone Midco Limited’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”):

     - give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2018 and of its profit and cash
flows for the year then ended;

     - have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and

     - have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Financial Statements (the “Annual
Report”), which comprise: the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2018; the consolidated income statement and
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the consolidated statement
of changes in equity for the year then ended; the principal consolidated accounting policies; and the notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

_Independence_

We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

**Our audit approach**

_Overview_

                - Overall Group materiality: £1,400,000 (2017: £2,400,000), based on 5% of of profit
before tax from continuing activities, adjusted for interest on senior secured loan
notes, exceptional items and amortisation of assets acquired on acquisitions.

                - Following the disposal of the Regeneration division on 30 April 2017, for the
majority of the financial year the Group has operated as a single Homes division.
The Homes division consists of two statutory entities which, in our view, required
an audit of their complete financial information due to their size.

                - There are also a number of other group entities that contain financially significant
balances which, in our view, required an audit of these specific financial statement
line items.

                - The components over which we performed audit work represent all of the Group's
revenue from continuing operations and substantially all of the Group's operating
profit. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial
statements as a whole.

                - Carrying value of land and work in progress.

                - Presentation of exceptional items.

                - Accounting for and disclosure of Regeneration division disposal.

_The scope of our audit_

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect
of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently
uncertain.

As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating
whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

_Key audit matters_

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit
of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on:


-----

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited

the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

**_Key audit matter_** **_How our audit addressed the key audit matter_**


_Carrying value of land and work in progress_
We focused upon this area because the value of the
Group's land and work in progress represent a significant
proportion of assets in the Group statement of financial
position and determining the carrying value of land and
work in progress requires a high degree of judgement.
The key judgements include forecasting future costs to
complete which can be affected by market conditions and
unexpected events.

_Presentation of exceptional items_
We focused on this area because there is an element of
judgement involved in identifying exceptional items for
presentation as such in the Group financial statements.

_Accounting for and disclosure of Regeneration division_
_disposal_
We focused on this area given the financial significance of
the Regeneration division to the Group before its disposal,
and due to the large and one-off nature of the transaction.


We assessed the adequacy of controls over site valuations,
including costs to complete, site budget approvals, and the
authorisation and recording of costs, including testing of
controls over the allocation of costs to the correct sites.
We visited a sample of sites to confirm the existence and
condition of the work in progress, and also to evaluate the
reasonableness of the assessment of stage of completion.
We performed a 'bottom up' alternative work in progress
assessment across a number of sites, to assess the
accuracy of standard costing.
We sample tested and agreed certain costs incurred
during the year included within land and work in progress
to supporting evidence as well as reviewing the proportion
of that expenditure recognised as a cost of sale in the year
in respect of units sold.
We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s
forecasting of site development profit against those
recorded previously.
We discussed a sample of sites with central and regional
management in order to assess the reasonableness of net
realisable values and corroborated the explanations
received back to supporting documentation where
appropriate.
We performed an assessment of land and build provisions
via enquiry and corroboration to supporting evidence.
We tested the reconciliations from the site cashflows to
the accounting system.

We sample tested and agreed certain costs incurred to
supporting documentation.
We assessed whether, in our view, the costs presented as
exceptional items met the definition as such.

We reviewed the final disposal agreement and determined
whether the gain on disposal was accurately calculated
and accounted for appropriately. We also evaluated
whether the disclosures included within the Group
financial statements are in line with applicable accounting
standards.


-----

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited

_How we tailored the audit scope_

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the
financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls,
and the industry in which it operates.

Following the disposal of the Regeneration division on 30 April 2017, for the majority of the financial year the Group
has operated as a single Homes division. The Homes division consists of two statutory entities which, in our view,
required an audit of their complete financial information due to their size.

There are also a number of other group entities that contain financially significant balances which, in our view, required
an audit of these specific financial statement line items. Specific audit procedures over exceptional items, administrative
expenses, finance expenses, borrowings, and provisions were performed across these other components.

The components over which we performed audit work represent all of the Group's revenue from continuing operations
and substantially all of the Group's operating profit. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group
financial statements as a whole.

All work was performed by the Group audit team.

_Materiality_

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and
in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

**_Overall group materiality_** £1,400,000 (2017: £2,400,000).

**_How we determined it_** 5% of of profit before tax from continuing activities, adjusted for interest on senior
secured loan notes, exceptional items and amortisation of assets acquired on
acquisitions.


**_Rationale for benchmark_**
**_applied_**


The key objective of the Group is to deliver profitable growth to increase long-term
shareholder value. Due to the current capital structure of the Group, we believe an
adjusted profit basis is the appropriate benchmark to use in setting materiality.


For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was £1,000,000 and £1,260,000. Certain
components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above
£70,000 (2017: £115,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for
qualitative reasons.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you
when:

     - the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is
not appropriate; or

     - the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may
cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting
for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.


-----

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and
our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material
inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material
misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report
that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us
also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

_Strategic Report and Directors’ Report_

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report
and Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 March 2018 is consistent with the financial statements and has been
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we
did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements_

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and
fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

_Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

_Use of this report_

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions,
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose
hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the year ended 31 March 2018

**General information**

Keystone Midco Limited (the Company) is a private limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of the
registered office is Keystone Midco Limited, The Waterfront, Lakeside Boulevard, Doncaster, DN4 5PL. The nature of the Group’s
operations and its principal activities are set out in the strategic report.

The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because the Group operates exclusively in the United Kingdom. All financial
information is rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except where otherwise indicated.

**Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 as
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except investment property, available for sale
financial assets and retirement benefit assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value.

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements have been consistently applied
to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.

**Discontinued operations**

Where a major line of business has been disposed of or has been classified as held for sale, the business activity has been treated as
a discontinued operation. Following the agreement to sell Keepmoat Regeneration Holdings Limited on 1 March 2017, the
Regeneration segment of the business has been treated as a discontinued operation (note 7). The transaction completed on 30 April
2017. The post-tax profit of discontinued operations for both the current and preceding period is presented as a single line on the
Consolidated Income Statement.

**Going concern**

The directors have considered the adequacy of the Group’s financial resources through a review of the financial projections for the
business, taking into account the facilities available to the Group, which include the extension of the Group’s revolving credit facility to
31 August 2019. The directors have also considered the covenants attaching to the facilities and the likely level of headroom available
to the Group. After careful consideration the directors are satisfied that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue
in operation for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the date of signing the financial statements. For this reason
the directors continue to apply the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

**Adoption of new and revised standards**

At the date of approving these financial statements, the following new and revised standards and interpretations were in issue but
were not yet effective (and in some cases had not been adopted by the EU). None of these revised standards and interpretations
have been adopted early by the Group.

- IAS 27 (Amended) - Separate financial statements

- IAS 28 (Amended) - Investments in associates and joint ventures

- IAS 40 (Amended) – Investment property

- IFRS 7 (Amended) - Financial instruments: Disclosures

- IFRS 9 (Amended) - Financial instruments

- IFRS 15 (Amended) - Revenue from contracts with customers

- IFRS 16 (Amended) - Leases

With the exception of those mentioned below, the directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in
future periods will have a material effect on the financial position or performance of the Group and Company.

**_IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers_**

In May 2014, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ was issued, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January
2018.  For the Group, transition to IFRS 15 will take place on 1 April 2018. IFRS 15 sets out the requirements for recognising
revenue from contracts with customers. The standard uses a five-step model to apportion revenue to the individual performance
obligations within a contact.

Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised based on indicators of control, rather than solely when risks and rewards are transferred. This
can lead to differences in revenue recognition on certain sites, based on the specific contractual arrangements in place. Primarily, for
those sites in respect of which stage payments are received from registered providers of housing, revenue will be recognised based
on stage of completion rather than on legal completion. The majority of the Group’s revenue and profit, including revenue from open
market sales, will continue to be recognised on legal completion.

28


-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the year ended 31 March 2018

Management has modelled the impact on revenue and gross profit for the financial year ended 31 March 2018 and determined that
the impact would have been to reduce revenue by approximately £3.5m, the impact on gross profit would have been immaterial.

The standard also sets out the requirements for recognition of non-cash consideration as revenue.  Currently, where the Group enters
into arrangements to provide housing to registered providers at below open market value in exchange for discounted land from
partners, the associated housing unit revenue is recorded at open market value.

IFRS 15 does not permit this, as the exchange transition (land discount from partner) is not received directly from the customer
(registered provider) and so does not meet the criteria of non-cash consideration. Accordingly, the revenue recognised in respect of
these housing units will be equal to the cash consideration received from registered providers, with no market value adjustment. The
land discount will be accounted for in a similar manner to a Government grant, with the gross up in land WIP value entirely adjusted
through cost of sales rather than revenue.  This will reduce reported revenue but will have no impact on reported gross profit. If this
accounting policy had been applied during the year ended March 2019, reported revenue and cost of sales would both have been
reduced by £25.3m.

**IFRS 16 - Leases**

The IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases in January 2016. The standard sets out principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation
and disclosure of leases. The standard is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. The Group will not early
adopt the standard.

IFRS 16 removes the long-standing distinction between finance leases and operating leases and introduces a single lessee
accounting model, with some limited exemptions for short-term leases of less than 12 months and leases of low-value assets, based
on a ‘right to use’ principle.

The Group is in the process of quantifying the implications of the new standard, but expects the following impacts:

   - There is expected to be an increase in total assets, as leased assets, currently accounted for off balance sheet (i.e. classed
as operating leases under IAS 17) will be recognised on balance sheet. The biggest asset category impacted for the Group
is expected to be land and buildings.

   - There is expected to be an increase in debt, as liabilities relating to operating leases are recognised.

   - Operating lease expenditure will be reclassified and split between depreciation and finance costs. Therefore EBITDA will
increase.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Keystone Midco Limited, its subsidiary undertakings and the Group’s share
of the results of joint ventures and associates.

(a) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the
date that control ceases.

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a
subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for
control of the acquiree. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed in administrative costs as incurred. All identifiable assets and
liabilities acquired and contingent liabilities assumed are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest as compared with the Group’s share of the
identifiable net assets are recognised as goodwill. Where the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the total
consideration transferred, a gain from a bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the income statement after the fair values
initially determined have been reassessed.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised
losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Accounting
policies of acquired subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with accounting policies adopted by the Group.

29


-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the year ended 31 March 2018

(b) Joint ventures

Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, interest in joint ventures is initially
recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in
other comprehensive income.

Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds its equity accounted investment in a joint venture, the carrying amount of the equity
interest is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or
constructive obligations. Appropriate adjustment is made to the results of joint ventures where material differences exist between a
joint venture’s accounting policies and those of the Group.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is
impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of the impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of
the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in the income statement adjacent to its share of profit/(loss) from
associates.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the
joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred.

(c) Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method, applying the same
policy as set out for joint ventures above.

**Segmental reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decision maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments
has been identified as Keepmoat Limited Group’s executive directors.

**Non-current assets held for sale**

Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a
sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset (or disposal group) is
available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or
disposal groups) and the sale is highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.

When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary
are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling
interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.

Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell.

**Revenue and profit recognition**

Revenue and profit are recognised as follows:

_Private house building, property development and land sales_

Revenue and profits on these activities are included in the financial statements on legal completion.

Revenue in respect of the sale of residential properties is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable upon
legal completion. Open market sale plots are recognised at the agreed sales price deemed to be fair value, whilst sales to registered
providers are recognised at the fair value of the sale.

_Construction contracts_

Revenue on construction contracts represents the fair value of work done and excludes value added tax and trade discounts. Once
the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, margin is recognised in the income statement on a stage of contract
completion basis by reference to management’s estimate of total forecast value less total forecast costs based on the proportion of
total costs incurred to date on the contract as a whole. Provision is made in full for any potential loss on construction contracts as
soon as such losses become apparent.

Claims on customers or third parties for variations to the original contract are recognised in the income statement once entitlement to
the claim has been established. Claims by customers or third parties in respect of work carried out are recognised in the income
statement once the obligation to transfer economic benefit has become probable.

30


-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the year ended 31 March 2018

On the balance sheet, the Group reports the net contract position for each contract as either an asset or a liability. A contract
represents an asset where costs incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses) exceed progress billings; a contract
represents a liability where the opposite is the case.

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding
of the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the
significance of their nature or amount.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of
the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired at the acquisition date. It is recognised as an asset and reviewed for
impairment at least annually or when there is a triggering event, by considering the net present value of future cash flows. For the
purposes of testing for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the
value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement.

Where the fair value of the consideration given is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired,
the difference is immediately recognised in the income statement as a gain from a bargain purchase.

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating
units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.

**Intangible assets**

Other intangible assets, such as those identified on acquisition by the Group that have finite lives, are recognised at fair value and
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

Intangible assets are being amortised over the following periods, with amortisation being charged to cost of sales unless otherwise
stated:

- Contracted customer relationships – in line with expected profit generation, over a term of seven years

- Land development rights – in line with expected profit generation, varying from one to twenty years

- Computer software – on a straight line basis over three years. (Amortisation expense is included in administrative expenses)

Intangible assets with a finite useful economic useful life are tested for impairment when there is an indication that the intangible asset
may be impaired.

**Property, plant and equipment**

All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.

The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Depreciation is
calculated so as to write off the cost of each asset, less their estimated residual value, on a straight line basis over their estimated
useful economic lives, or until the date of disposal.

The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:

%

Freehold properties 2

Leasehold property improvements over the lease term

Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings 10 - 50

No depreciation is provided on freehold land

**Investment Properties**

Investment properties are initially measured at cost, being purchase price including directly attributable expenditure. Investment
properties are subsequently measured at fair value.

**Operating leases**

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

The Group rents surplus property under short and medium-term arrangements. Income is recognised over the period of lease when
the Group can reliably measure likely flow of economic benefits. These are treated as operating lease arrangements.

31


-----

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the year ended 31 March 2018

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method with an appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts recognised in the income statement when there is
objective evidence that the asset is impaired.

The carrying amount of trade receivables are reduced through the use of a provision for impairment losses. When a trade receivable
is wholly or partially uncollectible, any uncollectible amount is written off against the provision. Subsequent recoveries of amounts
previously written off are credited against the provision. Changes in the carrying amount of the provision are recognised in the income
statement.

**Impairment of financial assets**

Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been reduced. For loans and receivables, the
amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows,
discounted at the original effective interest rate.

The carrying amount of financial assets is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets except trade receivables.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss previously recognised decreases and the decrease can be objectively
related to an event that occurred after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through
the income statement.

**Inventories**

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

(a) Land held for and under development

Land held for and under development includes land purchase costs and costs directly attributable to enhancing land value.

Land may be acquired at a reduced cost, with a commitment to subsequently sell developments at a similarly reduced selling price. In
such cases the value of the land is adjusted to reflect its fair value, while the discount on the sale of developments is recognised as
deferred income within development land payables.

(b) House building developments in progress

House building developments in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct expenditure,
together with an appropriate proportion of production overheads. Net realisable value represents the estimated amount at which
inventory could be realised after allowing for costs of completion and realisation.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with bank and
other short-term highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are also included, as they are an
integral part of the Group’s cash management. In the consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in
current liabilities.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms,
particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate and
subsequently held at amortised cost. The discount to the nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to
finance costs using the effective interest rate. Changes in estimates of the final payment due are taken to inventory (land held for and
under development) and in due course, to cost of sales in the income statement.

**Loans and borrowings**

Interest bearing bank loans, senior secured notes and other borrowings are recorded initially at their fair value, net of direct transaction
and debt issue costs.

Such instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, including commitment fees, arrangement fees
and any other costs directly related to the borrowings are recognised over the term of the instrument using the effective rate of
interest.

Any instrument repaid before the end of the contractual term will result in any unamortised costs being immediately recognised in the
income statement.

**Equity instruments**

Equity instruments such as ordinary share capital issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of directly
attributable incremental issue costs. Proceeds are allocated between nominal value and share premium.

**Income tax**

Income tax expense represents the current and deferred tax charges.

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.

Current tax is the Group’s expected tax liability on taxable profits for the year using tax rates substantively enacted at the reporting
date and any adjustment to tax in respect of previous years. Where current tax losses are available but not utilised in the period, a
deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is considered recoverable.

Taxable profit differs from that reported in the income statement because it is adjusted for items of income or expense that are
assessable or deductible in other years, or are never assessable or deductible.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax rates used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised in full if future
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are only offset to the extent that that there is a legally enforceable right to
offset current tax assets and liabilities.

**Government grants**

Government grants are recognised at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions
attaching to them and the grants will be received. Grants related to purchase of assets are recognised against assets and unwound
over the useful lives of the related assets.

**Retirement benefit obligations**

(a) Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as they accrue. Differences between contributions
payable in the year and contributions actually paid are included within either accruals or prepayments on the balance sheet.

(b) Defined benefit plans

For defined benefit plans the Group’s retirement benefit obligation is recognised on the balance sheet and represents the deficit or
surplus in the Group’s defined benefit scheme. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary on an annual basis. The scheme
assets are measured using market values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit actuarial method and are
discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.

The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme expected to arise from employee
service in the period is charged to operating profit. Finance income on the scheme's assets and the increase during the period in the
present value of the scheme's liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included in net interest cost. Actuarial gains and losses
are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising on curtailment and settlements are
taken to the income statement as incurred.

Pension scheme surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented on the
face of the balance sheet.

33

### Principal consolidated accounting policies  for the year ended 31 March 2018

**Provisions**

Provisions for remedial contract obligations, vacant property obligations and restructuring costs are recognised when: the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation; and the amount has can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The
increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group’s management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions
are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised.

The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year are addressed below.

- **Goodwill and intangible assets**

IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired tangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value such
intangible assets require the use of estimates. Future results are impacted by the length of amortisation periods adopted, and
changes to the estimated useful lives which would result in different effects on the income statement and balance sheet.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, along with finite life intangible assets and other assets of the Group’s
cash generating units. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions (including discount rates, timing of
cash flows and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective.

- **Fair value on land acquired at a discount to market value**

Where the Group enters into specific arrangements with partners who provide discounted land in return for the provision of social
housing, the fair value of the housing units provided, which equates to the open market value of the discount to land, is reflected in the
financial statements. Land value in the balance sheet is therefore reflected at its fair value with this fair value being released to
revenue and cost of sales as the land is sold.

- **Estimation of costs to complete, work in progress and contract provisions**

In order to determine the profit and loss that the Group is able to recognise on its developments in a specific period, the Group has to
allocate total costs to the developments between the proportion completing in the period and the proportion to complete in a future
period. The assessment of total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation. However, Group management has established
internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made on an individual site basis.

**Site losses**

Exceptional site losses relate to a number of sites arising within the West Midlands region where significant trading issues, including
significant cost over-runs that were not adequately managed, have resulted in site losses which, by size of loss and nature, warrant a
separate presentation as exceptional items. Losses on sites were fully provided against in the year ended March 2018, with trading on
all such sites completed no later than the end of the first quarter of the following financial year. To ensure profitable on-going trading,
following detailed review, the decision was taken to close the West Midlands regional office, with the site portfolio rationalised and the
management of on-going profitable sites successfully transferred to other regional offices, fully sustaining the presence of the Group
within the Midlands region as a whole.

**Restructuring costs**

Following the disposal of the Regeneration division a corporate restructuring exercise, including redundancies, was undertaken during
the year ended March 2018 to reflect the significant change in the size and focus of the Group. As part of this a one-off supply-chain
re-engineering process was undertaken supported by external consultants. In addition, the West Midlands regional office was closed,
as described above. Exceptional restructuring costs relate to redundancy costs and consultancy fees associated with these actions.

**Onerous lease provision**

As part of the restructuring of the West Midlands region, during the year ended 31 March 2018 the Group made an onerous lease
provision in respect of the lease obligation for the regional office at Coleshill, which has become surplus to on-going operational
requirements.

**Sale of Regeneration business**

These costs relate to advisory costs incurred during the disposal of the Regeneration division, of which £5,244,000 was accrued as at
31 March 2017.

**Acquisition related fees**

During year ended 31 March 2018 the Group incurred advisor fees related to abortive merger and acquisition activity. During the year
ended 31 March 2017, the Group incurred adviser fees relating to the acquisition of MCI Developments Limited on 10 January 2017.

**Disposal of shared equity portfolio**

During the year ended 31 March 2016 the Group disposed of its entire shared equity portfolio. During the current year the Group
received £250,000 of deferred consideration.

**Impairment review of goodwill**

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. In testing
goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the recoverable amount has been determined from value in use calculations. The
key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the forecast revenue and profit, discount rates and long-term
growth rates by market sector. Future forecast revenue is based on management’s knowledge of actual results from prior years and
latest forecasts for the current year, along with secured works, management’s expectation of the future level of work available within
the market sector and expected changes in selling volumes and prices for completed houses. In establishing future profit margins, the
margins currently being achieved are considered in conjunction with expected inflation rates in each cost category and the current
market value of land being acquired.

Cash flows beyond the five year plan period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% (2017: 2%) per annum. The growth
rate used is the Group’s estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the market sectors in which the Group operates. A pre-tax
discount rate of 10.5% (2017: 11.0%) has been applied, being the estimated weighted average cost of capital of the Group.

The Group applied sensitivities to the assumptions used in the cash flows noted above and the sensitivities resulted in headroom
which was materially above the carrying value.

During the year the Group disposed of Vallum House office and land at Stanley Road for cash consideration of £570,000 making a net
gain on disposal of £30,000.

Investment property is stated at the directors’ assessment of fair value as at 31 March 2018. This reflects, amongst other things,
rental income from current leases and assumptions about rental income from future leases, in the light of current market conditions
and consideration of market evidence for similar property if appropriate.

As the amount is not material to the Group, it is not considered necessary to provide the fair value disclosures from IFRS 13.

The Group carries out a detailed annual review of the net realisable value of land held for and under development both relating to plots
currently in development, and land and phases of sites not yet in development.

Net realisable value for land where construction of homes had commenced at the year end or is anticipated to commence within the
next 12 months was assessed by estimating selling prices and costs (including sales and marketing expenses) taking into account
current market conditions.

Land where house building had not commenced at the year end and was more likely to be sold undeveloped is assessed by reappraising the land using current selling prices and costs for the proposed development and assuming an appropriate financial return
to reflect the current housing market conditions and the prevailing financing environment.

At the year end, the net realisable value provision amounts to £0.9m (2017: £1.0m). This provision will be closely monitored for
adequacy and appropriateness as regards under and over provision to reflect circumstances at future balance sheet dates.

Government grants are recognised as deferred income and are allocated to the income statement over the useful lives of the related
assets. The effect of this treatment is to reduce the fair value of work in progress by £6,687,000 (2017: £4,497,000) and to reduce cost
of sales in the income statement by £1,281,000 (2017: £2,447,000).

**Dilapidations**

The dilapidations provision covers the Group’s leased estate. A full provision up to the end of each lease was established by an
independent external valuer, with the element up to the date of the financial statements being recognised in the accounts on a prorated straight line basis.

**Other provisions**

Other provisions comprise redundancy provisions, legal fees in relation to claims and onerous lease provisions relating to the Group’s
leased estate. The onerous lease provision is calculated on a property by property basis and is calculated up to the next available
break date or end of lease, whichever is earlier.

Dilapidations and other provisions are stated at expected cost as the effects of discounting are considered to be immaterial.

**22** **Retirement benefit schemes**

**Keepmoat Pension Plan**

The Group operates the Keepmoat Limited Group Pension Plan (“KPP”), with assets held in independently administered funds. Some
members of the KPP have a defined benefit promise, which is separate to the benefits payable by the KPP, being an arrangement
between Keepmoat Limited and the applicable employees. The obligation arising under this arrangement has been calculated by a
qualified independent actuary and accounted for as a long-term employee benefit. The KPP also holds assets not attributable to
individual members (“Contingency Fund”) which can be returned to the Group and therefore has been accounted for as a current
receivable within other receivables (note 14).

The major assumptions used by the actuary to calculate the liabilities of the defined benefit obligation are:

**2018** 2017
**%** %

Discount rate **2.6%** 2.5%

**22 Retirement benefit schemes (continued)**

**Multi-employer schemes**

The multi-employer schemes formed part of the Regeneration business disposal group (note 7) and were reclassified as held for sale
as at 31 March 2017 and subsequently disposed of on 30 April 2017. The Group participated in three multi-employer schemes during
the year, namely West Yorkshire Local Government Pension Scheme (“West Yorkshire LGPS”), Durham County Council Pension
Fund (“Durham”) and West Midlands Pension Fund (“West Midlands”). The assets of these schemes were held in independently
administered funds and have been accounted for as defined benefit obligations. The Group was responsible for funding the pension
benefits for its employees only.

**23 Business combinations**

On 10 January 2017 the Group completed the acquisition of M.C.I Developments Limited a provider of packaged developments of
social housing projects for Registered Providers which operates in North West England. The fair value of consideration payable by the
Group was £23,009,000 with initial consideration paid of £12,610,000 and the fair value of deferred consideration being £10,399,000.

The following table summarises the fair value of the consideration for MCI Developments Limited:

**Consideration** **£’000**

Cash **12,610**

Fair value of deferred consideration (note 19) **10,399**

**Total consideration** **23,009**

The fair value of deferred consideration was determined using a probability weighted business plan model of the acquired business.

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018

**23** **Business combinations (continued)**

During the year the Group recognised an increase in the fair value of the deferred consideration, the fair values ascribed and resulting
goodwill have been originally recognised on a provisional basis. The increase in fair value of deferred consideration recognised was
£2,256,000 with a corresponding increase in Goodwill.

Acquisition related costs of £83,000 (2017: £353,000) have been charged to administrative expenses in the consolidated income
statement for the year ended 31 March 2018.

The consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2017 includes revenue of £10,200,000 and profit before tax of
£1,200,000 contributed by MCI Developments Limited since 10 January 2017. Had the results of MCI Developments Limited been
consolidated from the start of the reporting period, Group revenues for the year ended 31 March 2017 from continuing operations
would have been £459,200,000 whilst the loss before tax from continuing operations would have been lower at £6,800,000.

Goodwill represents the non-contractual customer relationships and land development rights that have not met the criteria for
recognition as an intangible asset, in addition to the value of the Group’s workforce.

**24** **Contingent liabilities**

The Group has entered into performance guarantees in the normal course of business which, at 31 March 2018, amounted to £14.1m
(excluding the Regeneration business) (2017: £12.6m). In the opinion of the directors, no loss will arise in respect of these
guarantees.

The Group has given guarantees in respect of the bank borrowings in addition to performance and other guarantees. At 31 March
2018 the Group had bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility of £37,500,000 (2017: £5,000,000) and bank overdrafts of
£1,868,000 (2017: £20,561,000). The Group therefore had undrawn facilities totalling £35,632,000 (2017: £49,439,000). The
guarantees are in the form of a fixed charge over certain freehold land and buildings and floating charges over the assets of certain
Group companies.

The Group is party to the Keystone Midco Limited Group (“Midco Group”) senior facility agreement whereby the Midco Group has a
revolving credit facility with a maximum facility of £75,000,000. At 31 March 2018 the Midco Group was in a net cash position (2017:
net cash position).

**25** **Financial instruments**

**Capital risk management**

The Group’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders by ensuring that the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to sustain its
present and forecast operations.

The Group monitors current and forecast cash liquidity and bond liquidity against available facilities to ensure that there is sufficient
capacity to meet requirements for the foreseeable future.

As part of its covenants, the Group also measures its leverage requirement as a ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net debt. The leverage
covenant requirement reduces over time. At 31 March 2018, the ratio of 2.45 for the year was within the required ratio of 4.20 (at 31
March 2017, the ratio of 3.31 for the year was within the required ratio of 4.80).

**Financial risks and management**

The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise senior secured notes, bank loans, subordinated shareholder loan notes, and
cash. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial
instruments including trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations.

No trading in financial instruments has been undertaken.

The Group has exposure to a variety of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. The Board reviews and agrees policies
for managing risk as well as specific policies and guidelines.

The key financial risks resulting from the Group’s use of financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018

**25 Financial instruments (continued)**

**a)** **Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meets its contractual obligations mainly arising on the Group’s
trade receivables and amounts due from construction contract customers.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited for housebuilding activities as the Group typically receives cash at the point of legal
completion of its sales.

The credit risk on registered provider sales depends on the individual characteristics of the counterparty many of whom are in the
public sector or are funded by the public sector (e.g. housing associations). The Board consider that the credit rating of these
customers is good and the credit risk on outstanding balances to be low.

The Group does not have any concentration of risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract receivables or trade
receivable balances, with receivables spread across a wide range of customers.

The ageing of trade receivables (see note 14) is as follows:

**2018** 2017

Past due 91 to 365 days **2,618** **-** 888 
Past due greater than one year **1,599** **1,519** 3,072 746

**20,948** **1,519** 24,202 746

Included within the Group’s trade receivable balance are receivables with a carrying amount of £7.2m (2017: £5.1m) which are past
due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the
Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.

The amounts due from construction contract customers and other trade receivable balances are reviewed for collectability on a routine
basis and where there are indications of impairment these are immediately recognised.

**b)** **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. An ageing profile of
the Group’s loans and borrowings is presented in note 18.

The Group’s objective is to manage liquidity by ensuring that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they become
due. This will be assessed under normal and stress conditions, without incurring losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

Following the partial redemption of the senior secured notes, the Group’s primary source of capital is £100m 9.5% Senior Secured
Notes due for repayment in 2019. Short term liquidity is managed through the use of committed bank facilities and cash. See note 18
for maturity analysis of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities.

The Group has rigorous cash management processes. Cash balances are reported daily with detailed analysis of variances to short
term cash forecasts. Short term cash forecasts are updated monthly and are for a period of 26 weeks with the first 8 weeks on a daily
basis and the remaining 18 weeks on a weekly basis. These complement a minimum of four long term quarterly cash forecasts each
year which are compared to the annual cash flow budget and to previous quarterly forecasts. These facilitate management’s
assessments of the Group’s expected cash performance and to compare to the facilities available and the Group’s covenants.

57


-----

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018

**25 Financial instruments (continued)**

**b)** **Liquidity risk (continued)**

Key risks to liquidity and cash balances are a decrease in the value of open market sales, a downturn in the UK housing market,
deterioration in credit terms obtainable in the market from suppliers and subcontractors, a downturn in the profitability of work, delayed
receipt of cash from customers and a general decline in the ability of local authorities to fund urban regeneration projects.

In order to mitigate this risk the Group continually monitors open market house sales volumes and prices; working capital levels and
contract profitability and reviews client and supplier credit references and credit terms with clients and suppliers to ensure they
continue to be appropriate.

The Group does not have any derivative financial liabilities.

**c)** **Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates, house prices and foreign exchange rates will affect the
Group income or the value of the Group’s financial instruments.

_Interest rate risk_

The Group’s exposure to changes in market interest rates is significantly mitigated as its long term borrowings comprise exclusively
fixed interest rate instruments. The committed bank facilities are at floating interest rates at a margin over the London Interbank
Borrowing Rate (LIBOR) and management continually keeps this exposure under review.

At 31 March 2018, 68% (2017: 89%) of the Group’s borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest.

_Housing market risk_

The Group is affected by price fluctuations of the UK housing market. The market is impacted by consumer demand and employment
levels and is dependent on the availability of mortgage finance. Furthermore, Government incentives, such as the “Help to Buy”
scheme, have helped to stimulate consumer demand. Whilst these risks are beyond the Group’s ultimate control, risk is spread
across differing business activities undertaken by the Group and the geographical regions in which it operates.

_Currency risk_

The Group operates entirely in the United Kingdom and all of the Group’s revenue is generated in the United Kingdom and is
denominated in pounds sterling. Consequently the Group has very limited exposure to currency risk.

**Fair values of financial instruments**

_Trade and other receivables_

The fair value of trade and other receivables, excluding construction contract receivables, is estimated as the present value of future
cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material. The carrying amount of trade
and other receivables is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

_Trade and other payables_

The fair value of trade and other payables, excluding construction contract payables, is estimated as the present value of future cash
flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material. The carrying amount of trade and
other payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated at its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand.

_Loans and borrowings_

Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest
at the balance sheet date.

Prepayments and accrued income are excluded from the trade and other receivables balances. Accruals and deferred income, noncash land commitments and statutory liabilities are excluded from trade and other payables as these are not financial instruments.

_Borrowing facilities_

At 31 March 2018, the Group had committed borrowing facilities totalling £75,000,000 (2017: £75,000,000) representing revolving
credit facilities and overdraft, which is due for renewal on 31 March 2019. At 31 March 2018 the Group had bank borrowings under
the revolving credit facility of £37,500,000 (2017: £5,000,000) and bank overdrafts of £1,868,000 (2017: £20,561,000. The Group
therefore had undrawn facilities totalling £35,632,000 (2017: £49,439,000). Revolving credit facilities bear interest at 3.00% over
LIBOR whilst cash overdrafts are 4.5% over Bank of England base rate. Performance bonds attract interest at a flat rate of 3.75%.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited - Company

# Report on the audit of the company financial statements

**Opinion**

In our opinion, Keystone Midco Limited’s company financial statements (the “financial statements”):

     - give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2018;

     - have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and
applicable law); and

     - have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Financial Statements (the “Annual
Report”), which comprise: the Company balance sheet as at 31 March 2018; and the Company statement of changes in
equity for the year then ended; the principal company accounting policies; and the notes to the company financial
statements.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

_Independence_

We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

**Our audit approach**

_Overview_

               - Overall materiality: £300,000 (2017: £2,160,000), based on 2% of total assets.

               - All balances within the Company's financial statements have been subject to a
full scope audit.

               - Carrying value of investments and inter-company receivables.

_The scope of our audit_

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect
of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently
uncertain.

As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating
whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited - Company

_Key audit matters_
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit
of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on:
the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

**_Key audit matter_** **_How our audit addressed the key audit matter_**


_Carrying value of investments and intercompany_
_receivables_

We focused upon this area because the underlying value in
the Company is represented by balances due from the
wider group and the investment held by the Company in
its subsidiaries.

The key judgement is the underlying cash generation and
profitability of the wider group which can be affected by
market conditions and unexpected events.

Following the disposal of the Regeneration division
significant dividends have flowed through the Group.

_How we tailored the audit scope_


We assessed the adequacy of controls over the forecasting
of the group and underlying controls over site valuations,
including costs to complete, site budget approvals, and the
authorisation and recording of costs, including testing of
controls over the allocation of costs to the correct sites.

We assessed the accuracy of management’s forecasting of
site development profit against actual profits recorded.

We performed sensitivity analysis over the forecasts of the
group, specifically a decline in EBITDA (focusing on a
downturn in revenue and increase in build costs) and
increase in discount rate. We noted no concerns with the
carrying value.

We assessed the dividends received and paid by the
Company specifically the ability for dividends to be paid
and the supporting documentation approving the
amounts.


We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the
financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Company, the accounting processes and
controls, and the industry in which it operates.

The Company is managed by the Keystone Midco Limited group's head office function. All balances within the
Company's financial statements have been subject to a full scope audit.

_Materiality_

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and
in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

**_Overall materiality_** £300,000 (2017: £2,160,000).

**_How we determined it_** 2% of total assets.


**_Rationale for benchmark_**
**_applied_**


The key objective of the parent company is to hold investments in the various
group companies. As a result, we believe total assets is the primary measure used
by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the parent company and is
therefore the appropriate benchmark to use in setting materiality.


We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above
£15,000 (2017: £108,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for
qualitative reasons.

### Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Keystone Midco Limited - Company

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you
when:

     - the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is
not appropriate; or

     - the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may
cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and
our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material
inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material
misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report
that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us
also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

_Strategic Report and Directors’ Report_

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report
and Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 March 2018 is consistent with the financial statements and has been
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit,
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements_

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and
fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

_Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

### Notes to the financial statements - Company for the year ended 31 March 2018

**Basis of preparation**

The Company financial statements of Keystone Midco Limited have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (“FRS 101”) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical
cost convention except available for sale financial assets which have been measured at fair value.

The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. All financial information is rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except
where otherwise indicated. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements have been
consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.

FRS 101 allows the income statement and balance sheet to be presented in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS)
1 - Presentation of Financial Statements.

A summary of the disclosure exemptions adopted for the year ended 31 March 2018 is presented below. Equivalent disclosures for
financial instruments are included in the Keepmoat Midco Limited Group consolidated financial statements allowing the exemptions to
be applied.

**Area** **Disclosure exemption**

Cash flow statements Exemption from preparing a cash flow statement. (IAS 7)

Financial instrument Exemption from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments) and related IFRS
disclosures 13 disclosures.

Exemption from the disclosures in respect of management’s objectives, policies and processes for
managing capital (IAS1.134 to 136).

Comparative information Exemption from comparative disclosure for movements on share capital, property, plant and
equipment, intangibles and investment property.

Related party disclosures Exemption for related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group,
provided that any subsidiary which is party to a transaction is wholly owned by such a member.

Exemption from disclosure of key management personnel compensation.

Presentation of Financial Exemption from statement of compliance with IFRS, cash flow information and capital
Statements management policy.

The Company has consistently and uniformly applied the accounting policies of the Group set out on pages 28 to 35 insofar as they
are applicable to the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and subject to the disclosure exemptions
above.

**Investments**

Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are recorded in the Company’s balance sheet at cost less any impairment.
The directors review the investments for impairment when there are indicators of possible impairment.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Company’s management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions
are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they are revised.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.

**_Impairment of investments_**

Determining whether investments are impaired requires an estimate of the future discounted cash flows of each investment.
Discounted cash flows and assumptions (including discount rates, timing of cash flows and growth prospects) are inherently subjective
and largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Company.

**29** **Employees and directors**

The Company does not have any employees (2017: nil).

**Directors’ emoluments**

See note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details of directors’ emoluments.
