**$1,150,000,000    % Senior Notes due 2029**

PetSmart, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is expected to be converted to a Delaware limited liability company prior to consummation of this offering (“PetSmart”), and PetSmart Finance Corp.,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart (the “Corporate Co-Issuer” and, together with PetSmart, the “Issuers” and each an “Issuer”), are offering $1,200,000,000
aggregate principal amount of     % senior first lien notes due 2028 (the “senior first lien notes”) and $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of     % senior notes due 2029 (the “senior
notes” and, together with the senior first lien notes, the “notes”).

The senior first lien notes will mature on    , 2028. The senior notes will mature on    , 2029. We will pay interest on the senior first lien notes and the senior notes semi-annually in arrears
on     and     of each year, commencing on    , 2021. We may redeem some or all of the senior first lien notes and the senior notes at any time prior to     , 2024, in each case, at a
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described
in this offering memorandum. On or after    , 2024, we may redeem some or all of the senior first lien notes and the senior notes, in each case, at the applicable redemption prices set forth in
this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to       , 2024, we may redeem up to 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of the senior first lien notes during each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior first lien notes to be
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. We may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of each of the
senior first lien notes and the senior notes at any time prior to    , 2024, in each case, at the applicable redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum with an amount equal to or less
than the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of Senior First Lien Notes—Optional
Redemption” and “Description of Senior Unsecured Notes—Optional Redemption.” Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as described herein), we may be required to make an offer to
repurchase all of the notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. See “Description of Senior
First Lien Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control” and “Description of Senior Unsecured Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

The notes will rank equal in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ existing and future senior indebtedness, including obligations under the new senior secured credit facilities (as defined herein),
and senior in right of payment to all of Issuers’ future subordinated indebtedness. Each of the Issuers’ existing and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that will guarantee the
new term loan facility (as defined herein) and certain capital markets debt will guarantee the notes on a joint and several basis (each, a “subsidiary guarantor” and such guarantees, the “subsidiary
guarantees”). In addition, until such time that PetSmart’s Consolidated Total Debt Ratio (as defined herein) is equal to or less than 2.00:1.00 (as calculated pursuant to each of the indentures
governing the notes), the notes will be guaranteed by a recently formed domestic limited liability company (the “Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor” and together with the subsidiary guarantors,
the “guarantors”), which will hold certain shares of Chewy, Inc.’s (“Chewy”) common stock (such guarantee, the “affiliate guarantee” and, together with the subsidiary guarantee, each, a “note
guarantee”). Such note guarantees will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of such guarantors, including guarantees of obligations under the new senior
secured credit facilities and senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of such guarantors. The notes and the related subsidiary guarantees will be structurally
subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any of the Issuers’ existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes, including PetSmart’s Canadian nonguarantor subsidiary that will be a borrower under the new ABL facility (as defined herein). To the extent lenders under PetSmart’s new senior secured credit facilities release any guarantor
(including the guarantee by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor) from its obligations, such guarantor will also be released from its obligations under its note guarantees. See “Description of
Senior First Lien Notes—Guarantees” and “Description of Senior Unsecured Notes—Guarantees.”

The Issuers expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with the net proceeds of an equity contribution described herein, borrowings under PetSmart’s new term loan facility and
cash on hand, to fund the early redemption, repurchase or repayment (including by satisfaction and discharge) in full of the following outstanding debt, and to pay related fees, costs, premiums
and expenses in connection therewith: PetSmart’s (i) outstanding borrowings under its existing term loan facility, (ii) outstanding 7.125% senior notes due 2023 (the “2023 senior notes”), (iii)
outstanding 5.875% senior first lien notes due 2025 (the “2025 senior first lien notes”) and (iv) outstanding 8.875% senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 senior notes” and, together with the 2025
senior first lien notes and the 2023 senior notes, the “existing notes”). Any remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. See “Use of Proceeds.”

The senior first lien notes and the related note guarantees will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the cash flow collateral (as defined herein) that will also secure the new term loan
facility on a first-priority basis, and a second-priority security interest in the ABL collateral (as defined herein) that will secure the new ABL facility on a first-priority basis and will also secure
the new term loan facility on a second-priority basis. See “Description of Senior First Lien Notes—Security for the Notes.” In addition, until such time that PetSmart’s Consolidated Total Debt
Ratio (as defined herein) is equal to or less than 2.00:1.00 (as calculated pursuant to the indenture governing the senior first lien notes), the senior first lien notes and the related note guarantees
will be secured on a first-priority basis by a pledge of Chewy’s common stock that is held by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, which collateral will also secure the new term loan facility
and any other first lien obligations of the Issuer on a first priority basis and the new ABL facility on a second-priority basis. See “Description of Senior First Lien Notes—Security for the Notes—
Pledge of Chewy Stock.” The senior notes and the related note guarantees (including the guarantee by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor) will not be secured by any collateral. The senior
notes and the related note guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, including indebtedness under the new senior secured credit facilities
and the senior first lien notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.


The notes will not be listed on any stock exchange, and currently there is no public market for the notes.

**We and the initial purchasers have not authorized anyone to provide you with any information other**
**than that contained in this offering memorandum. We take no responsibility for, and can provide no assurance**
**as to the reliability of, any other information that others may give you.**

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about     , 2021, which
is the    business day following the date of the pricing of the notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as
“T+  ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in
the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the
next     succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+ , to
specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the
notes who wish to trade the notes during such period should consult their own advisors.

**We and the initial purchasers are offering to sell the notes only in places where offers and sales are**
**permitted.**

**You should not assume that the information contained in this offering memorandum is accurate as of**
**any date other than the date on the front cover of this offering memorandum. Neither the delivery of this**
**offering memorandum nor any sale made hereunder shall under any circumstances imply that the information**
**in this offering memorandum is correct as of any date after the date on the cover of this offering memorandum.**

**PetSmart Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information**

Our fiscal years consist of 52 or 53-weeks and end on the Sunday nearest to January 31st. Fiscal year 2019,
which ended on February 2, 2020, was a 52-week year. Fiscal year 2018, which ended on February 3, 2019, was a 53week year. Fiscal year 2017, which ended on January 28, 2018, was a 52-week year. Unless otherwise specified, all
references to years and quarters in these consolidated financial statements are to fiscal years and fiscal quarters. Each
fiscal year generally consists of four 13-week fiscal quarters, with each fiscal quarter ending on the Sunday that is
closest to the last day of the last month of the quarter.

Unless otherwise stated herein, pro forma financial information for the twelve-months ended November 1,
2020 gives pro forma effect to the Transactions in the manner described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information of PetSmart” and any other pro forma financial information, including for the thirty-nine weeks ended
November 1, 2020, the fiscal years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019 and January 28, 2018 and the thirtynine weeks ended November 3, 2019, gives pro forma effect to the Chewy Distribution as if it had occurred on the
last day preceding the respective period (in the case of statement of operations data) or on the last day of the respective
period (in the case of balance sheet data). The pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma financial information
included herein are based upon available data and certain estimates and assumptions we believe are reasonable. The
summary unaudited pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only, is not prepared in accordance
with Article 11 of Regulation S-X as would be required in an offering of securities registered with the SEC, and does
not purport to represent the results of operations or financial position that PetSmart would actually obtain if the
transactions occurred at any date, nor does such data purport to project the results of operations for any future period.
Certain historical operating data of PetSmart presented herein is also reflective of PetSmart as a standalone company.

**Chewy Historical Financial Information**

For historical periods, Chewy is consolidated in PetSmart’s audited and unaudited financial statements.
We have included herein certain financial information with respect to Chewy on a standalone basis, including
summary financial information as of and for the twelve-months ended November 1, 2020 under “Unaudited Pro
Form Financial Information of PetSmart,” and we have also provided certain financial data that distinguishes the
operations of Chewy under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.” This summary financial information with respect to Chewy is not prepared in accordance with Rule
13-02 of Regulation S-X as would be required in an offering of securities registered with the SEC.

We have not included separate financial statements or financial information with respect to the Chewy
Stock Affiliate Guarantor. The Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor has no independent operations and will have no
material assets other than its ownership of the Pledged Chewy Stock that will be pledged to secure the senior first
lien notes and other first lien obligations on a first-priority basis and the new ABL facility on a second-priority basis.

-----

We have provided certain financial data in this offering memorandum with respect to the liabilities of the Chewy
Stock Affiliate Guarantor.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

In addition to financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States (“GAAP”), such as net income, our management uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash
Flow, Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Free
Cash Flow, Pro Forma Revenue, Pro Forma Operating Expenses, Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Net Sales, Pro
Forma Adjusted Gross Profit, and Pro Forma Capital Expenditures, each of which is a non-GAAP measure.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Pro Forma
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Free Cash Flow, Pro
Forma Revenue, Pro Forma Operating Expenses, Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Net Sales, Pro Forma Adjusted
Gross Profit, and Pro Forma Capital Expenditures, as presented in this offering memorandum, are supplemental
measures of our performance that are not required by, and are not presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Gross Profit are measures commonly used by financial analysts in
evaluating a company’s performance and/or ability to service and/or incur indebtedness. We present Pro Forma
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Free Cash Flow, Pro
Forma Revenue, Pro Forma Operating Expenses, Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Net Sales, Pro Forma Adjusted
Gross Profit, and Pro Forma Capital Expenditures as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free
Cash Flow, Adjusted Gross Profit and capital expenditures, in each case, as adjusted or further adjusted for (i) the
Chewy Distribution and (ii) in the case of the twelve months ended November 1, 2020, the Transactions as if such
transactions had occurred and were fully reflected throughout and at the end of such periods, and are adjusted to reflect
such transactions based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
Accordingly, we believe that Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
Margin, Pro Forma Free Cash Flow, Pro Forma Revenue, Pro Forma Operating Expenses, Pro Forma Net Income,
Pro Forma Net Sales, Pro Forma Adjusted Gross Profit and Pro Forma Capital Expenditures may be useful for potential
purchasers of the notes in assessing our operating performance and our ability to meet our debt service requirements.
These non-GAAP financial measures, as used herein, are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of
other companies. The items excluded from such non-GAAP financial measures are significant in assessing our
operating results and liquidity.

These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in
isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For instance, some of the limitations
associated with EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA,
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Free Cash Flow, Pro Forma Revenue, Pro Forma Operating
Expenses, Pro Forma Net Income and Pro Forma Net Sales, are:

  - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect costs or
cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

  - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

  - they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments, on our debt;

  - they do not reflect period-to-period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income
taxes;

  - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative
of our ongoing operations;

  - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will
often have to be replaced in the future, and they do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and

vi


-----

  - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness
as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this offering memorandum and
the related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or
to reduce indebtedness.

In calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Gross
Profit, Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Free
Cash Flow, Pro Forma Revenue, Pro Forma Operating Expenses, Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma Net Sales, Pro
Forma Adjusted Gross Profit and Pro Forma Capital Expenditures, we make certain adjustments that are based on
assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation
of these adjustments as a projection that we will achieve any underlying results but rather only as an indication of our
current expectations and to show how Adjusted EBITDA will be calculated for the purposes of monitoring covenant
compliance in the credit agreements governing the new senior secured credit facilities and the indentures that will
govern the notes.

In addition, in evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA Margin,
Adjusted Gross Profit, Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin,
Pro Forma Free Cash Flow, Pro Forma Revenue, Pro Forma Operating Expenses, Pro Forma Net Income, Pro Forma
Net Sales, Pro Forma Adjusted Gross Profit, and Pro Forma Capital Expenditures, you should be aware that in the
future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation
of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Pro Forma
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Free Cash Flow, Pro
Forma Adjusted Gross Profit and Pro Forma Capital Expenditures should not be construed as an inference that our
future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. For more information, see the financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use of non-GAAP financial measures. These rules require, among
other things:

  - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures
calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and

  - a statement disclosing the purposes for which the issuers’ management uses the non-GAAP financial
measure.

The rules prohibit, among other things:

  - exclusion of charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement absent
an ability to settle in another manner, from non-GAAP liquidity measures;

  - adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as nonrecurring,
infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to recur; and

  - presentation of non-GAAP financial measures on the face of the GAAP financial statements (or notes thereto)
or any pro forma financial information.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this offering memorandum may not comply with these rules.

_Presentation.”_

**PetSmart Overview**

PetSmart is North America’s leading specialty provider of products, services and solutions for the lifetime
needs of pets. Since opening its first store in 1987, the Company has grown to operate 1,650 stores in the United States,
Puerto Rico and Canada as of November 1, 2020. PetSmart serves a large group of pet owners it calls “pet parents,”
customers who are passionately committed to their pets and consider them members of the family. The Company is
committed to developing moment-making products, services and experiences for pet parents, including inviting pet
parents to shop with their pets, which the Company believes creates an enjoyable and memorable shopping experience.

PetSmart stores carry a broad assortment of high-quality pet supplies for all the life stages of pets, including
nationally recognized brand names as well as an extensive selection of private brands, across a range of product
categories. The Company complements its extensive product assortment with a wide selection of services, including
professional grooming and boarding for cats and dogs, as well as training and day camp for dogs. Most stores feature
pet styling salons that provide high-quality grooming services for dogs, and many of the pet styling salons provide
services for cats. The business generated $7.6 billion in pro forma net sales and $1,269.0 million in pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA for the twelve months ended November 1, 2020.

**_PetSmart at a Glance [(1) ]_**

(1) “Market share in specialty pet retail” includes only pet specialty channel per third-party estimates. “Mature stores” is defined as
locations that are three or more years old. Pro forma Free Cash Flow is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure; see “—Summary Historical
and Pro Forma Financial and Other Data” for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure.

**_Retail Footprint_**

PetSmart has an extensive retail footprint with significant presence across the core U.S. market. Of its 1,650
stores, 91% are located in the U.S., with the remaining 9% in Canada and Puerto Rico. Stores are strategically located,
with a geographically diversified presence across favorable demographic profiles. For example, stores are in regions
with 1.5x the average U.S. household income and where population growth is expected to be 1.5x larger than recent
historical rates in the U.S., based on U.S. census data. Furthermore, as of the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020, more
than 60% of PetSmart’s revenue was generated from stores with strong co-tenancy (a major retailer such as Target,
Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, Lowe’s or a grocer), which serves to enhance customer traffic in the area. Very few
stores are located in enclosed malls.

**_Recent Focus_**

The Company’s portfolio of stores generates strong margins and cash flows. Following acceleration of online
growth from Chewy and Amazon in 2016 and movement of two of the largest channel-exclusive brands into the Food,
Drug and Mass (“FDM”) channel in 2016 and 2017, PetSmart has shifted its strategy to focus on services, private
brands and specialty products as well as improved merchandising strategy to bring in new and growing brands to
enhance its value proposition to pet parents, which have provided PetSmart with a path to recovery and further growth.
As such, comparable sales have seen continuous sequential improvement over the last two years, reaching positive
comparable sales in the second half of fiscal year 2019 and accelerating through the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the
long-term, comparable sales continue to benefit from positive trends around new pet ownership, increased consumer
spending and continued humanization of pets.

PetSmart leverages growing omni-channel capabilities to enhance its leading brick and mortar position and
to meet the changing needs of customers. The omni-channel offering consists of Buy-Online-Pick-Up-in Store
(“BOPIS”) including curbside pickup, Ship-to-Home (“STH”), and Ship-from-Store (“SFS”). PetSmart also has a
partnership with DoorDash Inc., a digital delivery service provider, where the Company partners to provide ondemand, same-day delivery service to customers across 1,618 retail locations. Despite a number of e-commerce
options available for pet parents throughout the pandemic, customers have continued shopping at PetSmart whether
in-store or through omni-channel offerings. The omni-channel strategy is focused on complementing the core brick
and mortar business, positioning PetSmart to continue to gain market share in the growing brick and mortar pet retail
category.

With over 40 million member profiles, the Treats™ loyalty program provides rich customer data to better
understand consumer preferences and purchasing trends. This large customer database gives PetSmart a competitive
edge in data intelligence over smaller competitors.

**_Merchandise_**

(1) Pro forma Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated based on PetSmart’s Pro Forma Gross Profit for a given period and division, as
adjusted to add back certain items, over PetSmart’s net sales for such period and division. Pro forma Adjusted Gross Margin and Pro
Forma Gross Profit are non-GAAP financial measures. See “—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial and Other Data” for a
reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures.
(2) Services revenue includes fees paid to PetSmart from Banfield, a veterinary services provider partnered with PetSmart that operates
most of the Company’s in-store veterinary clinics, and does not include POS fees.

The merchandise offering generally falls into three main categories: consumables, which includes dog and
cat food and treats as well as cat litter products; hardgoods, which includes dog and cat supplies ranging from “fun &
fashion” items (toys, apparel, beds, collars, leashes, etc.) to “problem & solution” items (grooming and beauty,
healthcare and supplements, flea and tick, travel, containment, waste management, etc.); and specialty, which includes
fresh-water fish, small birds, reptiles and other small pets as well as the consumables and hard goods for them.
Merchandise accounted for 87% of the Company’s total net sales for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020, with
consumables, hardgoods and specialty contributing 46%, 27% and 13%, respectively. PetSmart carries the largest pet
merchandise assortment among pet specialty, mass, grocery or other discount retailers, with over 19,500 SKUs and
more than 700 unique brands offered in retail locations and on petsmart.com and onlynaturalpet.com, including
nationally recognized brands as well as an extensive selection of private brands across a wide range of product
categories. The product portfolio is also well-diversified, with no third-party brand representing more than 5% of pro
forma total merchandise sales.

3


-----

Within consumables, PetSmart emphasizes channel-exclusive natural, science-based and therapeutic pet
foods, many of which are not available in grocery stores, warehouse clubs or other mass and general merchandise
retailers. In addition to channel-exclusive products described below, PetSmart offers private brands as well as widely
distributed quality brands in order to provide pet parents with a broad selection of consumables products.

The hardgoods offering is differentiated due to its broad value range, its curated selection and extensive
private and exclusive offerings driven by innovation generated by in-house product development and direct sourcing
capabilities. PetSmart designs and sources a significant portion of hardgoods and specialty items through its product
development office in Phoenix, Arizona, and two sourcing offices in Shanghai and Hong Kong. PetSmart has the
largest selection of products within the brick and mortar pet retail segment.

The specialty offering is a key differentiator against competitors who do not offer live animals or products
for specialty pets, which PetSmart believes serve as an entry point to pet ownership for many younger pet parents.
Also, the in-store fish wall and habitats with reptiles, birds and small and furry pets create a theater to drive traffic.

The Company’s position as the #1 pet care destination, strong relationships with leading product vendors and
educated, passionate and highly trained in-store employees (“associates”) allow PetSmart to offer products that are
exclusively sold (“channel-exclusive”) by pet specialty retailers and not through other retail channels. PetSmart also

4


-----

offers a selection of private brands across consumables, hardgoods and specialty, which represented approximately
30% of merchandise sales for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020, reflecting an approximately 700 basis points
increase in penetration over the last five years. The private consumables offering includes products exclusively sold
at PetSmart and Chewy, such as the Simply Nourish®, Authority® and Only Natural Pet® brands, which generally
carry higher margins than similar branded product. Customers purchasing widely distributed consumables brands
often purchase higher margin hardgoods and specialty products as well, resulting in a positive ticket and creating an
opportunity to upsell these customers to channel exclusive consumables.

**_Services_**

PetSmart is the #1 pet services provider in North America. In substantially all stores, the Company offers
both professional grooming in dedicated salons and specialized training services. It also offers boarding through 207
PetsHotels and veterinary care through 809 third-party pet hospitals which are co-located within stores. The services
offering allows the Company to build trust and loyalty with customers, driving increased traffic to stores and
differentiating the Company from competitors across channels, including specialty retailers, mass, grocery, and online.
Importantly, services cannot be offered online, thus shielding PetSmart from e-commerce competitors. Over the last
five years through fiscal year 2019, services penetration as a percentage of overall PetSmart sales has increased
approximately 120 basis points to 12.4%. Internal data suggests that customers who purchase services transact 1.7x
more regularly and spend 2.1x more annually than non-services customers, and PetSmart estimates that more than
half of services customers also purchase goods. The Company believes that no competitor comes close to its breadth
of services and physical coverage.

**Our Strategy**

PetSmart is committed to developing differentiated, moment-making products, services and experiences that
will attract and retain pet parents as loyal PetSmart customers. The Company has significant opportunities to further
enhance its leadership position in the pet care industry and improve the productivity of stores.

PetSmart believes it has a competitive advantage through unique in-store and omni-channel solutions for pet
parents, including differentiated products and services for pets and exceptional customer service. The Company’s
stores and websites (petsmart.com and onlynaturalpet.com) carry a broad assortment of high-quality pet merchandise
across consumables, hardgoods and what the Company refers to as the “specialty” category. The comprehensive
merchandise offering, with over 19,500 SKUs and more than 700 unique brands offered in retail locations and on

5


-----

petsmart.com, caters to a wide range of pet parents and provides nearly every item needed to satisfy the lifetime needs
of their pets. In addition, the growing assortment and selection of private and exclusive brands enhance customer
loyalty. PetSmart is also the leading provider of pet services (e.g., professional grooming, boarding, training, day
camp, etc.) in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, further strengthening the Company’s value proposition to customers
and differentiating from others in the pet space. PetSmart maintains a content website to further engage with customers.

PetSmart will continue to focus on driving comparable sales, expanding margins and generating Free Cash
Flow through the following key business strategies:

**_Winning through a disciplined approach to growth_**

PetSmart’s business is anchored by four key management principles: be efficient, be margin-focused, be
consumer-insight driven and be an aggressive competitor through continued share gains in brick and mortar. PetSmart
has been able to generate cost savings through increased labor efficiencies within stores and rent savings, both of
which have become particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. These four principles have informed the
Company’s over-arching strategy since BC Partners took ownership. PetSmart has dedicated significant time and
resources to increasing efficiency, improving its margin profile, refining its customer analytics and competing
aggressively with competitors across channels.

**_Enhancing value proposition by complementing our competitive advantages in brick and mortar with omni-_**
**_channel capabilities_**

PetSmart continues to focus on winning market share in the growing brick and mortar pet retail category by
providing best-in-class in-store merchandise and service offerings complemented by convenient omni-channel
capabilities. Brick and mortar pet retail category has demonstrated resilience despite industry shift to online, growing
by a CAGR of 0.3% from 2015 to 2019, while online penetration increased from just 7% to 22% during that same
time period. Outside of online, brick and mortar is still expected to represent approximately 65% of pet products in
2024, which implies a future expected growth of 1.5%-2.0% per annum. We believe PetSmart is uniquely positioned
to benefit from this growth with its nationwide reach, unmatched merchandise portfolio, which includes new emerging
brands, private brands and specialty, and its robust service offerings, creating a preferred destination for pet parents
and their pets’ everyday needs. PetSmart’s omni-channel capabilities complement the Company’s in-store offering by
providing multiple avenues for customers to interact with PetSmart, driving loyalty and traffic to stores. PetSmart
focuses its efforts on building capabilities designed to drive value through the store base as evidenced by recent
investments made in BOPIS, the preferred omni-channel option for customers, representing 75% of pro forma omnichannel sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, and the PRISM scheduling system, an online and
app-based scheduling tool for services. These investments are designed to enhance the store base profitability and
provide an omni-channel experience for customers while not impacting free cash flow generation. PetSmart also offers
STH and SFS at select locations, as well as a same-day delivery service through its new partnership with DoorDash
Inc., providing an on-demand option to customers.

In addition, PetSmart engages with customers through its leading websites, petsmart.com (one of the most
visited pet websites in the U.S.) and onlynaturalpet.com, and its PetSmart app. Pet education resources available on
these digital channels enhance brand value and drive in-store visits and services sales.

PetSmart will continue to leverage omni-channel capabilities to connect with customers, enhance the in-store
experience and drive store traffic to execute on its core strategy to continue being the leading brick and mortar pet
retailer.

**_Providing pet parents with the largest assortment of pet products with a focus on new and growing brands, private_**
**_brands and specialty products_**

PetSmart carries the widest assortment of products across pet merchandise categories, from the value end to
premium end of the product spectrum, and from widely distributed to private or exclusive. Furthermore, the Company
makes it a priority to focus on offering a curated and unique assortment of products that is not widely available for pet
parents by competitors. PetSmart believes in diversifying its brand exposure and enhancing its merchandise offering

The strategic focus is to continue to execute on and expand merchandising capabilities in key areas including:

     - _Newness to the store: PetSmart is constantly looking to capitalize on new trends, find emerging_
product categories and add new brands to the portfolio, whether from existing vendors or new
entrants to the industry. Introducing newness to the store and pursuing innovative brands and
products remains a key strategic priority, and PetSmart plans to continue to add differentiated and
innovative brands to its product assortment each year. PetSmart also offers a large assortment of
private brands which further drives innovation and new experiences in-store. PetSmart will continue
to work closely with vendors in order to deliver a diverse and relevant product offering at
competitive prices.

     - _Private brands: Private brands are only sold by PetSmart and in limited cases, Chewy, and generate_
significant value for the platform. Private brands guarantee exclusivity, have more attractive
margins than non-private brand products and have protected pricing given the absence of a direct
price comparison. Private brand customers are significantly more valuable than the overall
population, spending more on non-private brand products and shopping more frequently, while also
having a longer overall tenure. Through introducing new brands and improving upon existing
brands, PetSmart, excluding Chewy, has grown private and exclusive penetration from 20% of pro
forma merchandise sales in fiscal year 2011 to over 33% of pro forma merchandise sales during the
twelve month period ended November 1, 2020. The private brand portfolio includes brands such as
Authority, Only Natural Pet and Simply Nourish in Consumables, Top Paw, Arcadia Trail and
Whisker City in hardgoods, and Thrive, All Living Things and Top Fin in specialty. PetSmart
expects to further build on the success of the Company’s private brands and incorporate new
PetSmart-exclusive formulations and sub-brands.

     - _Specialty: The specialty category is an area of differentiation for PetSmart as many of its brick and_
mortar competitors cannot match the Company’s breadth in specialty products or customer service
expertise. Further, as customers cannot easily buy live pets online, specialty is partially insulated
from e-commerce competition. Specialty customers are more likely to be repeat visitors and also
tend to shop more frequently on average than the overall population, presenting incremental upside
for cross-sell opportunities. Over the last five years, PetSmart has increased its specialty category
penetration by approximately 130 basis points while expanding category market share in both brick
and mortar and pet specialty retail by approximately 200 basis points. PetSmart’s differentiated
capabilities in specialty uniquely position the Company to further capitalize on this attractive pet
category.

**_Growing and expanding on our comprehensive service offerings to improve the pet parent experience_**

Over the past twenty years, PetSmart has built from the ground up the leading services offering in the pet
industry, and continues to grow this integral part of the business which serves as a key differentiator versus competitors
across brick and mortar and e-commerce. Services include professional grooming, boarding, training, day camp and
other offerings. Unable to be replicated online, the services business drives store traffic, builds customer loyalty, and
shields PetSmart from e-commerce competitors. It also allows for cross-selling and upselling opportunities as
PetSmart acts as a “one stop shop” for customers. Services customers are significantly more valuable than the overall
population, spending more on merchandise, shopping more frequently and having a longer average tenure.

PetSmart made important investments in the services business over the past two years, which helped increase
productivity and improve customer experience. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of certain
services offerings, the services segment performed well with 3.8% comparable sales growth during the third fiscal
quarter of 2019 and 6.4% during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019. Technological improvements around customer
booking, appointment management, and payment process enabled by the new PRISM scheduling system provides for
a seamless customer experience and drove an increase in appointment capacity of approximately 15%. Other digital
innovations support marketing efforts to drive demand, reduce inefficiencies in administrative tasks, and improve
cancellation rates via automated appointment reminders. The Company also allocated additional staffing to the

services business, increasing the number of groomers to improve productivity, enabling salons to support their
projections. PetSmart remains focused on improving the quality and consistency of services through extensive,
structured training of employees in all pet services areas. There is an opportunity to further enhance average
transaction value by equipping store associates with tools that better enable them to identify pet parents’ needs and
provide appropriate solutions.

The non-medical pet services category represents the fastest growing retail category based on three-year
historical growth from 2017 to 2019, representing a CAGR of over 6%. Furthermore, spending on non-medical pet
services from 2014 to 2017 grew at over 7%. As the leading pet services provider in a highly fragmented market,
PetSmart is well-positioned to benefit from the strong market dynamics and remain focused on services as a key
strategic priority.

**_Continuing to support pet-related charitable works, including adoptions, which drive pet ownership and creates_**
**_goodwill for the brand_**

Customer analytics show that charitable endeavors are among the top drivers of customer loyalty and buying
intent for PetSmart stores. PetSmart provides space in most stores for pet adoptions through a partnership with
PetSmart Charities (an independent non-profit organization). PetSmart Charities facilitates more pet adoptions than
any other organization with approximately 20% of all pets adopted in the United States in 2019 through PetSmart
stores in partnership with 4,000 animal welfare organizations. In March 2020, PetSmart Charities marked its most
successful national adoption weekend event in its 25-year history, facilitating the adoption of nearly 33,000 pets. This
event brought total pets adopted through PetSmart Charities to 9.2 million. PetSmart Charities is the leading funder
of animal welfare in North America.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Large and Attractive Industry Growing at Approximately 5% Historically_**

The pet care industry is a large and highly attractive category. Supported by secular tailwinds including
increased pet ownership, the continued humanization of pets and the premiumization of pet food, the category reached
$95 billion in total sales in 2019. The sector has also demonstrated higher growth than any other category within retail,
growing at a CAGR of approximately 5% from 2014 to 2019. This growth trajectory is anticipated to continue, as the
forecasted CAGR from 2020 through 2024 is 5.7%.

**U.S. Pet Retail Sales (dollars in billions)**

**Historical Segment Growth (2017-2019 CAGR)**

-----

The pet care industry is also one of the most recessionary resistant categories, as increased adoption rates and
effects of pet humanization more than offset any decreases in household spending during economic downturns. During
the last recession, total category CAGR of approximately 6% was driven by an increase in pet ownership, partially
offset by a slight decrease in average household spending on pet products according to the American Pet Products
Association (“APPA”). Pet parents have consistently reduced spending on their pets less than on themselves during
recessionary events, and this trend has continued during the COVID pandemic.

**Pet Care Performance through the “Great Recession” (dollars in billions)**

**_Secular Industry Tailwinds Accelerating with COVID-19 Pandemic_**

The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated tailwinds supporting the sector, including increased pet
ownership, the continued humanization of pets and the premiumization of pet food. Pet adoption rates have increased
through the COVID-19 pandemic as the U.S. population has turned to pets to support mental and physical well-being
during periods of self-isolation. In addition, stay-at-home orders and flexible work schedules have given households
the freedom to care for new pets as people spend more time at home. In 2020, the number of pet-owning households
in the United States is expected to increase by 4% year-over-year, reaching approximately 71 million.

9


-----

In total, it is estimated that approximately 41.0% (or 51.3 million) of households owned dogs and 25.0% (or
31.4 million) of households owned cats as pets in the United States in calendar year 2020, representing a growth in
number of dog and cat owning households by 5% and 4% respectively compared to 2019. In addition, younger
consumers are spending more money on their pets, with a lower percentage of Millennials (ages 19-36) reporting that
they are “budget-conscious” with regards to pet care spending as compared to older pet parents. The “premiumization”
of pet food has also increased customer’s ticket size, and the longer average lives of pets has increased the number of
purchases over the duration of a pet’s life.

**U.S. Pet Households (in millions) and Approach to Spending**

**Humanization and Premiumization Trends Are Key Growth Drivers to the Industry**

Pet supply and pet food retailers are expected to collectively experience an acceleration of growth to 7.7%
(excluding services) in fiscal year 2020, supported by their classification as essential businesses during the COVID19 pandemic. Additionally, there is a positive tailwind coming from increased pet adoptions during quarantine, which
is expected to translate to an increase of 4% year-over-year of pet owning households in fiscal year 2020 and we
believe should offset any trade-down as a result of economic challenges.

Both medical and non-medical pet services (e.g., grooming, trainings, hotel, etc.) have been affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic as they were forced to close or operate at reduced capacity due to social distancing requirements.
Collectively, vet services and non-medical pet services are expected to be down (13%) in fiscal year 2020. Both are
expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels and return to approximately 5% growth as the situation normalizes and the
industry benefits from increased pet ownership.

**Pet Products and Services U.S. Market Projections (dollars in billions)**

Over the next five years, the pet products market is expected to grow at approximately 5% per year (with
services catching up in 2021 and 2022), driven by: (i) continued growth in the number of pet parents (68% of U.S.
households own a pet versus 50% ten years ago); and (ii) premiumization of pet products (over the last five years
through the end of fiscal year 2019, spending per pet-owning households has grown at approximately 4% per year.
Services growth is expected to be flat in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and shut-down but continued for pet
products spend per pet-owning households which was up 3% year-over-year).

**_Leading Pet Specialty Brick and Mortar Retailer Gaining Share in Its Channel_**

The pet specialty brick and mortar channel has demonstrated resiliency as the broader retail industry has
shifted online. Although the total pet specialty brick and mortar channel has experienced a 1.0% annual decline since
2015 due to the shift to online and FDM, there has been a clear divergence of performance within the category.
Independent pet specialty players have decreased by almost 40% since 2015, while the larger pet specialty chains have
grown at 2.8% per year, with PetSmart gaining 3 points of share of the pet specialty and other brick and mortar channel.
These trends are likely to continue, as: (i) additional independent pet specialty channels are forced to close due to
performance and liquidity constraints; (ii) customers demand an increase in BOPIS and omni-channel solutions which
require significant investments and scale; (iii) larger stores offer broader product selection and cover the greatest
number of pet species; and (iv) services offerings continue to drive revenue.

**U.S. Pet Product Sales (dollars in billions) by Channel and Specialty Channel Breakdown**

Source: Packaged Facts.

PetSmart has continued to perform well despite competition from the online channel. Although Chewy, the
leading online pet retailer, increased net sales by 40% to 70% in 2018 and 2019, PetSmart achieved significant
sequential improvement in comparable sales growth during this period on a pro forma basis. In the first quarter of
2020, which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and when the brick and mortar channel might have been
expected to lose share to online competitors, despite Chewy adding approximately $200 million incremental sales
compared to the previous four quarters, PetSmart delivered its strongest merchandise comparable sales growth to date.
The same pattern repeated in the following two quarters of 2020. Despite the growth of the online channel, brick and
mortar is still expected to represent approximately 65% of pet products in 2024, which implies a future expected
growth of 1.5% to 2.0% per year within the brick and mortar channel.

**U.S. Pet Products (dollars in billions) Online vs. Brick and Mortar**

**PetSmart versus Chewy Change in Sales (Annual and Quarterly) (dollars in millions)**

As the largest player in the North American pet retail category, PetSmart has the opportunity to capture
additional market share from competitors. PetSmart’s 1,650 stores represent 15% of the total estimated 10,500 pet
specialty stores in the U.S., and they generate approximately 1.5x more sales than Petco’s stores and approximately
2.7x more revenue than those of other pet specialty chains. The COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating store closures of
smaller brick and mortar pet retail stores, providing additional market share opportunities for the larger retailers.
Further, PetSmart’s best-in-class services offerings create a flywheel effect, driving additional revenue opportunity.

PetSmart has one of the broadest suites of pet service offerings, including non-medical as well as veterinary
(through the Banfield partnership), which drive incremental sales and traffic. New investments in online bookings and
management tools, such as the PRISM scheduling system, enabling seamless booking, appointment management, and
payment processes for the customer have increased services booking capacity by approximately 15%.

Driven by strong performance, ample liquidity, consistent cash flows, a strong retail portfolio across North
America, and a unique services offering, PetSmart is well-positioned to continue to capture additional market share in
the future.

**_Services, Private Brands and Specialty Offerings Create a Competitive “Moat” and Support Leading Market_**
**_Position_**

PetSmart’s services, private brands and specialty products provide a protective “moat” against competitors,
as they are not available (or widely available) through other channels. These protective moats have a direct impact on
revenue, as 38% of the transactions in 2019 on a pro forma basis included services, private brands or specialty products.
Additionally, these unique capabilities help drive ancillary revenue, as 60% of total purchases in 2019 on a pro forma
basis were made by customers who have purchased at least one of these items.

**Services, Private Brands and Specialty Customers Create Significant Value [(1)]**

category; and “% attach outside of category” refers to percentage of customers that also make purchases outside of category.

PetSmart’s Full Suite of Service Offerings Drive Customer Traffic and Loyalty

Service offerings include: a variety of grooming services available across nearly all stores, 207 PetsHotels
available for boarding, Doggie Day camp available 7 days a week, all stages of training, and full veterinary care
offered in 809 stores primarily by the Company’s partner, Banfield. These services are a significant advantage and
differentiator versus brick and mortar competitors as none provide the same breadth and depth as PetSmart – and
importantly services cannot be offered online and thus are shielded from online competitors. In addition to the strong
base business, services customers are significantly more valuable than the overall population, spending more on
merchandise, shopping more frequently, and having a longer average tenure. Over the last 5 years through the end of
fiscal year 2019, services penetration as a percentage of overall PetSmart sales on a pro forma basis has increased
approximately 120 basis points to 12.4%.

**Value of Services Customers**

Private Brands Guarantee Exclusivity and Offer Higher Margins

PetSmart’s private brands presence generates value for the platform in two ways. First, the private brand
margins are more attractive than that of non-private brand products (and are generally priced competitively with
similar third-party brands). Second, as PetSmart’s private brands are only available in PetSmart stores, it provides a
good defensive mechanism as compared to both online and brick and mortar competitors and protects pricing given
the absence of a direct price comparison. Private brands customers are significantly more valuable than the overall
population, spending more outside of private brands, shopping more frequently, with longer overall tenure.

Over the last 5 years through the end of fiscal year 2019, PetSmart’s penetration of private brands has
increased 700 basis points to approximately 30% of merchandise, as it has introduced new selection (e.g., Tiny Tales
hamster habitats, Thrive Reptile brand) and improved upon existing brands (e.g., reformulation/rebranding of
Authority food and All Living Things small animal consumables).

**Value of Private Brand Customers**

Specialty Provides a Strong Moat against Online Competitors as Live Pets Cannot be Sold Online

The specialty category sells live animals, habitats, food, and accessories related to fish, reptiles, birds, and
small animals, and is an area of differentiation for PetSmart. As customers cannot buy live pets online, the segment is
partially insulated from e-commerce competition; beyond that, many of PetSmart’s brick and mortar competitors
cannot match PetSmart’s depth in specialty products.

This differentiation creates a stable book of business, as well as an opportunity to drive repeat business from
customers who initially buy an animal (often with a habitat and accessories), and return for various consumables (i.e.,
food, water filters, etc.). For the last twelve months ended November 1, 2020 versus the same prior year period,
PetSmart’s share of specialty has been up 407 basis points within the pet specialty channel and up 318 basis points
within brick and mortar, reaching 43.9% and 23.4%, respectively. Specialty customers tend to shop more frequently
on average than the overall population, presenting incremental upside for cross-selling opportunities. Over the last 5
years through the end of fiscal year 2019, penetration has increased approximately 130 basis points to approximately
11%.

**_Acceleration of Growth in Pre-COVID Period Following Shift of Blue Buffalo to FDM_**

PetSmart’s long term historical performance can be divided into five distinct phases:

1. **Early Growth: PetSmart experienced strong historical performance from 2007 to 2012, including growing**

through the recession and experiencing an average of approximately 4% comparable sales. This growth was
supported by an acceleration in net new store openings of approximately 95 annually from 2005 to 2008.

2. **Slowdown Pre-Investment: The Company’s growth began to slow meaningfully beginning in 2013 and**

entered negative territory in the first quarter of 2014, resulting in traffic declines – which were exacerbated
by mismanagement and a failed consumables reset.

3. **Early Investment Wins: BC Partners acquired PetSmart in 2015. As a result of cost savings and pricing**

strategies implemented by BC Partners, on a pro forma basis Adjusted EBITDA margins improved
approximately 240 basis points from 14.5% in 2014 to 16.9% in 2016, despite flat comparable sales.

4. **Channel Shifts Mid-Investment: Traffic declines began to accelerate beginning in the third quarter of 2016**

as a result of: (i) acceleration of online growth from Chewy and Amazon; and (ii) movement of two of the
largest channel-exclusive brands into the FDM space, including Blue Buffalo in 2017. As a result,
comparable sales declines reached (4.5%) in 2017. Despite these challenges, PetSmart was able to hold pro
forma Adjusted EBITDA margins at approximately 14% (i.e., pre-deal margins) through aggressive expense
management and promotion optimization strategies.

5. **Return to Positive Growth: A shift in strategy to embrace the Company’s “moats” against online as well as**

a merchandising strategy to bring in new and growing brands provided early shoots in a path to recovery.

(1) Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure; see “—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial and Other
Data” for reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure. 2018 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA excludes impact of 53[rd] week

Note: All figures are pro forma. January fiscal year-end (i.e. FY’19A corresponds to 12 month ending in Jan-2020). 2019 Sales figures
includes deferred revenue add-back of $11 million related to the start of the Treats program. 2018 Sales excludes impact of 53rd week
and includes a $20 million addback to deferred revenue related to the Treats program.

**Unpacking Comparable Sales Growth**

18


-----

PetSmart has seen continuous sequential improvement of percentage comparable sales growth in 2-year
stacked comps. In August 2017, Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula launched in Target, Kroger, Meijer and Publix
and then in April 2018 extended to Walmart which significantly impacted PetSmart’s sales in 2017 and 2018.
PetSmart’s sales from Blue Buffalo represent approximately 40% of what they used to be before the shift and its
impact on PetSmart is decreasing as (i) Blue Buffalo’s share of PetSmart’s portfolio reduces and (ii) Blue Buffalo
reaches maturity in FDM. Removing Blue Buffalo from PetSmart’s sales, which were more heavily impacted than
other retailers due to the higher portion of sales Blue Buffalo comprised, comparable sales growth returned to positive
territory in the second fiscal quarter of 2019 and improved sequentially.

Note: January fiscal year-end (i.e. fiscal year 2019 corresponds to 52 weeks ended in Jan 2020). Figures do not reflect Blue Buffalo SSS.

**_Resilient Financial Performance and Attractive Pro Forma Free Cash Flow Generation_**

PetSmart Pro Forma Cash Flow conversion has consistently been in excess of 70% historically, including
$700 million of capital expenditures invested to improve the business over the past 5 years. In addition to strong Free
Cash Flow, there will be, upon consummation of the Transactions, liquidity in the form of an undrawn ABL.
Management expects to use free cash flow to further de-lever.

**Fiscal Year 2020 YTD Update**

During the thirty-nine week period ended November 1, 2020, much of which was affected by the COVID19 pandemic, PetSmart not only benefitted from the resilience of the broader pet retail industry, but also experienced
further performance uplift that was more unique to PetSmart, driving market share gains. PetSmart’s wide assortment
offering allowed the Company to capitalize during the COVID-19 pandemic and offset a loss of services that will
rebound as the sub-category opens up. In addition, pet adoption increases during the pandemic have provided a secular
tailwind for PetSmart’s growth.

     - _Industry tailwinds: Pet supply and food retailers were deemed “essential services” during the_
government mandated shut-downs, allowing PetSmart and other similar businesses to remain open
for merchandise sales. In addition, pet adoptions and ownership increased during lockdowns,
expanding PetSmart’s customer base and generating higher demand for pet products.

     - _Competitive dynamics: Supply chain and fulfillment challenges faced by certain online competitors_
resulted in further uptick in demand for PetSmart. Strong relationships with key suppliers allowed
the Company to maintain sufficient inventory levels and satisfy the elevated demand from
customers.

     - _PetSmart actions: PetSmart took swift action to actively manage costs and drive up profitability_
through (i) optimizing its labor model, (ii) renegotiating store lease agreements and (iii) reevaluating in-store operational practices to identify long term efficiencies. In support of the top line,
the Company accelerated the roll-out of omni-channel capabilities that promoted social distancing,
namely curbside pickup, allowing customers the comfort and flexibility to shop safely.

Comparable sales in the thirteen-weeks ended May 3, 2020, August 2, 2020 and November 1, 2020 were 1.0%, 10.6%
and 13.8%, respectively, combining for 8.4% for the thirty-nine week period ended November 1, 2020. Merchandise
comparable sales for the same quarters were 6.9%, 17.6%, and 18.1%, respectively. While omni-channel penetration
has normalized down from its peak during the government mandated stay-at-home orders, by the end of the third fiscal
quarter of 2020, it remained significantly higher than pre-COVID levels. In the United States, approximately 4% of
pro forma merchandise sales in the third fiscal quarter of 2020 were through BOPIS, compared to approximately 1%
prior to COVID. Furthermore, in the thirty-nine week period ended November 1, 2020, omni-channel pro forma net
sales rose by 239% year-over-year to $360 million.

**Industry Overview**

The pet care industry serves a large, growing, and recession-resilient market. In the U.S., the pet care category
market size was approximately $95.0 billion in calendar year 2019, and included the following sub-segments: (i) pet
food ($36.6 billion); (ii) pet supplies ($18.0 billion); (iii) non-medical pet services ($10.3 billion); and (iv) veterinary
services ($30.1 billion). Approximately 56% of households in the United States owned a pet in calendar year 2020,
which equates to approximately 71 million households. In total, it is estimated that approximately 41.0% (or 51.3
million) of households owned dogs and 25.0% (or 31.4 million) of households owned cats as pets in the United States
in calendar year 2020.

**Illustrative Total Addressable Market**

22


-----

**U.S. Household Pet Ownership**

Supported by secular tailwinds, the pet care category is the fastest growing category within all of retail; the
total category has consistently grown by approximately 5% to approximately 6% in each of the last five years. Pets
are increasingly viewed as members of the family, which has helped drive relatively inelastic demand for pet care
products and services. The “premiumization” of pet food has increased customer’s ticket size, and the longer average
lives of pets has increased the number of purchases over the duration of a pet’s life. Additionally, millennials have
tended to prioritize pet ownership over having children as they enter young adulthood. Pet ownership also boasts
mental and physical health benefits, with 90% of U.S. pet parents believing that their pets have a beneficial impact on
their physical and emotional health. Researchers have tied human health benefits to pet ownership and interaction in
areas including stress, depression, anxiety and PTSD amongst others. Growth trends in pet care are expected to
continue, as the forecasted CAGR from 2019 to 2024 is approximately 5%.

**Historical Segment Growth (2017 to 2019 CAGR)**

**U.S. Pet Retail Sales (dollars in billions)**

The pet care industry has a track record of resiliency during economic downturns. During the last recession,
from 2007 to 2009, total category CAGR of approximately 6% was driven by an increase in pet ownership, partially
offset by a slight decrease in average household spending on pet products. Pet parents have consistently reduced
spending on their pets less than on themselves during recessionary event, and this trend has continued during the
COVID pandemic.

_Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the U.S. Pet Industry_

The pet industry has historically proven to be recession-resilient. However, projected U.S. pet retail sales are
expected to decline by 1.2% in 2020 – compared with 5% growth forecasted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic –
resulting in a decrease from $95 billion in 2019 to $94 billion projected in 2020. This forecast factors in sales declines
in 2020 for services which have been impacted by stay-at home and social distancing orders, with the largest decline

24


-----

expected for non-medical pet services. The decline in services was partially offset by an increase in pet food and pet
products, driven by an increase in pet ownership.

Pet product sales are expected to be up 7.7% in 2020 due to increased pet ownership rates – reflecting overall
resilience in the category, partially impacted by some level of trading down to value and store brands. Pet adoption
rates have increased through the COVID-19 pandemic as the U.S. population has turned to pets to support mental and
physical well-being during periods of self-isolation. In the United States, the approximately 4% projected growth in
pet ownership households in 2020 would increase the number of pet-owning households in the U.S. to nearly 71
million by year-end.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the pet industry is expected to rebound to pre-pandemic
levels and accelerate with tailwinds created by the increased pet adoption rates during the lock-down period. These
factors contribute to the attractiveness of the growing pet care category, of which PetSmart is the only comprehensive
provider of both pet products and services in the United States.

**Optional Redemption ........** We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to    , 2024 at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a “makewhole premium,” as described under “Description of Notes—Optional

Holders—Change of Control” and “Description of Senior Unsecured Notes—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

We may not be able to pay you the required price for notes you present to us at the
time of a change of control, because:

               - we may not have enough funds at that time; or

               - the terms of our indebtedness under the new senior secured credit facilities
may prevent us from making such payment.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not
be able to purchase the notes upon a Change of Control, which would result in a
default under the indentures that will govern the notes and would materially
adversely affect our business and financial condition.”

**Certain Covenants .............** The indentures that will govern each series of notes will contain covenants that will
limit the Issuers’ ability and the ability of the Issuers’ restricted subsidiaries to:

               - incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;

               - incur liens or use assets as security in other transactions;

substantially all of our assets.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications as described

Fitch Inc. (“Fitch”) and no event of default with respect to such series of notes has
occurred and is continuing. See “Description of Senior First Lien Notes—Certain

**Transfer Restrictions;**
**No Registration Rights ......** The notes and the note guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act
or any state or other securities laws, and we are under no obligation to so register
the notes. The notes will be subject to restrictions on transfer and may not be offered
or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. Further, you may offer or sell the
notes only to an investor who is a “qualified purchaser” as defined in Section
2(a)(51) of the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder for purposes of
Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act and who is also either a “qualified
institutional buyer” or a non-U.S. person. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We do not
intend to list the notes on any securities exchange. We do not intend to issue
registered notes and note guarantees in exchange for the notes and the note
guarantees to be placed in this offering, and the absence of registration rights may
adversely impact the transferability of the notes. See “Notice to Investors” and
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Holders of the
notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to
register the notes under applicable securities laws.”

If any person acquiring notes (or a beneficial interest therein) is not a qualified
purchaser who is also either a qualified institutional buyer or a non-U.S. person at
the time of acquisition thereof, the Issuer may regard the transaction as null and
void and of no effect. If any person acquiring a note (or a beneficial interest therein)
is not a qualified purchaser at the time of acquiring such Security, the transaction
will be null and void and of no effect. In such circumstances, such person may be
forced to transfer or sell such notes to a permitted transferee meeting the
requirements set forth under “Transfer Restrictions—Purchaser Representations
and Warranties.” There are additional restrictions on your ability to transfer and
resell the notes without registration under applicable securities laws.

**No Prior Market ................** Each series of notes is a new issue of securities for which there is currently no
market. Although the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to make
a market in each series of notes, they are not obligated to do so, and they may
discontinue market making activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we
cannot assure you that a liquid market for the notes will develop or, if such a market
develops, that it will be maintained.

agents under our existing ABL facility, new ABL facility, and new term loan
facility and have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and
commissions for transactions under such facilities. See “Plan of Distribution.” This
offering memorandum shall not constitute a notice of redemption with respect to
any series of notes or a notice of repayment with respect to the existing term loan
facility, and any redemption of our existing notes will be made in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the relevant indenture.

upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The pro
forma financial data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what our financial
condition or our results of operations would have been had the Transactions occurred on or as of the dates noted above
or to project the results of operations or financial condition for any future date or period. The pro forma financial data
has been derived from the unaudited pro forma financial information set forth in “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information of PetSmart”.

The summary historical consolidated financial data set forth below should be read in conjunction with
“Selected Historical Financial and Other Data”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations”, “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information of PetSmart” and the financial statements of
PetSmart and its subsidiaries and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Chewy
summary historical financial information is reflected in the historical figures set forth below.

For historical periods, Chewy is consolidated in PetSmart’s audited and unaudited financial statements. We
have included herein certain financial information with respect to Chewy on a standalone basis, including summary
financial information as of and for the twelve-months ended November 1, 2020 under “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial

(a) Chewy includes a portion of the online pet pharmacy activity of Chewy.com that legally resides within a wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. (the
“Pharmacy Subsidiary”) outside of Chewy. We have combined the financial results of the Pharmacy Subsidiary with the financial results of Chewy since
Chewy operates the entire online pet pharmacy business of Chewy.com, including the Pharmacy Subsidiary and the Pharmacy Subsidiary will be
distributed or otherwise transferred pursuant to the Chewy Distribution substantially concurrently with or at any time following consummation of the
other Transactions. This column also represents Chewy and the Pharmacy Subsidiary under PetSmart’s accounting and reporting policies.
(b) “Other revenue” included in net sales primarily represents sublease income, reimbursements for specific operating expenses charged to third-party
veterinary offices located within many of our stores under our agreements with them, and beginning in 2019, gift card breakage.

(5) “Other revenue” included in net sales primarily represents sublease income, reimbursements for specific operating
expenses charged to third-party veterinary offices located within many of our stores under our agreements with them,
and beginning in 2019, gift card breakage.

(6) We define EBITDA as net income, plus income tax expense, interest expense, net and depreciation and amortization. We
define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, as further adjusted to exclude certain adjustment items. We describe these
adjustments reconciling net income to Adjusted EBITDA in the table below. The indentures that will govern the notes
and the credit agreements that will govern the new senior secured credit facilities will permit us to make all of the above
adjustments in calculating “EBITDA” as defined in and pursuant to such agreements and may permit us to exclude other
charges and expenses and make other or different adjustments in calculating “EBITDA” as defined in and pursuant to
such agreements in future periods. Certain of the material covenants in the indentures that will govern the notes and the
credit agreements that govern the new senior secured credit facilities are described in “Description of Other
Indebtedness,” “Description of Senior First Lien Notes” and “Description of Senior Unsecured Notes.”

We define Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA, less capital expenditures and cash payment for finance leases
(comprised of finance lease obligation payments and related interest).

We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow because we believe that investors consider them to be
important supplemental measures of our performance and believe these measures are frequently used by securities
analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not required by, and are not presented in accordance with, GAAP. The items excluded
from EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are significant in assessing our operating results and liquidity.

Our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in
isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

     - they do not reflect costs or cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

     - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

     - they do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments
on our debt;

     - they do not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;

     - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our
ongoing operations;

     - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often
have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such
replacements; and

38


-----

     - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as
comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as measures
of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or to reduce indebtedness. See “Non-GAAP Financial
Measures.”

We present Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma
Free Cash Flow as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Free Cash Flow, in each case, further
adjusted for (i) the Chewy Distribution and (ii) in the case of the twelve-months ended November 1, 2020, the

Below is a reconciliation of net income to Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Free Cash Flow for the historical fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, the thirty-nine

**RISK FACTORS**

_Investing in the notes involves risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as_
_the other information included in this offering memorandum, before deciding to purchase any notes. The risks_
_described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or_
_that we currently deem to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a_
_material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In such a case, you_
_may lose all or part of your investment in the notes._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Uncertainties in economic conditions, including those caused by the impact of the novel coronavirus known as_**
**_COVID-19, and any related impact on consumer spending on pet products and services, could adversely impact_**
**_our business and results of operations._**

The outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and continues
to spread in the United States, Canada, and in many other countries globally. Related government responsive actions
have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect our business operations. It is impossible to predict the
effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the pandemic remains ongoing. The COVID-19 pandemic
has disrupted the global supply chain, including some of our suppliers, and has caused and may continue to cause
disruptions to our operations. While the sale of pet food and supplies has generally been viewed as essential business
throughout the pandemic, pet related services have sometimes been classified by state and local authorities as nonessential business requiring us to temporarily halt or limit our services offerings and social distancing guidelines have
continued to negatively impact our services business. Any worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any future
actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by federal, state or local authorities, including those that limit the
operation of our stores, grooming salons and other services or otherwise limit the ability of our associates to work in
our stores, distribution centers, or other locations, could result in partial or complete closures for unknown duration in
certain jurisdictions, which would adversely impact our business and results of operations.

We temporarily reduced our hours of operations in April for all of our stores; however, during the thirteen
weeks ended August 2, 2020, we began adding back these hours with most of our stores returning to normal hours of
operations as of November 1, 2020. Beginning on April 5, 2020, approximately half of our Canadian stores were only
open for online orders shipped from stores and curbside pickup. On May 19, 2020, these Canadian stores reopened
for in-store transactions. These stores were again limited to online orders shipped from stores and curbside pickup
beginning on December 26, 2020 under an order that remains in place as of the date hereof. In addition, effective
March 21, 2020, we elected to temporarily suspend all grooming services for approximately two weeks in response to
the pandemic. After this period, and following an evaluation of our grooming business and several changes to our
processes, we began to reopen our grooming operations where allowable under state and local orders. As of
November 1, 2020, nearly all of our grooming salons had reopened, however, a small percentage have been required
to close under local orders, mostly in California and Canada, since that time. Our pet training services were closed
from the start of the pandemic until June 8, 2020 when these services began to reopen where allowable under state
and local orders. However, class sizes were reduced to allow for social distancing. As of November 1, 2020, pet
training services had resumed in most of our stores. Substantially all of our PetsHotels were closed from the start of
the pandemic through May 20, 2020 when these services began to reopen where allowable under state and local orders
and in markets with sufficient demand. The majority of PetsHotels had re-opened as of November 1, 2020. The
Company may in the future experience similar closures, reduction in hours of operations, suspension of services and
PetsHotel closures as a result of any worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our personnel are working remotely and it is
possible that this could have a negative impact on the execution of our business plans and operations. If a natural
disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our associates ability to work
remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of
time. The increase in remote working may also result in consumer privacy, IT security and fraud concerns.

We continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our operations as may
be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates,

customers, suppliers, vendors and the overall business. The uncertainty around the duration of business disruptions,
including uncertainty around consumer demand, and the extent of the spread of the virus in the United States and to
other areas of the world will likely continue to adversely impact the national or global economy and negatively impact
consumer spending. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,
operating results and ability to execute and capitalize on our strategies. The full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s
impact on our operations and financial performance depends on future developments that are uncertain and
unpredictable, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its impact on capital and financial markets and any
new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, information regarding the virus and pets, its
spread to other regions as well as the actions taken to contain it, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic could
adversely affect our business operations, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply
chain operations and financial results for a period of time that is currently unknown. The impact of the COVID-19
pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this offering memorandum.

**_A decline in consumer spending, an inability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences with_**
**_respect to product and services offerings and customer experience, or failure to successfully manage and execute_**
**_our marketing initiatives could reduce our sales or profitability and harm our business._**

Our sales depend on consumer spending, which is influenced by factors beyond our control, including general
economic conditions, the availability of discretionary income and credit, consumer confidence, tax or interest rate
fluctuations, fuel and other energy costs, healthcare costs, weather, and unemployment levels. Global or national
political unrest or uncertainty may also impact the price paid by consumers for goods, services and commodities and
reduce consumer spending and confidence, and reduce our sales or profitability. We may experience declines in sales
or changes in the types of products and services sold during economic downturns. Any material decline in the amount
of consumer spending could reduce our sales, and a decrease in the sales of higher-margin products and services could
reduce profitability and, in each case, harm our business.

The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in
demographics and consumer preferences, and thereby cultivate a growing, loyal customer base, improve customer
traffic, and increase the average transaction amount. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing
consumer tastes and preferences with respect to product and services offerings and customer experience, spending
patterns, and pet ownership trends and pet care needs could adversely affect our business and financial results. In
addition, our business depends in part on the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives. We may not be able to
successfully execute such initiatives to realize the intended benefits and growth prospects due to factors outside of our
control, such as increased competition or deterioration of general economic conditions, thus limiting our ability to
capitalize on business opportunities and expand our business. Also, if we are unable to accurately predict our
customers’ preferred method of communication or their acceptance of our marketing initiatives, we could fail to drive
sales growth, thereby impacting our business and financial performance.

**_The pet products and services retail industry is very competitive and continued competitive forces may adversely_**
**_impact our business and financial results._**

The pet products and services retail industry is very competitive. We compete with supermarkets, warehouse
clubs and other mass and general retailers, many of which are larger and have significantly greater resources than we
have. We also compete with a number of specialty pet supply stores, grocery stores, farm and feed stores, veterinarians,
independent grooming, boarding, and training service providers, catalog retailers and e-commerce retailers. See
“Business—Competition.” The pet products and services retail industry has become increasingly competitive due to
the expansion of pet-related product offerings by certain supermarkets, warehouse clubs and other mass and general
retailers, and the entrance of other specialty retailers into the pet food and pet supply market, some of which have
developed store formats similar to ours. We may face greater competition from these or other retailers in the future,
and changes in their merchandising and operational strategies could impact our sales and profitability. In particular, if
supermarket, warehouse club or other mass and retail merchandise competitors seek to gain or retain market share by
reducing prices, we may reduce our prices on similar product offerings in order to remain competitive, which may
result in a decrease in our market share, sales, operating results and profitability and require a change in our operating
strategies.

43


-----

We also have been able to compete successfully by differentiating ourselves from our competitors through
providing a careful combination of merchandise assortment, competitive pricing, service offerings and unique
customer experience. If changes in consumer preferences decrease the competitive advantage attributable to these
factors, or if we fail to otherwise positively differentiate our customer experience from our competitors, our business
and results of operations could be adversely affected. In particular, a key component of our business strategy is to rely
on our reputation for exceptional customer service. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring, training, and retaining
associates who share our core values of delivering superior service to our customers and caring about pet parents and
their needs. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our associates, by our inability to conduct our
operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to maintain
our current levels of customer service and our reputation for customer service as we grow or otherwise, our net sales
may not continue to grow or may decline, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be
materially and adversely affected.

We expect competition in the pet products and services retail industry, in particular Internet-based
competition, generally to continue to increase. If we fail to compete successfully and acquire new customers or retain
existing customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected.

**_We may be unable to continue to open new stores and enter new markets successfully. If we are unable to_**
**_successfully refurbish existing stores and open new stores, our results of operations could be harmed, and_**
**_comparable sales at our existing stores may decrease due to age or the impact of opening new stores in the same_**
**_area, which could adversely impact our results of operations._**

We currently operate stores in most of the major market areas of the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada.
Our ability to be successful with our store development efforts is dependent on various factors, some of which are
outside our control, including:

  - identifying store sites that offer attractive returns on our investment notwithstanding the impact of
cannibalization of our existing stores;

  - competition for those sites;

  - successfully negotiating with landlords to achieve acceptable lease terms and obtaining any necessary
governmental, regulatory or private approvals;

  - construction costs and/or building material costs;

  - timely construction or remodels of stores;

  - our ability to attract and retain qualified store personnel; and

  - our ability to timely refurbish existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our
investment.

To the extent we are unable to accomplish any of the above, our ability to open new stores or refurbish
existing ones may be harmed and our future sales and profits may be adversely affected. In addition, we can make no
assurances that we will be able to meet the forecasted level of sales or new store openings or operate our new stores
or PetsHotels profitably.

As a result of new store openings in existing markets, and because older stores will represent an increasing
proportion of our store base over time, our comparable sales performance may be materially impacted in future
periods. In addition, opening new stores in a market will attract some customers away from other stores already
operated by us in that market and diminish their sales.

44


-----

Our leases are typically signed approximately nine to twelve months before a store opens. As a result, we
may be unable to timely adjust our store opening schedule to new economic conditions or a change in strategy.

**_A disruption, malfunction or increased costs in the operation of our supply chain due to serious disruptions could_**
**_impact our ability to manage our inventory, deliver products to our stores or leverage our expenses. Our inability_**
**_to successfully manage inventory levels could lead to excess inventory or inventory shortages, which could harm_**
**_our sales and results of operations._**

Our vendors generally ship merchandise to our distribution centers, which then allocate the merchandise to
our stores or third-party fulfilment sites. Any interruption or malfunction in our distribution operations, including, but
not limited to, disruptions to the transportation infrastructure, disruptions caused by geopolitical events, such as war
or civil unrest in a country in which our vendors are located, or terrorist or military activities that disrupt transportation,
communication, or utility systems, local protests, and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods,
earthquakes, and other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, other
catastrophic events, disease (such as COVID-19), port or other strikes, contamination or trade barriers, the loss of a
key vendor that provides transportation of merchandise within our distribution network, the failure of a key vendor to
deliver on its commitments, or a material increase in our transportation and distribution costs, including, but not
limited to, costs resulting from increases in the price of fuel and other energy costs or other commodities, could cause
inventory shortages and harm our sales and results of operations, particularly during peak periods.

We seek to optimize inventory levels to operate our business successfully. Nonetheless, we are exposed to
inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, vendor
reliability, changes in customer preferences or demand, and changes in consumer spending patterns with respect to
our products. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid over or under stocking products that we sell.
Demand for products, however, can change between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale and we may be
unable to accurately forecast such changes. Any of the events above could result in out-of-stock or excess merchandise
inventory levels requiring markdowns that could harm our sales and the results of operations.

We operate fish distribution centers within certain of our distribution centers. Operating the fish distribution
centers is a very complex process involving the intake and sorting of hundreds of different species of fish, housing,
feeding and caring for the fish within an integrated tanks system until shipment, and safely shipping live fish directly
to stores. An interruption or malfunction in these operations or in the fulfillment of fish orders could result in the loss
of live fish or harm our sales and results of operations.

**_If our information systems fail to perform as designed or are interrupted for a significant period of time, our_**
**_business could be harmed._**

The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. In particular, we rely on our
information systems to effectively manage our financial and operational data, process payroll, manage the supply
chain, maintain our in-stock positions, process customer transactions, and operate our services business. We possess
disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities for our key information systems and take measures intended to
prevent security breaches, unauthorized intrusions and computer viruses. However, these capabilities and measures
may not be effective, and the failure of our information systems to perform as designed due to failure to manage
disasters, security breaches, computer viruses or any other intrusion or interruption of our information systems for a
significant period of time could significantly disrupt our business.

We continue to invest in our information systems. Enhancing or replacing our major financial or operational
information systems could result in disruption of normal operating processes and procedures and have a significant
impact on our ability to conduct our core business operations. We can make no assurances that enhancing or replacing
our information systems will remain within estimated costs, that the systems will be implemented without material
disruption, or that the systems will be as beneficial as predicted. If our predictions or estimates are inaccurate, the
results of our operations could be harmed.

-----

**_We are subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks. If we fail_**
**_to protect the integrity and security of customer and associate information, our business could be adversely_**
**_impacted._**

Our business employs systems and websites designed for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary
or confidential information regarding our customers, associates, suppliers and others, including personal identification
information. For instance, we receive, retain and transmit certain sensitive personal information that our customers
provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty program
or register on our websites or mobile application, or otherwise communicate to us. The increasing costs associated
with the implementation and on-going operation of our information security systems, such as increased investments
in technology (including data privacy and data security technology), and the costs of compliance with privacy and
information security laws, policies and standards could adversely impact our business.

Security breaches and similar incidents could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information,
litigation and potential liability, require us to expend additional resources related to the security of information
systems, divert the attention of our management and disrupt our business. As the techniques used to obtain
unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately
produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these attacks or to implement adequate preventative or
remedial measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure,
damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our business. We may not have the resources or
technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly-evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at
us, our customers and suppliers, or others who have entrusted us with information or who are storing information
entrusted with us. Actual, suspected or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to
deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train associates, and engage third-party experts and
consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in
the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and
security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom
we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information.

Our websites, which are increasingly important to our business, and the computer systems and operating
systems on which they run may also be subject to cyber-attacks or intrusions. Those attacks could involve attempts to
gain access to our websites to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers’ or members’ payment information and
related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, can also create denials of service or otherwise disable,
degrade or sabotage one or more of our websites and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers’ and members’
shopping experience on any of our websites. If we are unable to maintain the security of our websites and keep them
operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and
deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for the same, including for any damage to customers whose
personal information is unlawfully obtained, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business
and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.

A compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with that results in information
related to our customers, associates or business being obtained by unauthorized persons could disrupt our operations,
harm our brand and reputation, result in a loss of consumer confidence in us, and expose us to regulatory actions and
claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations, government entities and other persons, any
of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may incur
significant costs and operational consequences in connection with investigating, mitigating, remediating, eliminating
and putting in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent future actual or perceived security incidents, as
well as in connection with complying with any notification or other obligations resulting from any security incidents.
Because we do not control our third-party vendors, or the processing of data by our third-party vendors, our ability to
monitor our third-party vendors’ data security is limited and we cannot ensure the integrity or security of the measures
they take to protect and prevent the loss of our or our consumers’ data. As a result, we are subject to the risk that
cyber-attacks on, or other security incidents affecting, our third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even
if an attack or breach does not directly impact our systems.

**_Failure to comply with international, federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection,_**

-----

**_relating to privacy, data protection, advertising and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business,_**
**_financial condition, and results of operations._**

We rely on a variety of marketing techniques, including email and social media marketing and postal
mailings, and we are subject to various laws and regulations that govern such marketing and advertising practices. A
variety of international, federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and
security of consumer data, particularly in the context of online advertising which we rely upon to attract new
customers.

Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, marketing and advertising, and consumer protection
are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may be interpreted and applied in
a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a
result, our practices may not have complied or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations,
requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or
with any international, federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry selfregulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject
or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation, brand and
business, and may result in claims, liabilities, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, customers,
suppliers or others, or may require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain data sets. Any such claims,
proceedings or actions could hurt our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense
of such proceedings or actions, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of
customers and suppliers and result in the imposition of monetary penalties. We may also be contractually required to
indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws,
regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized
use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.

Federal and state governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use
of third-party “cookies” and other methods of online tracking for behavioral advertising and other purposes. The U.S.
government has enacted, has considered or is considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict the
ability of companies and individuals to engage in these activities, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice
and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools or the use of data
gathered with such tools. Additionally, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or
announced plans to implement, means to make it easier for Internet users to prevent the placement of cookies or to
block other tracking technologies, which could if widely adopted result in the use of third-party cookies and other
methods of online tracking becoming significantly less effective. The regulation of the use of these cookies and other
current online tracking and advertising practices or a loss in our ability to make effective use of services that employ
such technologies could increase our costs of operations and limit our ability to acquire new customers on costeffective terms and consequently, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

In addition, various international, federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory
organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance
regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, and advertising. For example, in June, 2018 the State of
California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which became effective on January
1, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make
new disclosures to individuals about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows individuals to opt out of
certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. In addition, laws in all 50
U.S. states require businesses to provide notice to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a
result of a data breach. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting
federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and
security of data. Each of these privacy, security, and data protection laws and regulations, and any other such changes
or new laws or regulations, could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, impose fines and
other penalties or restrict our use or storage of personal information, which may increase our compliance expenses
and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct. Any such changes could compromise our ability to
develop an adequate marketing strategy and pursue our growth strategy effectively, which, in turn, could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_The disruption of the relationship with or the loss of any of our key vendors or third-party service providers, in_**
**_particular any vendors or service providers with whom we have exclusive relationships, a decision by our vendors_**
**_to make their products available in supermarkets or through warehouse clubs and other mass and general retailers,_**
**_the inability of our vendors to provide quality products in a timely or cost-effective manner, or risks associated with_**
**_the suppliers from whom products are sourced, could harm our business._**

We offer a differentiated product assortment. If more pet food or pet supply vendors were to make their
products available in supermarkets, warehouse clubs and other mass or general retailers, our business could be harmed.
In addition, if the grocery brands currently available to such retailers were to gain market share at the expense of the
differentiated brands sold through specialty pet food and pet supply outlets, our business could be harmed.

We purchase a substantial amount of pet supplies from a number of vendors with limited supply capabilities,
and a small number of our largest vendors account for a material amount of products sold. We can make no assurances
that we will be able to find new qualified vendors who meet our standards, or that our current pet supply vendors will
be able to accommodate our anticipated needs or comply with new or existing regulatory requirements. Further, the
COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause, some of our supplies to experience delays, which could
adversely impact our business. If increases in consumer demand outpace our ability to supply products, we may fail
to exploit market opportunity, which could harm our business. In addition, we purchase a substantial amount of our
private-branded pet supplies from vendors outside of the United States. Effective global sourcing of many of the
products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We can make no assurances that our international
vendors will be able to satisfy our requirements including, but not limited to, timeliness of delivery, acceptable product
quality and accurate packaging and labeling. Any inability of our existing vendors to provide products meeting such
requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner could harm our business. In addition, we have no material long-term
supply commitments from our vendors and any vendor could discontinue selling to us at any time.

Many factors relating to our vendors and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control,
including the stability of their political, economic and financial environments, their abilities to operate in challenging
economic environments or meet our standards and applicable U.S. and local legal requirements, the availability of
labor and raw materials, natural disasters and epidemics, labor unrest, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange
rates, trade restrictions, transport availability and cost, inflation and other factors. For example, in addition to the
potential direct effects on us of COVID-19 or any similar epidemic or pandemic, we could be materially adversely
impacted from any disruption to critical vendor services or losses of business, if any of our suppliers face significant
business disruptions as a result of COVID-19 or any similar outbreak. We have suppliers around the world, including
in China, the U.S. and other countries where cases of COVID-19 have been reported and may be spreading in the
community. If the spread of COVID-19 were to worsen in the U.S. or in any other country or region where we have a
significant employee presence, facilities or critical operations, it could impair our ability to manage day-to-day
operations and service our customers, increase our costs of operations and also result in, among other things, losses
of revenue.

In addition, Canadian and U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade
sanctions imposed on certain countries, limitations on the import of certain types of goods or of goods containing
certain materials from other countries, and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. For example,
certain policies and statements of the President of the U.S. and senior administration officials have given rise to
uncertainty regarding the future of international trade agreements and the U.S.’ position on international trade. The
U.S. government has previously raised tariffs, and imposed new tariffs, on a wide range of imports of Chinese products.
The U.S. federal government may also withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements. Additional
trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions, could increase could lead
to additional costs, delays in shipments, embargos and other uncertainties that could negatively impact our
relationships with our international vendors, our access to products, our operations and financial performance.

We also use and rely on services from third parties, such as fulfillment & transportation services providers
and credit card processors, financial management services providers, supply chain services providers and data storage
services providers. If any of these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions or because
they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices, or for any other reason, our expenses could
increase and our processes for managing sales of our offerings and supporting our customers could be impaired, any
of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Fluctuations in the prices and availability of certain commodities, such as rawhide, grains, and meat protein, could_**
**_materially adversely affect our operating results._**

The pet food and supplies industry is subject to risks related to increases in the price of and the availability
of certain commodities used in the production of certain pet food and other pet-related products, specifically seed,
wheat, and rice, as well as other materials such as rawhide, that are used in certain pet accessories. Additionally,
increased human consumption or population increases may potentially limit the supply of or increase prices for certain
of meat proteins used in animal feed. In general, in circumstances where these price increases have resulted in our
manufacturers or vendors increasing the costs we pay for our food products, we have been able to pass these increases
on to customers. However, our ability to pass on increased purchase costs in the future will be significantly impacted
by market conditions and competitive factors. If we are unable to pass on any increased purchase costs to customers,
we may experience reduced margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

**_Our expanded offering of private-branded products may not improve our financial performance and may expose_**
**_us to product liability and other claims._**

We offer various private-branded products, for which we rely on third-party manufacturers. Such third-party
manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, or the quality of the products may not meet our expectations. In such events,
we may have increased exposure for quality-related claims or losses caused by such products. We also may suffer
reputational harm if our manufacturers fail to adhere to the standards set forth in our supplier code of conduct which
sets forth labor standards and other responsible business practices. In addition, our private-branded products compete
with other manufacturers’ branded items that we offer. As we continue to evaluate the number and types of privatebranded products that we sell, we may adversely affect our relationships with our vendors who may decide to reduce
their product offerings through us and increase their product offerings through our competitors. An increase in our
private-branded product offerings also exposes us to risk that third parties will assert infringement, misappropriation
or other violation claims against us with respect to such products, and we may be unable to fully protect our intellectual
property rights on our private-branded products. Finally, if any of our customers are harmed by our private-branded
products, they may bring product liability and other claims against us. Any of these circumstances could have an
adverse effect on our business and financial performance.

**_Pet food and product safety, quality, health and environmental concerns could affect our business._**

We could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the pet food and
other products we sell. All of our vendors are required to comply with applicable food and product safety laws, and
we are dependent upon them to ensure such compliance. Failure to adhere to quality standards may cause inventory
shortages and adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether valid or not, may discourage consumers from
buying the products in our stores. The sale of pet food or other products that do not meet applicable safety standards
by us could result in product liability claims against our vendors or us, expose us or our vendors to governmental
enforcement action or private litigation, or lead to costly recalls and a loss of consumer confidence, any of which
could have an adverse effect on our sales, operations and financial performance.

Further, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and
safety matters, including those governing the management and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of contaminated
sites. We could incur costs, including fines and other sanctions, cleanup costs, and third-party claims, as a result of
violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, changes in product safety laws or
regulations, including environmental regulations, could increase costs and have an adverse effect on our business.

**_Negative publicity arising from claims that we or our vendors do not properly care for animals we sell or that are_**
**_in our care could adversely affect our brand or result in a loss of consumer confidence, either of which could_**
**_reduce our sales and profitability._**

We provide a broad array of pet services, including grooming and training in all of our stores, and boarding
and day camp services in approximately 207 PetsHotels. We also sell a wide variety of small pets, including birds,
fish, reptiles and other small animals. From time to time we are subject to claims or complaints that we or any of our
vendors have not properly cared for a pet receiving one of our services offerings, or for an animal we sell. Given the

49


-----

large number of animals in our stores and PetsHotels each day, deaths or injuries sometimes occur while they are in
our care. As a result, we may be subject to claims that our animal care practices, or the related training of our associates,
may not provide the proper level of care. Any such claims or complaints, as well as any related news reports, could
cause negative publicity, which in turn could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

**_Our inability to attract, train and retain qualified leaders and associates could harm our business._**

Our success is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train, manage and retain a strong management team
and quality store and distribution center associates, including skilled store managers and qualified services personnel
such as pet trainers and groomers. There is a high level of competition for these employees, particularly in areas where
certain of our distribution centers are located which are experiencing a shortage of qualified personnel. Our ability to
operate our stores and expand our services depends on our ability to attract and retain these personnel. Competition
for qualified store management and services personnel could require us to pay higher wages or other compensation to
attract a sufficient number of associates. Turnover, which has historically been high among entry-level or part-time
associates at our stores and distribution centers, increases the risk that associates will not have the training and
experience needed to provide competitive, high-quality customer service. Our ability to meet our labor needs while
controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including unemployment levels, prevailing wage
rates, changing demographics and changes in employment legislation. If we are unable to retain qualified associates
or our labor costs increase significantly, our business operations and financial performance could be adversely
impacted.

**_Our international operations may result in additional market risks, which may harm our business._**

We operate stores outside of the United States and source many of our products internationally. As these
operations grow, they may require greater management and financial resources. International operations require the
integration of personnel with varying cultural and business backgrounds and an understanding of the relevant
differences in the cultural, legal and regulatory environments. Our results may be increasingly affected by the risks of
our international activities, including:

    - fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

    - changes in international staffing and employment issues or laws;

    - tariff and other trade barriers;

    - greater difficulty in establishing, utilizing and enforcing our intellectual property rights;

    - failure to understand the local culture and market;

    - the burden of complying with foreign laws, including tax laws, and financial accounting and
reporting standards; and

    - political and economic instability and developments.

**_Our business may be harmed if the operation of veterinary hospitals at our stores is limited or fails to continue._**

As of November 1, 2020 and February 2, 2020, we had full-service veterinary hospitals in 809 and 848 of
our stores, respectively, of which 799 and 839, respectively, were operated by Medical Management International,
Inc., which does business as Banfield, The Pet Hospital. Our business may be adversely impacted if Banfield were to
reduce hours of operations, change service offerings, or elect to discontinue operations.

In addition, we and the third-party operators of our veterinary hospitals are subject to statutes and regulations
in various states, territories and provinces regulating the ownership of veterinary practices or the operation of
veterinary hospitals in stores that may impact our ability to host, or such other third party’s ability to operate, veterinary
hospitals within our facilities. A determination that we or such other third party are in violation of any of these

50


-----

applicable statutes and regulations could require us or such third party to restructure our or their operations to comply,
or render us or such other third party unable to operate veterinary hospitals in a given location. We can make no
assurances that we could contract with another third party to operate the veterinary hospitals on favorable terms, if at
all, or that we could successfully operate the veterinary hospitals ourselves.

**_We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales._**

Our financial results, including our net sales and our comparable sales, have fluctuated. A variety of factors
affect our comparable sales, including competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the
release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing
programs, the success of our buy-online, pick-up-in-store program and our ship-to-home program, timing and level of
markdowns and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales to differ materially from prior
periods and from our expectations.

**_If we are unsuccessful in growing and managing our omni-channel capabilities, our market position, net sales and_**
**_financial performance may be materially and adversely affected._**

We have and continue to invest in our omni-channel offerings and will rely to a greater extent on increasing
omni-channel sales for growth. Our investments in omni-channel capabilities and technology may not be adequate or
effective, and we may fail to grow our omni-channel sales. If we are unsuccessful in implementing our strategy, our
market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, the cost of investments
in growing our omni-channel business may adversely impact our financial performance.

**_We are subject to risks related to online payment methods._**

We currently accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, PayPal and gift
cards. As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance
requirements, fraud and other risks. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other fees, which may
increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We are also subject to payment card
association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or
impossible for us to comply.

Furthermore, as our business changes, we may be subject to different rules under existing standards, which
may require new assessments that involve costs above what we currently pay for compliance. In the future, as we offer
new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud.
If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the volume of
fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we currently accept, or if a data breach
occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and
may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card payments from consumers or facilitate other
types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We also occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent data. If we are unable to detect or control fraud,
our liability for these transactions could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop or book services with us online do not_**
**_function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our business, could be materially adversely_**
**_affected._**

Many of our customers shop or book services with us through our existing websites and mobile apps.
Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets and smart phones to engage with us. We must anticipate and meet
our customers’ changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our
competitors’ operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless customer experience. Any failure
on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly and secure technology platforms that offer a wide assortment of

51


-----

merchandise at competitive prices and services bookings in a manner that meets the changing expectations of online
shoppers and developments in online merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive
disadvantage, result in the loss of sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the
growth of our business and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

**_Risks and costs associated with our leasehold property portfolio and our inability to obtain financing could have a_**
**_negative impact on our cash flow required to fund our planned operations and execute on our growth strategy._**

To fund our currently planned operations and execute on growth initiatives, we will need significant amounts
of cash from operations, including funds to pay our lease obligations, remodel and build out new store, purchase
inventory, pay personnel and further invest in our infrastructure and facilities. In particular, payments under the
operating leases associated with our stores and our distribution facilities account for a significant portion of our
operating expenses. Our leases generally have a term of 10 to 20 years and our ability to close stores or make other
changes to our store fleet are limited by the terms of our existing leases.

Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:

    - requiring that a substantial portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations,
thus reducing cash available for other purposes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in
which we compete; and

    - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing.

Any of these consequences could place us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors. We depend on
cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not
generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund these activities or we experience working capital leverage
deterioration, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us under the new ABL facility, we may need
additional equity or debt financing. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, our ability to run and
expand our business or to respond to competitive pressures would be limited and we could be required to delay,
significantly curtail or eliminate planned investments to grow our business.

**_Failure to successfully integrate any business we acquire could have an adverse impact on our financial results._**

From time to time, we acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business. Acquisitions may
result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our
management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfully integrate
operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating
procedures. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, we could experience increased costs associated with
operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Also, while we employ several
different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities, the new businesses may not meet or exceed our
expectations, and therefore, affect our financial performance.

**_Failure to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights could have a_**
**_negative impact on our operating results._**

Our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, domain names and other intellectual
property and proprietary rights are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized use or reproduction
or other misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could diminish the value of our brands or
goodwill and cause a decline in our revenue or operating results. The actions we have taken to establish and protect
our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequate and we may need to resort to litigation in the
future to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs

52


-----

and a diversion of resources and may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated. In addition, protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights outside the United States
could be time-consuming and costly, and the local laws and regulations outside the United States may not fully protect
our rights in such intellectual property and proprietary rights. If we are unable to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce
our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including our private brands, we could suffer a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be subject to claims from third parties that we are infringing on, misappropriating or otherwise violating_**
**_their intellectual property or proprietary rights._**

We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding
alleged infringement, misappropriation or other violation by us of the intellectual property and other proprietary rights
of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and
managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of substantial damages as well as litigation costs. Any
payments we are required to make and any injunctions we are required to comply with as a result of such actions could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may need to obtain licenses from, or
enter into royalty arrangements with, third parties who allege that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated their rights, but such licenses or arrangements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. In
addition, we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with
respect to intellectual property or proprietary rights we do not own. These risks have been amplified by the increase
in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.

**_Changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could adversely affect our_**
**_business._**

Laws and regulations at the local, regional, state, federal and international levels change frequently and the
changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors. Any changes
in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affects our
business, including those related to labor and employment (including minimum wage requirements, overtime, terms
and conditions of employment, working conditions and citizenship requirements); tax obligations, including
obligations on remote sellers to collect transaction taxes such as sales or similar taxes; the representation of financial
results; veterinary practices, or the operation of veterinary hospitals in stores that may impact our ability to operate
veterinary hospitals in certain facilities; the transportation, handling and sale of small pets; the generation, handling,
storage, transportation and disposal of waste and biohazardous materials; the distribution, import/export and sale of
products; providing services to our customers; environmental regulation; credit and debit card processing; the
handling, security, protection and use of customer and associate information; the licensing and certification of services;
food and product safety; and consumer protection laws related to product labeling, advertising, data privacy and
marketing could have an adverse impact, directly or indirectly, on our financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, changes in enforcement priorities by governmental agencies charged with enforcing existing laws and
regulations can increase our cost of doing business. For instance, in 2016, the FDA issued guidance regarding complete
pet food products (i.e., products providing all of the nutrients needed to meet an animal’s total daily nutrient
requirements) that are labeled or marketed with claims that may suggest that they are intended to treat or prevent
diseases in pets. Because such products potentially meet the statutory definition of a drug under the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, but are not typically registered as such, the FDA set out a list of specific factors it considers
in determining whether to initiate enforcement action against such products if they do not comply with the regulatory
requirements applicable to drugs. These factors include, among other things, whether the product is only made
available through or under the direction of a veterinarian and does not present a known safety risk when used as
labeled. While we believe that we sell our products in compliance with the policy articulated in FDA’s guidance, there
is a possibility that the FDA could shift its thinking on this topic in terms of guidance or enforcement discretion, which
could lead to alleged regulatory violations, enforcement actions, and/or product recalls.

Given varying and uncertain interpretations of applicable laws and regulations and the fact that the laws and
regulations are enforced by the courts and by regulatory authorities with broad discretion, we can make no assurances
that we would be found to be in compliance in all jurisdictions. We also could be subject to costs, including fines,
penalties, or sanctions and third-party claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, the above-referenced laws
and regulations.

53


-----

**_Labor disputes may have an adverse effect on our operations._**

None of our employees is represented by a union, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining
agreements. If we were to experience a union organizing campaign, this activity could be disruptive to our operations.
We cannot assure you that some or all of our employees will not become covered by a collective bargaining agreement
or that we will not encounter labor conflicts or strikes. Any labor disruptions could have an adverse effect on our
business or results of operations and could cause us to lose customers.

**_We may incur costs associated with litigation and other events such as natural disasters and our insurance may_**
**_not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims._**

From time to time we or our subsidiaries are involved in individual lawsuits, class actions and/or other claims
arising in the course of business, including those related to federal or state wage and hour laws, product liability,
consumer protection, advertising, employment, intellectual property, tort and other matters. We may also be subject
to lawsuits, class actions and/or claims relating to the design, manufacture or distribution of our private brand products.
In addition, since we send short message service, or SMS, text messages to customers, the actual or perceived improper
sending of text messages may subject us to liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws. Numerous classaction suits under federal and state laws have been filed in recent years against companies who conduct SMS texting
programs, with many resulting in multimillion-dollar settlements to the plaintiffs. Even an unsuccessful challenge of
our SMS texting practices by our customers, regulatory authorities, or other third parties could result in negative
publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us.

We may incur losses relating to claims filed against us, including costs associated with defending against
them, and there is risk that any such claims or liabilities will not be covered by existing insurance policies, exceed our
insurance coverage, or affect our ability to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Insurance costs continue
to be volatile, and are affected by natural catastrophes, fear of terrorism, the litigation environment, and fiscal viability
of insurers. We believe that obtaining commercial insurance coverage is prudent for risk management, and insurance
costs may increase substantially in the future. In addition, for certain types or levels of risk, such as risks associated
with earthquakes, hurricanes or terrorist attacks, we may determine that we cannot obtain commercial insurance at
acceptable prices. Therefore, we may choose to forgo or limit our purchase of relevant commercial insurance, choosing
instead to self-insure one or more types or levels of risks. We maintain provisions for losses related to certain selfinsured risks that are based upon independent actuarially determined estimates. We also maintain stop-loss coverage
to limit the exposure related to certain other risks. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim
losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. Similarly,
changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can
impact ultimate costs. Any changes in these variables could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and
currently recorded liabilities and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

**_Affiliates of the Investor Group will continue to control us and their interests may conflict with our interests or the_**
**_interests of the holders of the notes in the future._**

PetSmart is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings and Holdings is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of a
parent company of which all or substantially all of the issued and outstanding capital stock is beneficially owned by
certain funds affiliated with the Investor Group. In addition, the Investor Group has the right to designate all of the
members of our board of directors and the boards of directors and managers of our parent companies. As a result, the
Investor Group has control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and has the ability to prevent any
transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or stockholders, regardless of whether the holders of
notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, the Investor Group could cause
us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, or to sell assets,
which may impair our ability to make payments under the notes.

In addition, the Investor Group is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to
time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. As a result, the Investor
Group may vote in a manner so as to restrict us from expanding our business or entering into additional lines of
business which may be related to the current or future operations of these investments. The Investor Group may also
pursue acquisitions that may be complementary with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may

54


-----

not be available to us. So long as the Investor Group continues to indirectly own a significant amount of the outstanding
shares of our common stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, the Investor Group can continue to strongly
influence or effectively control our decisions.

**_We will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002._**

Since we will not register the notes under the Securities Act after this offering, we will not be subject to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires public companies to have and maintain effective disclosure controls and
procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have management review the effectiveness of
those controls on a quarterly basis. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires public companies to have and maintain
effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have management review the effectiveness of those controls on
an annual basis (and have the independent auditor attest to the effectiveness of such internal controls). We will not be
required to comply with these requirements and therefore we may not have comparable procedures in place as
compared to other public companies. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and
procedures are not effective, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results and prevent fraud, which may
cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.

**_Changes in laws, accounting standards, and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management_**
**_related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results._**

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and related accounting pronouncements,
implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters relevant to our business are
highly complex, continually evolving, and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by us.
Changes in these rules or their interpretation, or changes in facts, underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments by
us could significantly impact our reported or expected financial performance.

**Risks Related to Our Relationship with and Separation from Chewy**

**_If we are no longer under common control or otherwise affiliated with Chewy, we may be unable to continue to_**
**_benefit from that relationship, which may adversely affect our operations and have a material adverse effect on us._**

Our relationship with Chewy provides us with increased scale and reach. We leverage our combined scale to
lower costs and coordinate purchases across our operations to reduce costs. If we no longer benefit from this
relationship, whether because we are no longer affiliated with Chewy or otherwise, it may result in increased costs for
us and higher prices to our customers, any of which may adversely affect our operations and have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results or operations.

Chewy is not restricted from competing with us. Due to the significant resources of Chewy, including
financial resources, growing name recognition and know-how and brand awareness from its association with us,
Chewy could have a significant competitive advantage over us should consumer demand move towards e-commerce
platforms, which may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and may materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Conflicts of interest may arise because some of PetSmart’s directors may directly or indirectly own stock or other_**
**_equity-linked interests in Chewy and hold management or board positions with Chewy._**

Some of PetSmart’s directors may directly or indirectly own equity interests in Chewy. In addition, some of
PetSmart’s directors are also directors of Chewy. Ownership of such equity interests by PetSmart’s directors and the
presence of directors or officers of Chewy on our board of directors, now or in the future, could create, or appear to
create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving both us and any one of them, or involving us and Chewy,
that could have different implications for any of these investors than they do for us. In addition, we may be unable to
take advantage of corporate opportunities presented to individuals who are directors of both us and our affiliates,
including Chewy. As a result, we may be precluded from pursuing certain advantageous transactions or growth
initiatives.

**_Our inability to resolve in a manner favorable to us any potential conflicts or disputes that arise between us and_**
**_Chewy or its subsidiaries with respect to our past and ongoing relationships may adversely affect our business and_**
**_prospects._**

Potential conflicts or disputes may arise between Chewy or its subsidiaries and us in a number of areas
relating to our past or ongoing relationships, including:

    - tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our relationship with Chewy
or its subsidiaries;

    - business combinations involving us;

    - business opportunities that may be attractive to us and Chewy or its subsidiaries;

    - intellectual property or other proprietary rights; and

    - joint sales and marketing activities with Chewy or its subsidiaries.

The resolution of any potential conflicts or disputes between us and Chewy or its subsidiaries over these or other
matters may be less favorable to us than the resolution we might achieve if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.
The agreements we have entered into with Chewy and certain of its subsidiaries are of varying durations and may be
amended upon agreement of the parties.

**_The pro forma financial statements and other pro forma financial information included in this offering_**
**_memorandum are presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial condition_**

The unaudited pro forma financial statements and other pro forma financial information contained in this
offering memorandum are presented for illustrative purposes only, are based on various adjustments, assumptions and
preliminary estimates and may not be an indication of our actual financial condition or results of operations following
consummation of the Chewy Distribution. The summary unaudited pro forma financial information has not been

actually obtain if such transactions occurred at any such date, nor does such data purport to project the results of
operations for any future period. Our actual financial condition and results of operations following consummation of
the Chewy Distribution may not be consistent with, or evident from, these pro forma financial statements. In addition,
the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma combined financial information may not prove to be accurate, and
other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations following consummation of the Chewy

and Pro Forma Financial and Other Data.”

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our_**
**_obligations under the notes._**

After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which will require
significant interest and principal payments. As of November 1, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions,
we would have had approximately $4,650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, including $2,300.0
million of outstanding term loans under the new term loan facility, as well as the notes offered hereby. On a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our estimated interest expense for such amount of indebtedness for the
twelve months ended November 1, 2020 would have been approximately $297.7 million. We also anticipate that we
would have unused availability under the new ABL facility of $750.0 million (without giving effect to the $62.0
million of letters of credit currently outstanding under the existing ABL facility that are expected to remain outstanding
under the new ABL facility), subject to a borrowing base.

56


-----

Our and our subsidiaries’ substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences to holders
of the notes, including:

    - continuing to require us and certain of our subsidiaries to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash
flow from operations to the payment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for
operations and any future business opportunities;

    - limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which
we operate;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness;

    - increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;

    - making us and our subsidiaries more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under
the new senior secured credit facilities will be at variable rates; and

    - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.

**_Our ability to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, depends on many factors beyond our control,_**
**_and if we cannot generate enough cash to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy_**
**_our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations with respect to our debt, including
the notes, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic,
financial, competitive, legislative, legal and regulatory factors and other factors beyond our control. We may not be
able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to fund our day-to-day operations
or to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes.

Cash flows from operations are the principal source of funding for us. Our business may not generate cash
flow from operations in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. If our cash flows are insufficient to service
our indebtedness, including the notes, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek
additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. Our ability to restructure or
refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such
time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict our business operations and limit our financial flexibility. In addition, the terms
of existing or future debt agreements, including the credit agreements that will govern the new senior secured credit
facilities and the indentures that will govern the senior first lien notes and the senior notes offered hereby, may restrict
us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our
outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm
our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and, as a result, our
liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected and we may not be able to meet our scheduled debt
service obligations.

**_Despite our substantial level of indebtedness, the agreements that will govern our new senior secured credit_**
**_facilities and the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit us and our subsidiaries to incur_**
**_substantial additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial_**
**_indebtedness._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the
credit agreements that will govern our new senior secured credit facilities will contain restrictions on the incurrence
of additional indebtedness, these restrictions will be subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the
indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions will not
prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If we incur any additional

57


-----

indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with you in any
proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up
of our company, subject to any collateral arrangements. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds
paid to you. In addition, as of November 1, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we
anticipate that the new ABL facility would have provided for unused availability of $750.0 million (without giving
effect to the $62.0 million of letters of credit currently outstanding under the existing ABL facility that are expected
to remain outstanding under the new ABL facility), subject to a borrowing base. Any such borrowings under our new
senior secured credit facilities, and the senior first lien notes offered hereby, will be secured indebtedness and therefore
would be effectively senior to the senior notes offered hereby and the note guarantees by the guarantors to the extent
of the assets securing such debt. To the extent we and our subsidiaries incur further indebtedness, the substantial risks
related to our level of indebtedness would increase. See “Description of Other Indebtedness,” “Description of Senior
First Lien Notes” and “Description of Senior Unsecured Notes.”

**_Our debt agreements contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business._**

The operating and financial covenants and restrictions in the indentures that will govern the notes offered
hereby and the credit agreements that will govern the new senior secured credit facilities and other debt that we incur
in the future may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other
business activities that may be in our interest. The agreements governing our indebtedness will restrict, subject to
certain important exceptions and qualifications, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

    - incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness;

    - pay dividends or make distributions or make certain other restricted payments;

    - make certain investments;

    - create liens on our or the guarantors’ assets;

    - sell assets;

    - enter into transactions with affiliates;

    - enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

    - designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

    - enter into mergers or consolidations or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

In addition, as discussed under “Description of Other Indebtedness—New ABL Facility,” if our excess
liquidity under the new ABL facility is below specified levels for a certain period of time, we will be subject to
compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0:1.0.

A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby or
under the credit agreements that will govern the new senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default
under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result
in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an
event of default under the credit agreements that will govern the new senior secured credit facilities will permit the
lenders under the new senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such
facilities. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the new senior secured credit
facilities and the senior first lien notes offered hereby, those lenders or collateral agents, subject to terms of an
intercreditor agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event
our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient
assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:

58


-----

    - limited in how we conduct our business;

    - unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business
downturns; or

    - unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

These restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial
results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our
financing.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to_**
**_increase significantly._**

Borrowings under the new senior secured credit facilities will be at variable rates of interest and will expose
us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness
would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including
cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. As of November 1, 2020, after giving
effect to the Transactions, approximately $2,300.0 million of our debt would have been variable rate debt, and holding
other variables constant, an increase or decrease in interest rates by 0.25% (25 basis points) on our variable rate debt
would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $5.7 million. In the future, we may enter
into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest
rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness,
and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.

**_The notes and the subsidiary guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our non-guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

The notes and the subsidiary guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other
liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, which will include, among others, all our subsidiaries formed outside of
the United States, including our Canadian subsidiary that will be a borrower under the new ABL facility. The
indentures that will govern the notes will allow any non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness
in the future and will not limit the incurrence of liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. Any right that Issuers
or the subsidiary guarantors have to receive any assets of any non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or
reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of the notes to realize proceeds from the sale
of any of those subsidiaries’ assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those non-guarantor subsidiaries’
creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of those subsidiaries. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their debt, including their trade
creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding indebtedness or guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, are generally
entitled to payment on their claims from assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for
distribution to us.

As of November 1, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the non-guarantor subsidiaries
would have had $22.7 million of indebtedness (excluding intercompany liabilities). As of November 1, 2020, on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor would have had $4,650
million of indebtedness and $3,500 million of such indebtedness would have been secured. Our non-guarantor
subsidiaries accounted for approximately $557.6 million, or 7.8%, of our total net sales, and approximately $37.7
million, or 6.5%, of our operating income, in each case for fiscal year 2019. Excluding the effect of intercompany
balances as well as intercompany transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $429.0
million, or 3.7%, of our total assets, and approximately $218.0 million, or 2.0%, of our total liabilities, in each case
as of November 1, 2020. In addition, PetSmart’s Canadian non-guarantor subsidiary will be a borrower under the new
ABL facility.

-----

**_The lenders under the new term loan facility will have the discretion to release guarantors under such facility in a_**
**_variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors to be released from their guarantees of the notes and_**
**_will also cause any liens on their assets securing the senior first lien notes to be released._**

So long as any obligations under the new term loan facility remain outstanding, any guarantee of the notes
may be released, and any liens on the assets of such guarantors securing the senior first lien notes may be released,
without action by, or consent of, any holder of notes or the trustee under the indentures that will govern the notes if,
at the discretion of lenders under the new term loan facility, the related guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations
under the new term loan facility. The lenders under the new term loan facility will have the discretion to release the
guarantees under the new term loan facility in a variety of circumstances. If any of our subsidiaries are released as a
guarantor of the new term loan facility, such guarantor will be automatically released as a guarantor of the notes, in
which case any liens on the assets of such subsidiary in favor of the new term loan facility and the senior first lien
notes will also be released. In addition, if the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor’s guarantee of the new term loan
facility is released, it will automatically be released as a guarantor of the notes, in which case the pledge of the Chewy
Stock Collateral securing the new senior secured credit facilities and the senior first lien notes will also be released.
You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary or against the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, in each
case, to the extent such entity that is no longer a guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities,
including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to your claims
as a holder of the notes.

**_The guarantee by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor will be automatically released in certain_**
**_circumstances other than upon repayment of the notes._**

Under each indenture that governs a series of the notes, the affiliate guarantee provided by the Chewy Stock
Affiliate Guarantor will automatically be released upon PetSmart’s Consolidated Total Debt Ratio being equal to or
less than 2.00:1.00 (as calculated pursuant to such indentures) and such release will also apply with respect to the new
senior secured credit facilities. In addition, if the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor’s guarantee of the new term loan
facility is released, it will automatically be released as a guarantor of the notes, in which case the pledge of the Pledged
Chewy Stock securing the senior first lien notes will also be released.

**_We may not be able to purchase the notes upon a Change of Control, which would result in a default under the_**
**_indentures that will govern the notes and would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition._**

Upon a Change of Control with respect to a series of notes as described under “Description of Senior First
Lien Notes” and “Description of Senior Unsecured Notes,” we will be required to make an offer to purchase all of the
notes of such series then outstanding at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the repurchase date. Additionally, under the new senior secured credit facilities, a change of control (as
defined therein) will constitute an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings
under the respective agreements and terminate their commitments to lend. The source of funds for any purchase of the
notes offered hereby and repayment of borrowings under the new senior secured credit facilities would be our available
cash or cash generated from other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by
our existing or new stockholders. We may not be able to repurchase the notes of such series upon a Change of Control
because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a
change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due. If we fail to repurchase the notes of such
series in that circumstance, we will be in default under the indentures that will govern the notes. We may require
additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on
satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the notes may be limited by law. In addition, certain
corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not
constitute a “change of control” under the indentures even though those corporate events could increase the level of
our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. See
“Description of Senior First Lien Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control” and “Description
of Senior Unsecured Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the notes_**
**_under applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer and resell the notes without_**
**_registration under applicable securities laws._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, and we do not currently intend to register the notes. The holders of the notes will not
be entitled to require us to register the notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in
the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws. Notwithstanding the availability of an exemption from the registration
requirements under the Securities Act, the notes may not be resold or transferred except to (i) investors that are QIBs
pursuant to Rule 144A that are also Qualified Purchasers or (ii) investors that are non-U.S. persons pursuant to
Regulation S that are also Qualified Purchasers. Your ability to transfer or resell the notes may therefore be limited.
You may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the indentures by beneficial owners with short positions in excess_**
**_of their interests in the notes of a particular series will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the notes of either series, each holder of notes of such series agrees, in connection with any
notice of default, notice of acceleration, or instruction to the Trustee or the collateral agent for the senior first lien
notes, as applicable, to provide a notice of default, notice of acceleration, or take any other action (a “Noteholder
Direction”), to (i) deliver a written representation to the Issuers and the Trustee and the collateral agent for the senior
first lien notes, if applicable, that such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its
investment in the notes (other than screened affiliates) are not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that
such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as
defined under “Description of Senior First Lien Notes” and “Description of Senior Unsecured Notes”), and (ii) provide
the Issuers with such other information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the
accuracy of such holder’s representation within five business days of request therefor. Holders of the notes, including
holders that have hedged their exposure to the notes in the ordinary course and not for speculative purposes, may not
be able to make such representations or provide the requested additional information. These restrictions may impact
a holder’s ability to participate in Noteholder Directions.

**_Many of the covenants in the indentures that will govern the notes will not apply to us if the notes are rated_**
**_investment grade by any two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch._**

Many of the covenants in the indentures that will govern the notes will cease to apply to a series of the notes
during such time, if any, as such series of the notes are rated investment grade by any two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch
and no event of default with respect to such series of the notes has occurred and is continuing. Such covenants restrict,
among other things, our ability to pay distributions, incur debt and enter into certain other transactions. Although there
can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade, any suspension of such covenants under the
indentures that will govern the notes would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted
when such covenants were in force. To the extent any suspended covenants are subsequently reinstated, any actions
taken by us while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of default under the applicable indenture
on the basis that such actions would have been prohibited by the covenants. See “Description of Senior First Lien
Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants When Notes Are Rated Investment Grade” and “Description
of Senior Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants When Notes Are Rated Investment
Grade.”

**_Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active trading_**
**_market may not develop for the notes._**

The notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading market. We expect the
notes to be eligible for trading by “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined under Rule 144A, but we do not intend
to list the notes on any national securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation
system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes, as permitted by applicable
laws and regulations; however, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes and, if
commenced, they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active

61


-----

market for the notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity
of the notes. In such case, the holders of the notes may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable
price. If a trading market were to develop, future trading prices of the notes may be volatile and will depend on many
factors, including:

    - the number of holders of notes;

    - our operating performance and financial condition;

    - the market for similar securities;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes; and

    - prevailing interest rates.

Even if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may experience
similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which
you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their
initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other
factors.

**_A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to the notes, if any, could cause_**
**_the liquidity or market value of the notes to decline._**

The notes have been rated by rating agencies. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold the
notes. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not
be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances relating to the
basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any downgrades in our credit ratings, or any
announcements that our credit ratings are under further review for a downgrade or have otherwise been placed on
negative watch or outlook, could increase our borrowing costs or increase the cost of doing business or otherwise
negatively impact our business operations. Any such action or withdrawal of a rating by a rating agency could also
reduce the liquidity or market value of the notes.

**_The terms of the new senior secured credit facilities have not been finalized._**

The credit agreement relating to the new senior secured credit facilities has not been finalized. Our ability to
successfully syndicate the new senior secured credit facilities is subject to market conditions, and we cannot assure
you that the new senior secured credit facilities will be successfully syndicated on the terms described herein. Future
changes in market conditions may result in changes to the terms for the new senior secured credit facilities, including
pricing, that are less favorable to us and may increase the our interest expense and adversely affect our business. The
terms of the new senior secured credit facilities could also change in a way that increases our indebtedness or makes
it easier to incur debt in the future.

**_Prior to or when the new senior secured credit facilities mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace them._**

The new term loan facility and the new ABL facility are expected to have an earlier maturity date than the
notes of each series. Prior to or when the new term loan facility and the new ABL facility mature, we may need to
refinance them and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. Changes in our credit profile or deterioration
in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets. If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness,
the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict our
financial and operating flexibility. If we are unable to refinance the new term loan facility and the new ABL facility
prior to or when they mature it could result in an event of default under the new term loan facility or the new ABL

62


-----

facility or under the indentures that will govern the notes. Any future refinancing of any credit facility may also not
extend the maturity of such facility beyond the maturity of the notes of each series. Moreover, the occurrence of an
event of default under the credit agreement that will govern the new term loan facility or the new ABL facility or the
indentures that will govern the notes could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness.

**Risks Related to the Senior First Lien Notes**

**_Sales of assets by the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors could reduce the pool of assets securing the senior first_**
**_lien notes and the related guarantees._**

The security documents that will relate to the senior first lien notes will allow the Issuers and the subsidiary
guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of
any income from, the cash flow collateral and ABL collateral that will secure the senior first lien notes. To the extent
we sell any assets that constitute such collateral, the proceeds from such sale will be subject to the liens securing the
senior first lien notes and the related guarantees only to the extent such proceeds would otherwise constitute
“collateral” securing the senior first lien notes and the related guarantees under the security documents. Such proceeds
will also be subject to the security interests of certain creditors other than the holders of the senior first lien notes,
some of which may be senior or prior to the liens held by the holders of the senior first lien notes, or may have a lien
in those assets that is pari passu with the lien of the holders of the senior first lien notes. For example, the lenders
under the new ABL facility will have a first-priority lien in the ABL collateral securing the senior first lien notes and
the holders of the senior first lien notes, together with the lenders under the new term loan facility, will have a secondpriority lien in the ABL collateral. To the extent the proceeds from any sale of collateral do not constitute “collateral”
under the security documents, the pool of assets securing the senior first lien notes and the related guarantees will be
reduced, and the senior first lien notes and the related guarantees will not be secured by such proceeds.

**_The value of the collateral securing the senior first lien notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under_**
**_the senior first lien notes._**

Obligations under the senior first lien notes will be secured by a first-priority lien on the cash flow collateral
and the Pledged Chewy Stock and a second-priority lien on the ABL collateral. No appraisal of the value of such
collateral has been made in connection with this offering, and the fair market value of the collateral will be subject to
fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, changing economic conditions, competition and other future
trends. By its nature, some or all of such collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the lenders under the new ABL facility
(and under any related hedging obligations and cash management agreements) will be entitled to be repaid in full from
the proceeds of the ABL collateral before any payment is made to the lenders under the new term loan facility and the
holders of the senior first lien notes from the proceeds of the ABL collateral, and the lenders under the new term loan
facility and the holders of the senior first lien notes will be entitled to be repaid in full from the proceeds of the cash
flow collateral before any payment is made in respect of any other indebtedness (including the new ABL facility)
secured by a junior lien on the cash flow collateral. Moreover, the lenders under the new term loan facility and the
holders of any other additional indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the cash flow collateral will share the
proceeds of the cash flow collateral ratably with the holders of the senior first lien notes, thereby diluting the collateral
coverage. In particular, the fair market value of the cash flow collateral and ABL collateral may not be sufficient to
repay the holders of the senior first lien notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding and
after the repayment of indebtedness with prior security interests in the collateral, including our obligations under the
new ABL facility with respect to the ABL collateral. There also can be no assurance that the cash flow collateral and
ABL collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain.

In addition, obligations under the senior first lien notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by the Pledged
Chewy Stock. No appraisal of the value of the Pledged Chewy Stock has been made in connection with this offering,
and the value of that collateral will be subject to fluctuations due to various factors as described under “—The value
of the Pledged Chewy Stock securing the senior first lien notes has not been appraised and may be subject to
fluctuations, and may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the senior first lien notes.” Moreover, the
collateral agent’s ability to foreclose on the Pledged Chewy Stock is subject to a number of additional risks as
described under “—The ability of the collateral agent to foreclose on the Pledged Chewy Stock may be limited” and
elsewhere in these risk factors. Moreover, the lenders under the new term loan facility and the holders of any other

63


-----

additional indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the Pledged Chewy Stock will share the proceeds of the cash
flow collateral ratably with the holders of the senior first lien notes, thereby diluting the collateral coverage.

Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the senior first
lien notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the senior first lien notes
from the sale of the collateral securing the senior first lien notes and the obligations under the senior first lien notes
will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness (including the senior
notes) and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of the senior
first lien notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to
the extent the amount of the obligations due under the senior first lien notes exceeded the value of the collateral (after
taking into account all other first-priority debt that was also secured by the collateral), or any “adequate protection”
on account of any undersecured portion of the senior first lien notes. See “—In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuers
or any of the guarantors, holders of the senior first lien notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent
that the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the senior first lien notes exceed the fair market value of the collateral
securing the senior first lien notes and the related guarantees.”

With respect to some of the cash flow collateral and ABL collateral, the collateral agent’s security interest
and ability to foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third party
consents and making additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security
interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to such collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We
cannot assure you that any such required consents will be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may
limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and may delay any sale,
either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral. Therefore, the practical value of
realizing on cash flow collateral and ABL collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited.

Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the senior first lien notes, we will be permitted to incur
indebtedness in amounts in excess of the commitments under the new ABL facility. All of the commitments under the
new ABL facility will be secured by the ABL collateral on a first-priority lien basis and will be entitled to payment
out of the proceeds of any sale of the ABL collateral before the holders of the senior first lien notes are entitled to any
recovery from the ABL collateral.

The indenture that will govern the senior first lien notes and the guarantee and pledge agreement that will
govern the Chewy Stock Collateral Pledge will also permit the Issuers and the guarantors to create additional liens on
the collateral under specified circumstances (including, in the case of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, additional
liens on the Pledged Chewy Stock), some of which liens may be pari passu with or senior to the liens securing the
senior first lien notes. Any obligations secured by such liens may further dilute the collateral coverage and limit the
recovery from the realization of the collateral available to satisfy holders of the senior first lien notes. See “Description
of Senior First Lien Notes—Certain Covenants—Liens.”

**_The value of the Pledged Chewy Stock securing the senior first lien notes and other first-lien debt has not been_**
**_appraised and may be subject to fluctuations, and may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the senior_**
**_first lien notes._**

Obligations under the senior first lien notes will be secured by the Chewy Stock Collateral Pledge. See “Description
of Senior First Lien Notes— Security for the Notes—Pledge of Chewy Stock.” The value of the Pledged Chewy
Stock has not been appraised. The shares of the Pledged Chewy Stock are initially Class B Chewy common stock,
that are not listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and would automatically convert upon transfer into shares of
Class A Chewy common stock. Although the Class A common stock issued by Chewy is currently listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, the value of the Pledged Chewy Stock may be subject to fluctuations due to various factors
that could affect the price of Chewy’s common stock, including, but not limited to, changes in Chewy’s financial
condition, results of operations or prospects, or because of complex and interrelated political, economic, financial
and other factors that can affect the capital markets generally, the stock exchanges or markets on which Chewy’s
common stock is traded and the market segment of which Chewy is a part. For a description of the risks related to
Chewy and its common stock, see “Risk Factors,” in Chewy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended February 2, 2020.

-----

In addition, PetSmart will not control Chewy, and Chewy and/or its affiliates could take actions that could
cause the market price of Chewy’s common stock and, as a result, the value of the Pledged Chewy Stock, to decline.
The value of the Pledged Chewy Stock could also be adversely impacted by potential dilution from future issuances
of common stock or other equity or equity-linked securities by Chewy, whether to raise capital, pursuant to an equity
incentive plan, in connection with the repayment of indebtedness, corporate restructurings, mergers and acquisitions
or otherwise. In addition, the sale of a substantial number of shares of Chewy common stock by stockholders, or the
perception that such sales may occur, could adversely impact the value of the Pledged Chewy Stock, including in
connection with any foreclosure upon certain shares of Chewy common stock that are pledged to secure other
indebtedness or obligations of stockholders, the amount of which may vary over time and may be material relative to
the amount of indebtedness secured by the Pledged Chewy Stock. Chewy may also enter into significant transactions
which may adversely affect the price of Chewy’s common stock and the value of the Pledged Chewy Stock as a result.
Any such dilutive issuances or sales of Chewy’s common stock or the possibility of such events could have the effect
of increasing the volatility in Chewy’s stock price or putting significant downward pressure on the price of Chewy’s
shares, and could significantly decrease the value of the Pledged Chewy Stock relative to its current market value.
Following the Chewy Distribution, PetSmart will have no ability to control Chewy or prevent it from taking such
actions. In the event that the value of the Pledged Chewy Stock declines, including as a result of these or other events,
there will be no obligation for us or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor to pledge any additional shares of Chewy
common stock or otherwise replace such lost value with additional assets or collateral of any kind.

Further, the value of the Pledged Chewy Stock and any amount to be recovered upon an enforcement action
in the case of an event of default under the indenture that will govern the senior first lien notes, will depend on many
factors, including, among others, the ability of the Collateral Agent to sell such common stock in an orderly sale and
the availability of buyers. There can be no assurance that the collateral agent will be able to sell the Pledged Chewy
Stock at advantageous prices or at all. The ability of the collateral agent to foreclose on the Pledged Chewy Stock,
upon the occurrence of an event of default or otherwise, will also be subject in certain instances to perfection and
priority issues. Each of these factors could reduce the likelihood of an enforcement action as well as reduce the amount
of any proceeds obtained from the sale of the Pledged Chewy Stock in the event of an enforcement action. The
proceeds from the sale of the Pledged Chewy Stock may not be sufficient and may be substantially less than the
amount necessary to satisfy claims of the holders of the senior first lien notes and other first lien obligations secured
by the Pledged Chewy Stock. Further, the notes will only be guaranteed by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor and
the senior first lien notes will only be secured by the Pledged Chewy Stock as collateral, until such time that PetSmart’s
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio is equal to or less than 2.00:1.00 (as calculated pursuant to the indentures governing
the notes) at which point the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor’s guarantee and pledge will be automatically and
unconditionally released. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the senior
first lien notes from the sale of the Pledged Chewy Stock and the other collateral securing the senior first lien notes
and the obligations of the Issuers under the senior first lien notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of the
Issuers’ other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness (including the senior notes) and other obligations, including
trade payables.

**_The ability of the collateral agent to foreclose on the Pledged Chewy Stock may be limited._**

The collateral agent’s security interest and ability to foreclose on the Pledged Chewy Stock could also be
subject to certain limitations, including under applicable securities laws. The Pledged Chewy Stock is held in the form
of certificated shares of Class B common stock of Chewy, which are convertible into an equal number of shares of
Class A common stock of Chewy. The collateral agent will not benefit from any contractual agreement with Chewy
that would require Chewy or the transfer agent for its common stock to cooperate with a conversion of the Pledged
Chewy Stock into shares of Class A common stock, or any transfer of the Pledged Chewy Stock in foreclosure. If the
collateral agent were to foreclose on the Pledged Chewy Stock, any shares of Class A common stock of Chewy that it
obtains (including upon automatic conversion of the Class B common stock comprising the Pledged Chewy Stock)
may be restricted securities, and the collateral agent would not have any contractual right to cause Chewy to register
such shares for resale under applicable securities laws. As a result, the collateral agent may not be able to sell the
Pledged Chewy Stock freely, any such sale may be subject to liquidity discounts which could be significant, and the
potential lack of current information about Chewy could make it difficult to sell the Pledged Chewy Stock. Further,
there can be no assurance that such Pledged Chewy Stock would be saleable in a timely manner or at all. Accordingly,
the Pledged Chewy Stock may not generate sufficient value to pay all or any of the amounts due on the senior first

lien notes or the new senior secured credit facilities and other pari passu first lien debt that the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor may incur.

**_The rights of the holders of the senior first lien notes with respect to the ABL collateral will be substantially limited_**
**_by the terms of the ABL/cash flow intercreditor agreement._**

The collateral agent for the senior first lien notes will become party to an intercreditor agreement between
the agents under the new senior secured credit facilities, which will significantly restrict any action that may be taken
by the collateral agent for the senior first lien notes with respect to the ABL collateral. Under the terms of the ABL/cash
flow intercreditor agreement, at any time that obligations under the new ABL facility are outstanding, any actions that
may be taken with respect to (or in respect of) the ABL collateral that secures obligations under the new ABL facility
on a first-priority basis, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the ABL
collateral and to control the conduct of such proceedings, and the approval of amendments to, releases of the ABL
collateral from the lien of, and waivers of past defaults under, such documents relating to the new ABL facility, will
be at the direction of the holders of the obligations under the new ABL facility. In those circumstances, the senior first
lien notes collateral agent, on behalf of itself, the trustee and the holders of the senior first lien notes, will not have the
ability to control or direct such actions, even if an event of default under the indenture that will govern the senior first
lien notes has occurred or if the rights of the trustee, the collateral agent and the holders of the senior first lien notes
are or may be adversely affected; provided that, subject to the restriction in the next sentence, the collateral agent for
debt that has a junior lien on the ABL collateral may exercise any or all rights with respect to any ABL collateral only
after a period of 180 consecutive days from the date of delivery of written notice to the ABL collateral agent stating
that (i) an event of default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the obligations under such indenture or other debt facility
are currently due and payable in full and (iii) such agent intends to exercise its rights to take such actions, so long as
the agent under the new ABL facility has not commenced the exercise of remedies with respect to collateral. Even
after the end of the 180-day period, pursuant to the terms of the first lien intercreditor agreement, the collateral agent
under the new term loan facility will initially have exclusive control over all such enforcement actions with respect to
ABL collateral. See “Description of Senior First Lien Notes—Collateral.” The holders of the senior first lien notes
which are secured on a second-priority basis by the ABL collateral may be adversely affected by any such action taken
at the direction of the holders of obligations under the new ABL facility. In certain circumstances, the ABL collateral
released at the discretion of the agent under the new ABL facility would no longer secure the Issuers’ and the
guarantors’ obligations under the senior first lien notes and the related guarantees. In addition, because the holders of
the indebtedness under the new ABL facility will control the disposition of the ABL collateral, such holders could
decide not to proceed against the ABL collateral, regardless of whether there is a default under the documents
governing such indebtedness or under the indenture that will govern the senior first lien notes. In such event, the only
remedy available to the holders of the senior first lien notes prior to the expiration of the 180-day standstill period
described above (subject to certain restrictions contained in the ABL/cash flow intercreditor agreement) would be to
sue for payment on the senior first lien notes and the related guarantees. Furthermore, under the ABL/cash flow
intercreditor agreement, the collateral agent for the senior first lien notes may not assert any right of marshalling that
may be available under applicable law with respect to the ABL collateral. Without this waiver of the right of
marshalling, holders of indebtedness secured by first-priority liens in the ABL collateral would likely be required to
liquidate collateral on which the senior first lien notes did not have a lien, if any, prior to liquidating the collateral
securing the senior first lien notes, thereby maximizing the proceeds of the collateral that would be available to repay
obligations under the senior first lien notes. As a result of this waiver, the proceeds of sales of the ABL collateral
could be applied to repay any indebtedness secured by first-priority liens in the ABL collateral before applying
proceeds of other collateral securing such indebtedness, and the holders of senior first lien notes may recover less than
they would have if such proceeds were applied in the order most favorable to the holders of the senior first lien notes.

The ABL/cash flow intercreditor agreement will contain certain other provisions benefiting holders of
indebtedness under the new ABL facility, including provisions prohibiting the trustee and the collateral agent for the
senior first lien notes from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a number of important matters
regarding the ABL collateral (including any proposed sale thereof) and debtor-in-possession financing to be provided
to us to be secured by ABL collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the ABL collateral agent or the
other ABL secured parties. Moreover, after such filing, the value of the collateral could materially deteriorate and the
holders of the senior first lien notes would be subject to various limitations regarding their ability to seek adequate
protection of their interests in the ABL collateral. In addition, the rights of holders of obligations secured by first
priority liens to foreclose upon and sell such collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default also would be subject

66


-----

to limitations under applicable bankruptcy laws if we or any of our subsidiaries were to become subject to a bankruptcy
proceeding. The ABL/cash flow intercreditor agreement will also give the holders of first priority liens on the ABL
collateral the right to access and use the collateral that secures the senior first lien notes to allow those holders to
protect the ABL collateral and to process, store and dispose of the ABL collateral.

The liens on the ABL collateral securing the senior first lien notes will be subordinated in the manner set
forth in the ABL/cash flow intercreditor agreement to all senior liens thereon governed by the ABL/cash flow
intercreditor agreement (including the liens that will be granted to the lenders under the new ABL facility and other
creditors that may have the benefit of first-priority liens on such collateral from time to time, whether on or after the
date the senior first lien notes and guarantees are issued), irrespective of the time, order or method of creation,
attachment or perfection of any such senior liens or any failure, defect or deficiency or alleged failure, defect or
deficiency in any of the foregoing. Accordingly, the holders of the senior first lien notes’ liens on the ABL collateral
will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by
our creditors with prior liens thereon. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the senior first lien notes as well as the ability
of the collateral agent for the senior first lien notes to realize or foreclose on such collateral.

In addition, the ABL/cash flow intercreditor agreement will provide that if the holders of the senior first lien
notes obtain possession of any ABL collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any the ABL collateral
pursuant to their security documents or by the exercise of any rights available to them under applicable law or in any
bankruptcy proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies, at any time prior to the associated discharge of the
obligations under the new ABL facility secured, or intended to be secured, by the ABL collateral, then such holders
will be obligated to hold the ABL collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the applicable lenders under the new
ABL facility and transfer the ABL collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the representative thereof.
Thus, there can be no assurances that under the ABL/cash flow intercreditor agreement, the holders of the senior first
lien notes would not be obligated to turn over to the lenders under the new ABL facility certain collateral, proceeds
or payments they may receive.

**_Even though the holders of the senior first lien notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the cash flow collateral_**
**_and the Pledged Chewy Stock, the collateral agent under the new term loan facility will initially control actions_**
**_with respect to all such collateral._**

The rights of the holders of the senior first lien notes with respect to the collateral that will secure the senior
first lien notes on a first-priority basis, including the Pledged Chewy Stock, will be subject to a first lien intercreditor
agreement among all holders of obligations secured by that collateral on a first-priority basis, including the obligations
under the new term loan facility. Under that first lien intercreditor agreement, any actions that may be taken with
respect to such collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such
collateral, to control such proceedings and to approve amendments to releases of such collateral from the lien of, and
waive past defaults under, documents relating to such collateral, will be at the exclusive direction of the authorized
representative of the lenders under the new term loan facility until the earlier of (i) the date on which our obligations
under the new term loan facility are discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the new
senior secured credit facilities) or (ii) 180 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture that will
govern the senior first lien notes, if the senior first lien notes represent the largest outstanding principal amount of
indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the cash flow collateral and the Pledged Chewy Stock (including the
new term loan facility) and the collateral agent for the senior first lien notes has complied with the applicable notice
provisions so long as the agent under the new term loan facility has not commenced the exercise of remedies with
respect to collateral.

After the discharge of the obligations with respect to the new term loan facility, the right to direct the actions
with respect to the cash flow collateral and the Pledged Chewy Stock securing the senior first lien notes will pass to
the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a
first lien on the cash flow collateral and the Pledged Chewy Stock. If we issue additional indebtedness that is equal in
priority to the lien securing our first lien notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the senior first lien
notes, then the authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under
the first lien intercreditor agreement, rather than the trustee as the collateral agent for the senior first lien notes.
Accordingly, the trustee under the senior first lien notes indenture may never have the right to control remedies and

67


-----

take other actions with respect to the cash flow collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock.

In addition, under the terms of the first lien intercreditor agreement, if at any time (i) the controlling cash
flow collateral agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any cash flow collateral resulting in a
sale thereof or (ii) the applicable controlling collateral agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against
the Pledged Chewy Stock resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the senior first lien notes on such collateral or
Pledged Chewy Stock, as applicable, will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from
such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding first-priority obligations). The collateral so released will
no longer secure our and the guarantors’ obligations under the senior first lien notes and the guarantees. The first lien
intercreditor agreement will also prohibit the trustee and the collateral agent for the senior first lien notes from
objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to
us that is secured by the cash flow collateral and the Pledged Chewy Stock and that has not been opposed to or objected
to by the controlling cash flow collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties.

Also, under the first lien intercreditor agreement, in the event that the holders of the senior first lien notes
obtain possession of any collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such collateral at any time
prior to the discharge of each of the other first-priority obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such
collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of first-priority obligations and subject to the ABL/cash
flow intercreditor agreement promptly transfer such collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the case may be, to the
controlling cash flow collateral agent, in the case of the cash flow collateral, and to the applicable controlling collateral
agent, in the case of the Pledged Chewy Stock, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the first lien
intercreditor agreement among all the holders of first-priority obligations. Thus, there can be no assurances that under
the first lien intercreditor agreement, the holders of the senior first lien notes would not be obligated to turn over to
the other holders of the first-priority obligations any collateral, proceeds or payments they may receive.

Finally, holders of the senior first lien notes will waive certain important rights otherwise available to secured
creditors in a bankruptcy, including the right to object to certain debtor-in-possession financings.

**_There are circumstances, other than the repayment or discharge of the senior first lien notes, under which the_**
**_collateral and/or the Pledged Chewy Stock securing the senior first lien notes and the related guarantees will be_**
**_released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the collateral agent for the senior first lien notes,_**
**_and you may not realize any payment upon the release of such collateral or Pledged Chewy Stock._**

Under various circumstances, the collateral securing the senior first lien notes and note guarantees, and the
Pledged Chewy Stock securing the senior first lien notes and the affiliate guarantees, will be released automatically.

The collateral securing the senior first lien notes and the subsidiary guarantees will be released automatically:

    - with respect to collateral other than the Pledged Chewy Stock, upon a sale, transfer or other
disposition of such collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture that will govern the
senior first lien notes;

    - with respect to collateral held by a subsidiary guarantor, upon the release of such subsidiary
guarantor from its note guarantees;

    - if any Issuer or the notes are rated investment grade by any two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch; and

    - with respect to the ABL collateral, in connection with the foreclosure upon or the other exercise of
rights or remedies with respect to the ABL collateral by the ABL collateral agent.

The indenture that will govern the senior first lien notes will also permit us to designate one or more of our
restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the senior first lien notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a
subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture, all of the liens on any collateral owned
by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the senior first lien notes by that subsidiary or any
of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the

68


-----

aggregate value of the collateral securing the senior first lien notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the
unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of any such unrestricted subsidiary
and its subsidiaries will have a claim on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries senior to the claim
of the holders of the senior first lien notes.

In addition, (i) the affiliate guarantee of the notes by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor will be discharged
automatically and (ii) the Pledged Chewy Stock securing the senior first lien notes will be released automatically, in
each case, on the first date on which PetSmart’s Consolidated Total Debt Ratio (as defined under “Description of
Senior First Lien Notes”) is equal to or less than 2.00:1.00 (as calculated pursuant to the indenture governing the
senior first lien notes). Even if PetSmart’s Consolidated Total Debt Ratio (as calculated pursuant to the indenture
governing the senior first lien notes) later exceeds 2.00:1.00, such affiliate guarantee will not later be reinstated under
the indenture governing the senior first lien notes, and the Pledged Chewy Stock will not later be pledged to secure
the senior first lien notes.

**_Pledges of equity interests of certain of our foreign subsidiaries may not constitute collateral for the repayment of_**
**_the senior first lien notes because such pledges may not be perfected pursuant to foreign law pledge documents._**

Part of the security for the repayment of the senior first lien notes may consist of a pledge of up to 65% of
the voting capital stock of direct foreign subsidiaries owned by us or our domestic subsidiaries. Although such pledges
of capital stock will be required to be granted under U.S. security documents, it may be necessary or desirable to
perfect such pledges under foreign law pledge documents. We will not be required to provide such foreign law pledge
documents. Unless and until such pledges of equity interests are properly perfected, they may not constitute collateral
for the repayment of the senior first lien notes.

**_Certain laws and regulations may impose restrictions or limitations on foreclosure._**

The Issuers’ obligations under the senior first lien notes and the guarantors’ obligations under the respective
note guarantees are secured only by the collateral described in this offering memorandum. The collateral agent’s
ability to foreclose on the collateral on behalf of the holders of senior first lien notes may be subject to perfection,
priority issues, state law requirements, applicable bankruptcy law, and practical problems associated with the
realization of the collateral agent’s security interest or lien in the collateral, including cure rights, foreclosing on the
collateral within the time periods permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third party consents,
making additional filings, statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure. We cannot assure
you that the consents of any third parties and approvals by governmental entities will be given when required to
facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Therefore, we cannot assure you that foreclosure on the collateral will be
sufficient to make all payments on the senior first lien notes.

**_The note guarantees related to the senior first lien notes and the liens securing such note guarantees may not be_**
**_enforceable because of fraudulent conveyance laws and, as a result, you may be required to return payments_**
**_received by you in respect of the note guarantees and the liens._**

The incurrence of the note guarantees and the grant of liens by the guarantors (including any future note
guarantees and future liens) may be subject to review under U.S. federal bankruptcy law or relevant state fraudulent
conveyance laws if a bankruptcy case or lawsuit is commenced by or on behalf of the guarantors or their unpaid
creditors. In addition, the incurrence of the affiliate guarantee by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor and the grant
of pledge with respect to the Pledged Chewy Stock by the affiliate guarantor (including any future guarantees and
future liens in the event of a substitution of the Pledged Chewy Stock and/or assignment of the Chewy Stock Collateral
Pledge in accordance with the terms of the guarantee and pledge agreement that will govern the Chewy Stock
Collateral Pledge) may be subject to review under U.S. federal bankruptcy law or relevant state fraudulent conveyance
laws if a bankruptcy case or lawsuit is commenced by or on behalf of the affiliate guarantors or its unpaid creditors,
or by or on behalf of PetSmart or its unpaid creditors (including as a result of the Chewy Equity Distribution) or the
transferee of any Chewy common stock that is substituted for Pledged Chewy Stock.

Under these laws, if in such a case or lawsuit a court were to find that, at the time such guarantor incurred a
guarantee of the senior first lien notes or granted the lien, such guarantor:

69


-----

  - incurred the guarantee of the senior first lien notes or granted the lien with the intent of hindering, delaying
or defrauding current or future creditors,

  - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for incurring the note guarantee or
granting the lien,

  - was insolvent or was rendered insolvent,

  - was engaged, or about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business, or

  - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts and obligations beyond its ability to pay as such debts
and obligations matured (as all of the foregoing terms are defined in or interpreted under the relevant
fraudulent conveyance or transfer statutes),

then such court could avoid the note guarantee or lien of such guarantor or subordinate the amounts owing under such
note guarantee or such lien to such guarantor’s presently existing or future debt, or take other actions detrimental to
you.

It may be asserted (and a court may consequently determine) that the guarantors incurred their note
guarantees for the Issuers’ benefit and did not themselves receive a direct or indirect benefit from the issuance of the
senior first lien notes, such that they incurred the obligations under the note guarantees or granted the liens for less
than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law of
the jurisdiction that is being applied in any proceeding. Generally, a company would be considered insolvent if, at the
time it incurs the debt or issues the guarantee:

  - the sum of its debts (including contingent liabilities) is greater than its assets, at fair valuation;

  - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its
total existing debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and matured; or

  - it cannot pay its debts as they became due.

If a note guarantee or a lien is avoided as a fraudulent conveyance or found to be unenforceable for any
reason, you will not have a claim against that obligor and will only be a creditor of any Issuer or any guarantor to the
extent such Issuer’s or such guarantor’s obligation is not set aside or found to be unenforceable. You may also be
required to return payments you have received with respect to such note guarantees and liens.

Each note guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum
amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its note guarantee to be a fraudulent
transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the note guarantees from being avoided under applicable
fraudulent transfer laws or may reduce the guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes the note
guarantee worthless.

**_Rights of holders of the senior first lien notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings._**

The right of the collateral agent for the senior first lien notes to repossess and dispose of the collateral securing
the senior first lien notes and the related guarantees upon acceleration of the payment thereof is likely to be
significantly impaired by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us or our
domestic restricted subsidiaries that provide security for the senior first lien notes or note guarantees prior to, or
possibly even after, any collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral. Similarly, the right and ability
of the collateral agent to repossess and dispose of the Pledged Chewy Stock securing the affiliate guarantee upon the
occurrence of an event of default is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable bankruptcy law if a bankruptcy

proceeding were to be commenced by or against us, or by or against the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor and/or its
direct or indirect owners, in each case prior, or possibly even after, any collateral agent has repossessed and disposed
of the Pledged Chewy Stock. Under applicable bankruptcy law, a secured creditor such as the collateral agent may be
prohibited from foreclosing upon its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case or from disposing of security
repossessed from such debtor without bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the collateral agent for the senior first lien notes,
is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security
repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances).
Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents
or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that
the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary
according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in
the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time
as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of
repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A
bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value
of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise definition
of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy
court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the senior first lien notes could be delayed following
commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any such payments or whether any such
payment will be made at all, whether or when the collateral agent could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral,
or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the senior first lien notes would be compensated for any delay
in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.” Furthermore, any
disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary course of our business would also require
approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances).

In addition, if Chewy commenced, or had commenced against it, a bankruptcy proceeding (but we had not
commenced a bankruptcy proceeding), the plan of reorganization could result in the cancellation of the Chewy Stock
Affiliate Guarantor’s equity interests in Chewy and the issuance of new or replacement equity interests in Chewy to
the creditors of such subsidiary in satisfaction of their claims. Certain assets of Chewy are pledged as collateral for its
senior secured asset-backed credit facility, and Chewy may incur additional indebtedness in the future that is secured
by its assets. In a bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of the senior first lien notes will only receive value from the
Pledged Chewy Stock after payment of all debt or other senior or preferential obligations of Chewy.

**_In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuers or any of the guarantors, holders of the senior first lien notes may be_**
**_deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the senior first lien notes_**
**_exceed the fair market value of the collateral securing the senior first lien notes and the related guarantees._**

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Issuers or any of the guarantors, it is possible that the
bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the
collateral with respect to the senior first lien notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current
principal amount of the senior first lien notes. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the senior first lien notes
are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the senior first lien notes would be
bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the
benefits of security in the collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the senior first lien notes would
be limited to the value of the collateral.

Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would be, among other things, a lack of
entitlement on the part of the holders of the senior first lien notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses
and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the senior first lien notes to receive other “adequate
protection” under federal bankruptcy laws, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest
had been made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the
bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the senior first lien notes.

**_Rights of holders of the senior first lien notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect_**
**_the security interests._**

The collateral securing the senior first lien notes and the related guarantees will include substantially all of
our and our subsidiary guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets that secure our indebtedness under the new term loan
facility and the new ABL facility, whether now owned or acquired or arising in the future. Applicable law requires
that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the collateral securing the senior first lien notes
may not be perfected if we or the collateral agent are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens
on or prior to the date of the issuance of the senior first lien notes or thereafter. We will have limited obligations to
perfect the security interest of the holders of the senior first lien notes in specified collateral other than the filing of
financing statements. To the extent a security interest in certain collateral is not perfected on the date of the issuance
of the senior first lien notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of
the collateral. See “—Any future pledge of collateral or issuance of a guarantee might be avoidable by a trustee in
bankruptcy” below.

If additional material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become
guarantors under the indenture that will govern the senior first lien notes, additional financing statements would be
required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets
constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to be taken by the collateral agent for the
senior first lien notes or the collateral agent for the new term loan facility or the new ABL facility, to perfect the
security interest in such assets, such as the delivery of physical collateral, the execution of account control agreements
or the execution and recordation of mortgages or deeds of trust. Applicable law requires that certain property and
rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the time such property and rights
are acquired and identified. Trustee and the collateral agent for the senior first lien notes will not monitor, and we may
not inform the trustee or the collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral,
and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral.
The collateral agent for the senior first lien notes and the collateral agents for the new term loan facility and the new
ABL facility will not, and will have no obligation to, monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that
constitute collateral or the perfection of any security interests therein. Such inaction may result in the loss of the
security interest in such collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the senior first lien notes and the
guarantees against third parties.

**_Any future pledge of collateral or issuance of a guarantee might be avoidable by a trustee in bankruptcy._**

Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee in favor of the holders of the senior first lien notes might be
avoidable by the pledgor (as debtor-in-possession), guarantor or by its trustee in bankruptcy as a preferential transfer
or otherwise if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the pledgor or guarantor is
insolvent at the time of the pledge or guarantee, that pledge or issuance of that guarantee permits the holders of the
senior first lien notes to receive a greater recovery in a bankruptcy case of the pledgor under Chapter 7 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code than if such pledge or guarantee had not been given, and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the
pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof or the issuance of
the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period. To the extent that the grant of any such
security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security
interest and/or guarantee (as applicable).

In addition, the guarantee and pledge agreement that will govern the Chewy Stock Collateral Pledge will
include provisions that allow the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor to substitute Pledged Chewy Stock with an
equivalent number of shares of Class A and/or Class B common stock, and/or to assign its obligations under the
guarantee and pledge agreement to an affiliate. See “Description of Senior First Lien Notes— Security for the Notes—
Pledge of Chewy Stock.” Under any of such circumstances, there is a risk that such substitution of Pledged Chewy
Stock and/or guarantee assignment of such guarantee and pledge agreement might be avoidable as a preferential
transfer or otherwise.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that the lien searches on the collateral that will secure the notes and guarantees thereof
will reveal any or all existing liens on such collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be
significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the notes and guarantees thereof and could have an adverse
effect on the ability of the senior first lien notes collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the collateral securing
the notes and guarantees thereof.

**_The collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary
for our business. There are, however, certain losses, including those relating to environmental conditions, that may be
either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully
for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss or impairment in value of any of the pledged collateral, the insurance
proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the senior first lien notes and the
related guarantees.

**_The imposition of certain permitted liens will, under certain circumstances, permit the liens on the related assets_**
**_securing the senior first lien notes and the guarantees to be either subordinated to such permitted liens or released._**
**_There are also certain other assets that are also excluded from the collateral._**

The indentures that will govern the senior first lien notes, and the guarantee and pledge agreement that will
govern the Chewy Stock Collateral Pledge, in each case will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure additional
debt and, in the case of certain of such liens, the liens on the related assets securing the senior first lien notes and the
subsidiary guarantees or the affiliate guarantee, as applicable, may, under certain circumstances, be either subordinated
to such permitted liens or released. Our ability, and the ability of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, to incur
additional debt and liens on such additional debt in favor of third parties is subject to limitations as described herein
under “Description of Senior First Lien Notes.” However, such limitations are subject to important exceptions and
qualifications. As a result, we and the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor may incur substantial amounts of additional
debt secured by liens and other encumbrances in favor of third parties, and the security interest in the collateral
securing the senior first lien notes and the affiliate guarantee may, under certain circumstances, rank on parity with or
subordinate to such permitted liens or encumbrances.

In addition, certain assets are excluded from the collateral securing the senior first lien notes and the
subsidiary guarantees, as discussed under “Description of Senior First Lien Notes—Security for the Notes.” For
example, we are not obligated to pledge any leasehold interest in real estate so none of our stores are pledged. If an
event of default occurs and the maturity of the senior first lien notes is accelerated, the senior first lien notes and the
related subsidiary guarantees will rank pari passu with the holders of other unsecured or senior indebtedness of the
relevant obligor with respect to such excluded assets.

As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the senior first lien notes is less than the value of
the claims of the holders of the senior first lien notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our
unsecured creditors are paid.

**Risks Related to the Senior Notes**

**_The senior notes will not be secured by any of the collateral that secures the senior first lien notes and will be_**
**_effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness, including the senior first lien notes and borrowings under_**
**_the new senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured_**
**_indebtedness._**

Our obligations under the senior notes and the related note guarantees (including the affiliate guarantee) will
be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral
securing such secured indebtedness (with such collateral including the Pledged Chewy Stock). Borrowings under the
new senior secured credit facilities and the senior first lien notes will be secured by substantially all of the assets of

73


-----

the Issuers, the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor and any existing and future subsidiary guarantors, including all of
the capital stock of the Issuers and each restricted subsidiary (which, in the case of foreign subsidiaries, will be limited
to 65% of the voting capital stock of each direct foreign subsidiary owned by us or our domestic subsidiaries). The
senior notes will be effectively subordinated to all such secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of such
collateral. If we become insolvent or are liquidated, or if payment under the new senior secured credit facilities or
under the senior first lien notes offered hereby are accelerated, the lenders under the respective indebtedness will be
entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured lender under applicable law (in addition to any remedies that
may be available under documents pertaining to such indebtedness). If an event of default occurs under the new senior
secured credit facilities or under the indenture that will govern the senior first lien notes, the holders of such senior
secured indebtedness will have a prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of the holders of the senior notes, even if
we are in default with respect to the senior notes. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all
indebtedness and other obligations secured thereby (including all amounts outstanding under the new senior secured
credit facilities and the senior first lien notes), resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the
claims of the holders of the senior notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution
or payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or other bankruptcy
proceeding, holders of the senior notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with each other and with all
holders of our unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as the senior notes, and potentially with
all of our other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the
foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the senior notes. As
a result, holders of the senior notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of our secured indebtedness.

As of November 1, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the senior notes and
the related note guarantees would have ranked effectively junior to approximately $3,500 million of secured
indebtedness, and we would have an additional $750.0 million of anticipated availability under the new ABL facility
(without giving effect to the $62.0 million of letters of credit currently outstanding under the existing ABL facility
that are expected to remain outstanding under the new ABL facility), subject to a borrowing base. As of November 1,
2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor would have
had $4,650 million of indebtedness and $3,500 million of such indebtedness would have been secured. Under the
credit agreement that will govern the new ABL facility we may also request to increase the revolving commitments
by up to $500.0 million under the new ABL facility, subject to certain conditions being satisfied. The indentures that
will govern the notes and the credit agreements that will govern the new senior secured credit facilities will permit us
to incur additional secured indebtedness.

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and/or the note guarantees and, if_**
**_that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes._**

Our creditors and the creditors of the guarantors of the notes could challenge the issuance of the notes or the
guarantors’ issuance of their note guarantees, respectively, as fraudulent conveyances or on other grounds. In addition,
the incurrence of the affiliate guarantee by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor may be subject to review under U.S.
federal bankruptcy law or relevant state fraudulent conveyance laws if a bankruptcy case or lawsuit is commenced by
or on behalf of the affiliate guarantors or its unpaid creditors, or by or on behalf of PetSmart or its unpaid creditors
(including as a result of the Chewy Equity Distribution) or the transferee of any Chewy common stock that is
substituted for Pledged Chewy Stock.

Under U.S. bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a court could void
the issuance of the notes and/or a note guarantee or claims related to the notes or subordinate a note guarantee to all
of our other debts or to all other debts of a guarantor if, among other things, we or a guarantor, at the time we or such
guarantor incurred the indebtedness:

    - intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or

    - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the delivery of the notes or
the guarantee, as the case may be, and if any Issuer or guarantor:

        - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

74


-----

        - was engaged in a business or transaction for which any Issuer’s or guarantor’s remaining
assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

        - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts
as they mature.

In addition, a court could void any payment by a guarantor pursuant to the notes or a note guarantee and
require that payment be returned to such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the guarantor. If the
notes or note guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any claim you may make
against the Issuers or the guarantors for amounts payable on the notes would be unenforceable to the extent of such
avoidance or limitation. Moreover, the court could order you to return any payments previously made by the Issuers
or the guarantors.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the governing
law in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a party would be
considered insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of
its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of all of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to
pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We cannot be certain what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or, regardless of the
standard, that a court would not avoid the notes or note guarantees. It may be asserted (and a court may consequently
determine) that the guarantors incurred their note guarantees for the Issuers’ benefit and did not themselves receive a
direct or indirect benefit from the issuance of the senior notes or the senior first lien notes, as the case may be, such
that they incurred the obligations under the note guarantees for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration.

The indentures that will govern the notes will contain a “savings clause” intended to limit each guarantor’s
liability under its guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the guarantee to be a fraudulent
transfer under applicable law. There can be no assurance that this provision will be upheld as intended.

lien notes due 2025.

(iv) $650.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding due under PetSmart’s 8.875% senior notes
due 2025.

Any remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. This offering memorandum shall not
constitute a notice of redemption with respect to any of the foregoing series of notes or a notice of repayment with
respect to the existing term loan facility, and any redemption of our existing notes or repayment of our existing term
loan facility will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant indenture or such existing term
loan facility, respectively.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may be holders of our existing notes and/or lenders under our
existing term loan facility and will receive a pro rata portion of the net proceeds from this offering used to refinance
such indebtedness. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are lenders and/or agents under our
existing ABL facility, new ABL facility, and new term loan facility and have received, or may in the future receive,
customary fees and commissions for transactions under such facilities. See “Plan of Distribution.”

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF PETSMART**

The unaudited pro forma financial data of PetSmart and its subsidiaries set forth below give effect to the
Transactions, including the Chewy Distribution.

The unaudited pro forma financial data as of November 1, 2020 reflects the Transactions and the use of
proceeds therefrom as if each occurred as if they had occurred on the last day preceding such twelve month period.
The unaudited pro forma statement of operations data for the twelve months ended November 1, 2020 reflect the
Transactions as if they had occurred on the last day preceding such twelve month period. The unaudited pro forma
balance sheet reflects the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom as if each occurred as if they had occurred
on November 1, 2020.

The unaudited pro forma financial data give effect to the Chewy Distribution under the equity method of
accounting. The adjustments necessary to fairly present the unaudited pro forma financial data have been made based
on available information and in the opinion of management are reasonable. Assumptions underlying the pro forma
adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with this unaudited pro
forma financial information.

Changes to the preliminary estimates set forth herein may have a significant impact on the pro forma amounts
of total assets, total liabilities and equity, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and income tax
expense. Such differences may be material.

The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the application of pro forma adjustments that are
(i) directly attributable to the Transactions, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) in the case of the unaudited pro forma
statement of operations data, expected to have a continuing impact on PetSmart’s consolidated financial results.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is for illustrative purposes only and
does not purport to represent what our financial position or results of operations actually would have been had the
events noted above in fact occurred on the assumed dates or to project our financial position or results of operations
for any future date or future period.

_references in this management’s discussion and analysis to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean PetSmart_
_and its consolidated subsidiaries, which, for the avoidance of doubt, do not include Chewy and its subsidiaries._

**Overview**

PetSmart is North America’s leading specialty provider of products, services and solutions for the lifetime
needs of pets. Since opening its first store in 1987, the Company has grown to operate 1,650 stores in the United States,
Puerto Rico and Canada as of November 1, 2020. PetSmart serves a large group of pet owners it calls “pet parents,”
customers who are passionately committed to their pets and consider them members of the family. The Company is
committed to developing moment-making products, services and experiences for pet parents, including inviting pet
parents to shop with their pets, which the Company believes creates an enjoyable and memorable shopping experience.
PetSmart stores carry a broad assortment of high-quality pet supplies for all the life stages of pets, including nationally
recognized brand names as well as an extensive selection of private brands, across a range of product categories. The
Company complements its extensive product assortment with a wide selection of services, including professional
grooming and boarding for cats and dogs, as well as training and day camp for dogs. Most stores feature pet styling
salons that provide high-quality grooming services for dogs, and many of the pet styling salons provide services for
cats.

We intend (i) to distribute substantially concurrently with consummation of this offering in connection with
the Refinancing Transactions, directly or indirectly, to Holdings and Holdings intends to distribute to its parent or one
of such parent’s subsidiaries all shares of Chewy common stock currently directly held by us and (ii) to distribute or
otherwise transfer substantially concurrently with or at any time following consummation of this offering, directly or
indirectly, to Holdings and Holdings intends to distribute or otherwise transfer to its parent or one of such parent’s
subsidiaries the equity interests of one or more of our wholly owned subsidiaries that operate a portion of Chewy’s
online pet pharmacy business and/or the assets of any such subsidiary. Following completion of the Chewy
Distribution, we will not own any shares of Chewy common stock. Accordingly, neither Chewy nor any subsidiary of
Chewy will be a subsidiary of PetSmart. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information of PetSmart.” This
management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation includes the historical results of
operations of PetSmart on a consolidated basis (inclusive of Chewy), as well as the historical results of operations of
PetSmart excluding Chewy. Any discussion of PetSmart excluding Chewy does not purport to represent the results of
operations or financial position that PetSmart would actually obtain on a standalone basis if the Chewy Distribution
occurred at any date, nor does such discussion purport to project the results of operations for any future period.

A portion of the online pet pharmacy activity of Chewy.com legally resides within a wholly-owned subsidiary
of PetSmart, Inc. (the “Pharmacy Subsidiary”) outside of Chewy, Inc. We have combined the financial results of the
Pharmacy Subsidiary with the financial results of Chewy, Inc. since Chewy, Inc. operates the entire online pet
pharmacy business of Chewy.com, including the Pharmacy Subsidiary. We refer to Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries
plus the Pharmacy Subsidiary, collectively as “Chewy.” The Pharmacy Subsidiary and Chewy, Inc. are also parties to
a services agreement that provides for the payment of a management fee by the Pharmacy Subsidiary to Chewy, Inc.

83


-----

for services Chewy, Inc. provides to the Pharmacy Subsidiary. Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, Chewy, Inc.
is entitled to receive an amount equal to 25% of the Pharmacy Subsidiary’s net sales as fees for the services that it
provides to the Pharmacy Subsidiary. This management fee is eliminated in the combined Chewy financial results as
well as the condensed consolidated results for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 and
November 3, 2019 and the Company’s consolidated results for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 of the Company
herein. We refer to our condensed consolidated results for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020
and November 3, 2019 and the consolidated results for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018, excluding Chewy, herein
as “PetSmart.” Substantially concurrently with or at any time following consummation of this offering, we intend to
distribute or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly, to Holdings and Holdings intends to distribute or otherwise
transfer to its parent the equity interests or assets of the Pharmacy Subsidiary following consummation of the other
Transactions. Following completion of the Chewy Equity Distribution, we will not own any shares of Chewy common
stock and following the Pharmacy Distribution we will not own or have any economic or other interest in the Pharmacy
Subsidiary.

We complement our extensive product assortment with a wide selection of services, including professional
grooming and boarding for cats and dogs, as well as training and day camp for dogs. All of our stores feature pet
styling salons that provide high-quality grooming services for dogs, and many of our pet styling salons provide
services for cats. Several of our stores feature self-serve dog washes, and most of our stores offer comprehensive dog
training services. Our PetsHotels provide boarding for dogs and most of our PetsHotels provide boarding for cats.
This includes 24-hour supervision by caregivers who are trained to provide personalized pet care, temperaturecontrolled rooms and suites, air purification systems, daily specialty treats and play time, as well as day camp for
dogs. As of November 1, 2020 and February 2, 2020, we operated 207 and 208 PetsHotels, respectively.

We make full-service veterinary care available through strategic relationships with third-party operators. As
of November 1, 2020 and February 2, 2020, we had full-service veterinary hospitals in 809 and 848 of our stores,
respectively, of which 799 and 839, respectively, were operated by Medical Management International, Inc., which
does business as Banfield, The Pet Hospital. The remaining hospitals were operated by other third-parties. In addition,
we offer low cost vaccination and microchipping for dogs and cats through a third-party vaccination clinic provider
in many of our stores on a periodic basis.

The principal challenges we face as a business include the highly competitive market in which we operate
and volatility in the macro-economy. However, we believe we have a competitive advantage through our in-store and
online solutions for pet parents, which cannot be easily duplicated, including differentiated products and services for
pets, merchandising capabilities, omni-channel experience, and exceptional customer service as well as a growing
assortment and selection of private and exclusive brands and services. The recent outbreak of COVID-19, which was
declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 (the “Pandemic”), has led to adverse
impacts on the U.S. and global economies. While the sale of pet food and other merchandise for pets has generally
been considered essential, the Pandemic has created some supply chain challenges, including inventory shortages of
certain items and longer delivery times for online customers, as well as operational challenges, including those related
to accommodating social distancing guidelines required by various government orders. In particular, our services
business has been adversely impacted by government orders that prohibit or limit services we can provide, social
distancing guidelines that limit our capacity, and less demand for certain services due to reduced travel and more time
being spent at home. These and other effects of the Pandemic, including uncertainty in consumer demand, could
adversely impact our business in the future.

Nearly all of our stores remained opened during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020. We
temporarily reduced our hours of operations in April for all of our stores; however, during the thirteen weeks ended
August 2, 2020, we began adding back these hours with most of our stores returning to normal hours of operations as
of November 1, 2020. Beginning on April 5, 2020 approximately half of our Canada stores were only open for online
orders shipped from stores and curbside pickup. On May 19, 2020, these Canadian stores reopened for in-store
transactions. These stores were again limited to online orders shipped from stores and curbside pickup beginning on
December 26, 2020 under an order that remains in place as of the date hereof. In addition, effective March 21, 2020,
we elected to temporarily suspend all grooming services for approximately two weeks in response to the Pandemic.
After this period, and following an evaluation of our grooming business and several changes to our processes, we
began to reopen our grooming operations where allowable under state and local orders. As of November 1, 2020,
nearly all of our grooming salons had reopened, however, a small percentage have been required to close under local

84


-----

orders, mostly in California and Canada, since that time. Our pet training services were closed from the start of the
Pandemic until June 8, 2020 when these services began to reopen where allowable under state and local orders.
However, class sizes were reduced to allow for social distancing. As of November 1, 2020, pet training services had
resumed in most of our stores. Substantially all of our PetsHotels were closed from the start of the Pandemic through
May 20, 2020 when these services began to reopen where allowable under state and local orders and in markets with
sufficient demand. The majority of PetsHotels had re-opened as of November 1, 2020.

We continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our operations as may
be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates,
customers, suppliers, vendors and the overall business. While the disruption is currently expected to be temporary,
there is uncertainty regarding its duration, and it is possible that the Pandemic could worsen. Any such disruptions or
worsening of the Pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

- Comparable Sales were calculated on an equivalent 52-week basis for 2019, by comparing the 52-weeks for 2018 had
it began on February 5, 2018. Comparable Sales and Constant Currency Comparable Sales for 2019 compared to 2018,
were as follows:

**Constant Currency**

**Comparable Sales** **Comparable Sales**

**2019** **2018**
PetSmart ...................................................................... 0.0% 0.1%
Chewy .......................................................................... 42.6% 42.6%
Consolidated ................................................................ 14.0% 14.1%

- Services sales increased 1.1% to $891.8 million in 2019, compared to $881.7 million in 2018. The extra week in 2018
resulted in additional services sales of $14.7 million.

- Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 25.7% in 2019, compared to 25.9% in 2018.

- Excluding Chewy and the impact of the change in our vendor allowance terms in 2018, PetSmart’s gross profit as a
percentage of net sales decreased 110 basis points to 32.9% in 2019, compared to 34.0% in 2018. PetSmart’s gross
profit as a percentage of net sales in 2018 included a favorable 20 basis points attributable to the extra week.

- Chewy’s gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 350 basis points to 15.2% in 2019, compared to 11.7% in
2018. The extra week in 2018 was not material to Chewy’s gross profit.

- As of February 2, 2020, we had $760.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. On February 10, 2020,
after the end of the fiscal year, we paid $3.4 million, exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest, for the repurchase of a
portion of our 2025 senior first lien notes, and made an additional principal prepayment of Consenting Term Loans,
at par, in an aggregate amount of $58.6 million (exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest). We did not borrow against
the existing ABL facility or Chewy’s ABL Facility during 2019 or 2018.

- The recent outbreak of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11,
2020, has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies. While the pet-related industry continues to be
viewed as essential, the pandemic has created uncertainty regarding potential impacts to our supply chain, operations,
and customer demand. The pandemic has impacted and could further impact our operations and the operations of our
suppliers and vendors as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the judgments
and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may deviate from our expectations under different
assumptions or conditions, which could expose us to material gains or losses.

Unless specifically indicated below, we have not significantly changed accounting methodologies or
assumptions applied in calculating our estimates during the last three years. We do not believe there are any specific
sensitivities of our estimates and assumptions that are reasonably likely to cause a material difference between
expected results and actual results.

We determined that the following accounting policies and estimates require significant judgment and are
critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Further, as of November 1, 2020, we have not made any
significant changes to our critical accounting policies since February 2, 2020.

**_Inventory Valuation Reserves_**

Merchandise inventories represent finished goods and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
We use a combination of the moving average cost method and the first-in first-out (FIFO) method when determining
the value of inventory. Inventory balances include inbound freight and customs fees on imported products.

We have established reserves for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventories. Physical
inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in our stores and inventory is adjusted accordingly. Stores generally
perform physical inventories at least once per year and count certain inventory items between physical inventories.
Distribution and fulfillment centers perform cycle counts on a regular basis. For each reporting period presented, we
estimate the inventory shrinkage based on historical trends. Changes in shrink results or market conditions could cause
actual results to vary from estimates used to establish the reserves.

We also have reserves for estimated inventory obsolescence and to reduce merchandise inventory to the lower
of cost or net realizable value. We evaluate inventory for excess, obsolescence, or other factors that may render
inventories unmarketable at historical cost. Factors used in determining obsolescence reserves, which are recorded to
reflect approximate net realizable value of our inventories, include current and anticipated demand, customer
preferences, age of merchandise, seasonal trends, and decisions to discontinue certain products. If assumptions about
future demand change, or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, we may
require additional reserves.

As of November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, our inventory valuation reserves were $18.7 million and
$22.9 million, respectively.

**_Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets_**

Goodwill consists of the excess of the consideration transferred to the acquired enterprises over the sum of
the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment
annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have determined the
consolidated reporting entity to have the following two operating units which also represent two separate reporting
units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment: PetSmart and Chewy.

We may elect to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value
of our reporting units is less than the carrying amount prior to performing a quantitative impairment test. If this is the
case, a quantitative impairment test is required. If it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is

88


-----

not less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required. If a quantitative impairment test is
required, or if we choose to bypass the optional qualitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared
to its carrying amount (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then
a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its
fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit under the quantitative impairment test is determined using a combination
of valuation methodologies, including a discounted cash flow analysis, a guideline public company analysis, and a
guideline transaction analysis. No goodwill impairments were identified for 2019, 2018, or 2017.

When evaluating indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired. In performing
this qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that
impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and
circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, we are required to calculate the fair value
of the intangible asset group.

Our impairment analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and
to apply judgment to qualitative factors as well as estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting
prospective financial information and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.

No impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets were identified in 2019. For 2018, we recognized
impairment charges totaling $269.4 million related to the indefinite-lived trade name of PetSmart. For 2017, we
recognized impairment charges totaling $405.5 million related to the indefinite-lived trade names of PetSmart and our
wholly-owned subsidiary, Pet360.

**_Long-lived Asset Impairments_**

We review property and equipment for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows on a quarterly basis
and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. If this review indicates that the carrying amount of the property and equipment is not recoverable, we
recognize an impairment loss, which is determined by calculating the fair value of the assets using estimated
discounted cash flows. We recognized impairment charges for property and equipment of $13.0 million, $4.8 million,
and $5.5 million related to under-performing stores, stores that were scheduled to be closed, and natural disasters for
2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If this review
indicates that the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible assets is not recoverable, we recognize an
impairment loss, which is measured at fair value using estimated discounted cash flows. Our impairment analyses
contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimated
future cash flows and asset fair values.

No material impairments of our definite-lived intangible assets were identified in 2019 or 2018. For 2017,
we recognized an impairment charge of $6.3 million primarily related to the definite-lived intangible assets of Pet360.

**_Customer Loyalty Program_**

During the third quarter of 2018, we completed the implementation of a customer loyalty program, PetSmart
Treats, in which members earn points primarily based on purchases in our stores and on PetSmart.com. The points
earned are a distinct promise from the original purchase that can be exchanged for future goods or services, which
creates a performance obligation for the Company to provide goods or services until those points are redeemed or
expire.

The Company allocates revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defers recognition until the
points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which
includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed. The estimated redemption rate is based on historical

89


-----

experience and other assumptions. The estimates are evaluated on an on-going basis. The Company defers the value
of points earned that are estimated to be redeemed at the time of the initial purchase in other current liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets until the points are redeemed. As of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, deferred
revenue related to the PetSmart Treats program was $29.5 million and $19.9 million, respectively.

**_Insurance Liabilities and Reserves_**

We maintain workers’ compensation, general liability, product liability, property insurance and other types
of insurance policies related to our operations, properties, and leasehold interests. For some associates, we maintain
full coverage health insurance plans. For all other eligible associates, we maintain self-insured health plans. Workers’
compensation policies generally carry a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible exposure. Our general liability policies
specify a $1.0 million per occurrence self-insured retention. We establish reserves for claims under workers’
compensation and general liability plans based on periodic actuarial estimates of the amount of loss for all pending
claims, including estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported. Our loss estimates rely on actuarial
observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events, and changes in such assumptions could result in
an adjustment, favorable or adverse, to our reserves. As of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, we had
approximately $81.7 million and $79.6 million, respectively, in reserves related to workers’ compensation, general
liability, and self-insured health plans, of which $46.9 million and $48.1 million were classified as other noncurrent
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A 10% change in our insurance reserves would have affected net
income by approximately $6.7 million for 2019.

**_Income Taxes_**

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred taxes are
measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the assets or liabilities are expected to be realized.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for any portion that is not more likely than not to be realized.

The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
as income tax expense.

As of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, our unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $31.9
million and $31.7 million, respectively.

**_Leases_**

We adopted the new Lease Standard under ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as of the first day of fiscal
year 2019. Under the Lease Standard, our accounting for leases may involve significant assumptions and judgments
to identify the underlying real estate space or equipment subject to the lease and the incremental borrowing rate used
to discount the lease obligation over the lease term. We record operating and finance lease right of use, or ROU, assets
based on the sum of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for initial direct costs and lease incentives.
We measure the operating and finance lease obligations based on the present value of the future lease payments over
the lease term at the commencement date. The initial measurement of the ROU assets and lease obligations include
fixed payments included in our lease agreements. We elected the practical expedient to account for each separate lease
component and non-lease component associated with our leases as a single lease component for real estate leases.
Rental payments are recognized as a reduction of the operating and finance lease obligations. Operating lease expense
is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We depreciate finance lease ROU assets over the term of the
lease and recognize the related interest expense. We recognize lease payments of short-term leases on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Adjustments to lease payments due to inflation subsequent to lease commencement are
recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.

**Thirteen Weeks Ended November 1, 2020, Compared to the Thirteen Weeks Ended November 3, 2019**

**_Net Sales_**

Net sales increased $781.7 million, or 25.8%, for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020 compared to
the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in Chewy’s net sales
and PetSmart’s merchandise sales, partially offset by a decrease in PetSmart’s services sales. During the thirteen
weeks ended November 1, 2020, PetSmart’s net sales included an unfavorable impact from foreign currency
fluctuations of $0.2 million compared to a $2.1 million unfavorable impact during the thirteen weeks ended November
3, 2019.

**Net Sales (in millions)**
**Thirteen Weeks Ended** **Thirteen Weeks Ended**

**November 1, 2020** **November 3, 2019**

PetSmart ................................................................... $ 1,998.9 $ 1,765.3
Chewy ....................................................................... 1,807.7 1,259.6
Consolidated ............................................................. $ 3,806.6 $ 3,024.9

Comparable Sales and Constant Currency Comparable Sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020,
compared to the same fiscal period in the previous year, were as follows:

**Constant Currency**

**Comparable Sales** **Comparable Sales**

**Thirteen Weeks Ended** **Thirteen Weeks Ended**

PetSmart ................................................................... 13.8% 13.7%
Chewy ....................................................................... 43.5% 43.5%
Consolidated ............................................................. 26.2% 26.2%

Merchandise sales were 95.1% and 92.5% of net sales for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020 and
November 3, 2019, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in Chewy’s net sales, an
increase in PetSmart’s merchandise sales, particularly within our hardgoods and specialty categories, and offset by a
decrease in services sales. The following table presents the percent of net sales of each merchandise category for the
thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019:


**Thirteen Weeks Ended**
**November 1, 2020** **November 3, 2019**
Merchandise Category
Consumables ............................................................. 61.0% 61.6%
Hardgoods................................................................. 24.6% 22.4%
Specialty ................................................................... 9.5% 8.5%

PetSmart’s merchandise Comparable Sales increased 18.1% during the thirteen weeks ended November 1,
2020 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2019.

Services sales, which include professional grooming and boarding for cats and dogs, as well as training and
day camp for dogs, decreased 17.8% to $176.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020, compared to
$214.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2019. The decrease in services sales was primarily
attributable to the Pandemic as discussed above within Overview.

PetSmart’s services Comparable Sales decreased 17.5% during the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020
compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2019.

Other revenue included in net sales primarily represents sublease income, reimbursements for specific
operating expenses charged to third-party veterinary offices located within many of our stores under our agreements

with them, and gift card breakage. Other revenue as a percentage of net sales was 0.3% and 0.4% for the thirteen
weeks ended November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, respectively.

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 150 basis points to 26.6% for the thirteen weeks ended
November 1, 2020, compared to 25.1% for the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2019.

Excluding Chewy, PetSmart’s gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 300 basis points to 35.3%
for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020, compared to 32.3% for the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2019.
The increase was primarily driven by leveraging of occupancy costs, strong performance in our higher margin
hardgoods and specialty merchandise categories, and a decrease in promotional activities, partially offset by the impact
of the Pandemic on our services margin during the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020.

Chewy’s gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 180 basis points to 16.9% for the thirteen weeks
ended November 1, 2020, compared to 15.1% for the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2019. The increase was
primarily due to margin expansion across all verticals.

**_Operating, General, and Administrative Expenses_**

Operating, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 200 basis points to
22.2% for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020, compared to 24.2% for the thirteen weeks ended November
3, 2019.

During the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, PetSmart incurred one-time costs
of $17.6 million and $35.9 million, respectively. In addition, included in PetSmart’s operating, general, and
administrative expenses for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020 were $8.3 million of costs specifically
attributable to the Pandemic. Excluding Chewy, one-time costs, and costs attributable to the Pandemic, PetSmart’s
operating, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were flat for the thirteen weeks ended
November 1, 2020 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2019. This was comprised of reductions and
leveraging of certain store payroll related costs and other expenses during the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020,
which were offset by an increase in incentive-based compensation accruals commensurate with our stronger
performance as well as losses accrued for non-cash foreign exchange translations during the thirteen weeks ended
November 1, 2020.

Excluding one-time costs, Chewy’s operating, general, and administrative expenses increased $67.0 million
for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2019. The increase
was primarily driven by increased headcount as a result of Chewy’s business growth as well as expenses incurred as
a result of information technology initiatives and operating as a public company. In addition, Chewy’s advertising
expense increased for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020 compared to the thirteen weeks ended November
3, 2019; however, the advertising spend declined as a percentage of Chewy’s net sales. These increases were partially
offset by a reduction in equity compensation.

**_Interest Expense, net_**

Interest expense, net, was $110.5 million and $132.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020
and November 3, 2019, respectively, and was comprised of the following (in millions):

**Thirteen Weeks Ended**
**November 1, 2020** **November 3, 2019**
Interest incurred on existing credit facilities (1) ....... $ 97.4 $ 118.1
Amortization of debt discounts and deferred
issuance costs related to existing credit facilities ..... 8.1 9.2
Other interest expense, primarily related to finance
lease obligations ....................................................... 5.3 6.6

Interest income ......................................................... (0.3) (1.5)
Total interest expense, net ........................................ $ 110.5 $ 132.4

(1) The decrease in interest incurred on our existing credit facilities was primarily due to principal prepayments
made on the existing term loan facility and the repurchases of 2025 senior first lien notes as well as the
decrease in the interest rate on the existing term loan facility. See discussion on existing credit facilities in
Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

**_Income Tax Benefit_**

Income tax benefit was $27.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020, representing an
effective tax rate of 36.6%, compared to an income tax benefit of $18.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended November
3, 2019, representing an effective tax rate of 17.9%. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to deferred
taxes related to our investment in Chewy, Inc.

**Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended November 1, 2020, Compared to the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended November 3, 2019**

**_Net Sales_**

Net sales increased $2,024.8 million, or 22.7%, for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 compared
to the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in Chewy’s net
sales and PetSmart’s merchandise sales, partially offset by a decrease in PetSmart’s services sales. During the thirtynine weeks ended November 1, 2020, PetSmart’s net sales included an unfavorable impact from foreign currency
fluctuations of $7.5 million compared to a $10.4 million unfavorable impact during the thirty-nine weeks ended
November 3, 2019.

Merchandise sales were 95.5% and 92.1% of net sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020
and November 3, 2019, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in Chewy’s net sales, an
increase in PetSmart’s merchandise sales, particularly within our hardgoods and specialty categories, and a decrease
in services sales. The following table presents the percent of net sales of each merchandise category for the thirty-nine
weeks ended November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019:

2020 compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019.

Services sales, which include professional grooming and boarding for cats and dogs, as well as training and
day camp for dogs, decreased 31.8% to $456.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, compared
to $668.3 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019. The decrease in services sales was primarily
attributable to the Pandemic as discussed above within Overview.

PetSmart’s services Comparable Sales decreased 31.2% during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1,
2020 compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019.

Other revenue included in net sales primarily represents sublease income, reimbursements for specific
operating expenses charged to third-party veterinary offices located within many of our stores under our agreements
with them, and gift card breakage. Other revenue as a percentage of net sales was 0.3% and 0.4% for the thirty-nine
weeks ended November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, respectively.

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 70 basis points to 26.3% for the thirty-nine weeks ended
November 1, 2020, compared to 25.6% for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019.

Excluding Chewy, PetSmart’s gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 250 basis points to 35.3%
for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, compared to 32.8% for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3,
2019. The increase was primarily driven by leveraging of occupancy costs, strong performance in our higher margin
hardgoods and specialty merchandise categories, and a decrease in promotional activities, partially offset by the impact
of the Pandemic on our services margin during thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020.

Chewy’s gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 140 basis points to 16.3% for the thirty-nine
weeks ended November 1, 2020, compared to 14.9% for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019. The increase
was primarily due to margin expansion across hardgoods, pharmacy and private brands.

**_Operating, General, and Administrative Expenses_**

Operating, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 140 basis points to
22.1% for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, compared to 23.5% for the thirty-nine weeks ended
November 3, 2019.

During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, PetSmart incurred one-time
costs of $68.7 million and $89.9 million, respectively. In addition, included in PetSmart’s operating, general, and
administrative expenses for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 were $42.5 million of costs specifically
attributable to the Pandemic. Excluding Chewy, one-time costs, and costs attributable to the Pandemic, PetSmart’s
operating, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points for the thirtynine weeks ended November 1, 2020 compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019. The decrease was
primarily attributable to reductions and leveraging of advertising, certain store payroll related costs, and other expenses
during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020. These were partially offset by an increase in incentive-based
compensation accruals commensurate with our stronger performance during the thirty-nine weeks ended November
1, 2020.

Excluding one-time costs, Chewy’s operating, general, and administrative expenses increased $232.1 million

95


-----

for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019. The
increase was primarily driven by an increase in equity compensation, expansion of Chewy’s corporate office and
increased headcount as a result of business growth, and an increase in expenses incurred due to operating as a public
company. In addition, Chewy’s advertising expense increased for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020
compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019; however, the advertising spend declined as a percentage
of Chewy’s net sales.

**_Interest Expense, net_**

Interest expense, net, was $347.1 million and $417.5 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1,
2020 and November 3, 2019, respectively, and was comprised of the following (in millions):

**Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**
**November 1, 2020** **November 3, 2019**
Interest incurred on existing credit facilities (1) ....... $ 304.5 $ 375.9
Amortization of debt discounts and deferred
issuance costs related to existing credit facilities ..... 25.2 25.6
Other interest expense, primarily related to finance
lease obligations ....................................................... 19.3 20.9
Interest income ......................................................... (1.9) (4.9)
Total interest expense, net ........................................ $ 347.1 $ 417.5

(1) The decrease in interest incurred on our existing credit facilities was primarily due to principal prepayments
made on the existing term loan facility and the repurchases of 2025 senior first lien notes as well as the
decrease in the interest rate on the existing term loan facility. See discussion on existing credit facilities in
Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

**_Income Tax Benefit_**

Income tax benefit was $146.3 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, representing an
effective tax rate of 48.4%, compared to an income tax benefit of $51.7 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended
November 3, 2019, representing an effective tax rate of 21.0%. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily
due to deferred taxes related to our investment in Chewy, Inc.

**2019 (52-weeks) Compared to 2018 (53-weeks)**

**_Net Sales_**

Net sales increased $1,320.7 million, or 12.2%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was driven by
Chewy’s net sales, partially offset by a decrease in PetSmart’s net sales. For 2019, PetSmart’s net sales included an
unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations of $9.0 million compared to a $4.6 million unfavorable impact
for 2018. The extra week in 2018 resulted in additional net sales of $132.4 million and $85.4 million for PetSmart and
Chewy, respectively. Net sales in 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions):

**Net Sales**
**2019** **2018**
PetSmart ..................................................................................... $7,193.8 $7,271.2
Chewy ......................................................................................... 4,969.6 3,571.6
Consolidated ............................................................................... $12,163.4 $10,842.7

Comparable Sales were calculated on an equivalent 52-week basis for 2019, by comparing the 52-weeks for
2018 had it began on February 5, 2018. Comparable Sales and Constant Currency Comparable Sales for 2019
compared to 2018, were as follows:

**Constant Currency**

**Comparable Sales** **Comparable Sales**

**2019** **2019**
PetSmart ..................................................................................... 0.0% 0.1%
Chewy ......................................................................................... 42.6% 42.6%
Consolidated ............................................................................... 14.0% 14.1%

Merchandise sales were 92.3% and 91.4% of net sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was
primarily attributable to an increase in Chewy’s net sales. The following table presents the percent of net sales of each
merchandise category for 2019 and 2018:

**Merchandise Category** **2019** **2018**
Consumables ............................................................................... 60.7% 58.0%
Hardgoods ................................................................................... 22.9% 24.3%
Specialty ..................................................................................... 8.7% 9.1%

Services sales, which include professional grooming and boarding for cats and dogs, as well as training and
day camp for dogs, increased 1.1% to $891.8 million in 2019, compared to $881.7 million in 2018. The extra week in
2018 resulted in additional services sales of $14.7 million. The increase in services sales was primarily attributable to
sales from our PetsHotels and training.

Other revenue included in net sales primarily represents sublease income, reimbursements for specific
operating expenses charged to third-party veterinary offices located within many of our stores under our agreements

with them, and beginning in 2019, gift card breakage. Other revenue as a percentage of net sales was 0.4% and 0.5%
in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The extra week in 2018 did not have a material impact on other revenue.

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 25.7% in 2019, compared to 25.9% in
2018. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, in connection with our annual vendor negotiations, PetSmart made changes to
certain merchandise vendor contracts which allow us greater flexibility in the way we use certain vendor allowances.
As a result of these changes, these vendor allowances are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of our inventory
and, therefore, are ultimately recognized as a reduction to cost of merchandise sales on our Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Loss when the inventory is sold. Under our vendor contracts prior to fiscal year
2018, these vendor allowances were recognized as a direct reduction to either cost of merchandise sales or operating,
general, and administrative expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss,
depending on the nature of the underlying activities. As a result, we experienced a lag in the timing of recognizing
vendor funding during fiscal year 2018 as we sold through inventory purchased prior to fiscal year 2018. The estimated
impact of this timing lag was $77.1 million for 2018 when comparing to 2019.

Excluding Chewy and the $77.1 million timing lag in 2018 as a result of the change in our vendor allowances
terms, PetSmart’s gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 110 basis points to 32.9% for 2019 compared to
34.0% for 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by merchandise cost increases. PetSmart’s gross profit as a
percentage of net sales in 2018 included a favorable 20 basis points attributable to the extra week in 2018.

Chewy’s gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 350 basis points to 15.2% for 2019 compared to
11.7% for 2018. The increase was primarily driven by margin expansion across all verticals, including improvements
in margin profits of pharmacy and private brands. The extra week in 2018 was not material to Chewy’s gross profit.

**_Operating, General, and Administrative Expenses_**

Operating, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 230 basis points to
23.2% for 2019, compared to 25.5% for 2018. Included in PetSmart’s operating, general, and administrative expenses
for 2019 were $105.2 million of one-time costs. Included in PetSmart’s operating, general, and administrative
expenses for 2018 were $269.4 million related to the PetSmart trade name impairment and $51.0 million of other onetime costs. Excluding Chewy and one-time costs, PetSmart’s operating, general, and administrative expenses
increased 10 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in payroll
related costs, including certain store labor, partially offset by a decrease in recurring advertising expense. The extra
week in 2018 increased operating, general, and administrative expenses for PetSmart by $26.9 million.

Excluding one-time costs, Chewy’s operating, general, and administrative expenses increased $306.7 million
in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in equity compensation and an increase
in compensation and facilities expense related to expansion of Chewy’s corporate office and increased headcount as
a result of business growth and also in contemplation of becoming a public company, as well as investments in security
and data protection software. In addition, Chewy’s advertising expense increased in 2019 compared to 2018; however,
the advertising spend declined as a percentage of Chewy’s net sales. The extra week in 2018 increased operating,
general, and administrative expenses for Chewy by $20.5 million.

**_Interest Expense, net_**

Interest expense, net, was $545.9 million and $554.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The extra week
in 2018 increased interest expense, net, by $10.1 million. Interest expense, net, was comprised of the following (in
millions):

**2019** **2018**
**(52-weeks)** **(53-weeks)**
Interest incurred on existing credit facilities (1) ............................... $490.2 $494.3

-----

Amortization of debt discounts and deferred issuance costs related
to existing credit facilities ................................................................. 34.6 27.3
Other interest expense, primarily related to finance lease
obligations ........................................................................................ 27.3 36.1
Interest income ................................................................................. (6.2) (3.7)
Total interest expense, net ................................................................ $545.9 $554.0

(1) The decrease in interest incurred on our existing credit facilities was primarily due to the extra week in
2018 as well as the principal prepayments made on the existing term loan facility and the repurchases of the
2025 senior first lien notes during 2019. These were partially offset by the increase in the variable interest
rate on borrowings under our existing term loan. See discussion on existing credit facilities in Note 10 to
our consolidated financial statements.

**_Income Tax Benefit_**

Income tax benefit was $23.8 million in 2019, representing an effective tax rate of 9.2%, compared to an
income tax benefit of $113.9 million in 2018, representing an effective tax rate of 22.4%. The decrease in our effective
tax rate was primarily driven by deferred taxes recorded related to our investment in Chewy, Inc. The effective tax
rate is calculated by dividing our income tax benefit by loss before income tax benefit.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Cash Flow_**

As part of our new senior secured credit facilities, PetSmart expects to have access to a $750.0 million
revolving credit facility (without giving effect to the $62.0 million of letters of credit currently outstanding under the
existing ABL facility that are expected to remain outstanding under the new ABL facility), subject to a borrowing
base.

Our new senior secured credit facilities will contain customary representations, warranties, affirmative and
negative covenants, and events of default and cross-default. The negative covenants will include restrictions on our
ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, make investments, give
guarantees, sell assets, merge, or consolidate. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

We believe that our operating cash flow and cash on hand will be adequate to meet our recurring operating,
investing, and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, on March 18, 2020, after the end of fiscal year
2019, we borrowed $300.0 million under the existing ABL facility as a precautionary action due to the risks and
uncertainty caused by the Pandemic. We did not use any of these funds, and as such we repaid the $300.0 million in
full during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020. PetSmart has significant cash on hand and has access to
the remaining borrowing capacity under the existing ABL facility through December 2021, subject to a borrowing
base. There can be no assurance of our ability to access credit markets after the consummation of this offering on
commercially acceptable terms in the future. We continuously assess the economic environment and market conditions
to guide our decisions regarding our uses of cash, including capital expenditures, investments, dividends, and longterm debt requirements. Additionally, we continue to actively monitor the Pandemic and may take further actions that
alter our operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests
of our associates, customers, suppliers, vendors and shareholders. As a result, the Pandemic may continue to have an
impact on our results of operations, which could include decreases to our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow in
fiscal year 2021.

We typically fund our operations, new stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, PetsHotel openings, store
refurbishments, and other initiatives with cash generated by operating activities. Receipts from our sales come from
cash, checks and third-party debit and credit cards, and provide a significant source of liquidity. Cash flow from
operating activities fluctuates seasonally due to factors such as timing of holidays, the build-up of inventory for new
fulfillment centers, and the subsequent payment for that inventory. Cash is primarily used in operating activities to
fund procurement of merchandise inventories and other assets, net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities,
as well as service interest on our indebtedness.

-----

Net cash provided by operating activities was $736.2 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1,
2020 compared to $92.3 million of net cash used in operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3,
2019. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily driven by overall improvement in financial
performance as well as a reduction of interest paid on our Credit Facilities during the current year. Included in
operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 was net cash provided by operating activities
attributable to Chewy of $57.6 million compared to net cash used in operating activities attributable to Chewy of $32.4
million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $154.3 million and $556.6 million in 2019 and 2018,
respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities between 2019 and 2018 was primarily driven by
the build-up of inventory at PetSmart during 2019, an increase in income taxes paid, and other changes in net working
capital. The build-up of inventory at PetSmart was the result of our major store reset and investing in longer lead time
inventory. Included in operating activities in 2019 and 2018 was net cash provided by operating activities attributable
to Chewy of $36.4 million and $7.6 million, respectively.

Net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of expenditures for opening new facilities,
reformatting existing stores, supporting our business transformation initiatives, implementing performance upgrades
for aged and obsolete software, continuing our growth plans, and other strategic initiatives. Net cash used in investing
activities was $162.1 million and $133.2 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 and November 3,
2019, respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by capital expenditures
related to the launch of Chewy’s new fulfillment centers and a customer service center, partially offset by proceeds
received by PetSmart for the sale of property and equipment.

Net cash used in investing activities was $173.0 million and $200.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The primary driver of the decrease in net cash used in investing activities between 2019 and 2018 was a decrease in
cash paid for property and equipment, primarily as a result of fewer new store openings for PetSmart during 2019.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $214.9 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1,
2020 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $162.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended
November 3, 2019. Cash provided by financing activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 was
primarily attributable to $535.2 million in proceeds received from the Forward Contract and $318.4 million in net
proceeds received from Chewy’s equity offering in September 2020, partially offset by $594.8 million in cash
principal payments for our existing term loan facility and $46.5 million in cash payments of finance lease obligations.
Cash provided by financing activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019 was primarily attributable
to $1,110.3 million in net proceeds received from the sale of Chewy common stock as part of initial public offering
of Chewy. This was partially offset by $637.2 million in cash principal payments for our existing term loan facility,
$205.0 million in cash principal payments for our 5.875% Notes, $58.9 million in payments of finance lease
obligations, and $41.5 million in cash payments for Amendment 3 to our existing term loan facility.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $269.8 million in 2019, which primarily consisted of $1,398.2
million in net proceeds received from the sale of Chewy common stock as part of the initial public offering of Chewy
and the Rule 144 Transactions (as defined in the notes to our consolidated financial statements). This was partially
offset by $827.9 million in cash principal payments for our existing term loan facility, $205.0 million in cash principal
payments for our 2025 senior first lien notes, $72.1 million in payments of finance lease obligations, and $41.5 million
in cash payments for Amendment 3 to our existing term loan facility. Net cash used in financing activities was $173.6
million in 2018, which primarily consisted of payments for capital lease obligations and principal payments for our
existing term loan facility.

**_Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements_**

Nearly all of our stores are leased facilities. PetSmart closed 25 stores and opened 15 stores during the thirtynine weeks ended November 1, 2020. PetSmart opened 10 new stores and closed 10 stores in 2019. Generally, each
new store requires capital expenditures of approximately $0.7 million for fixtures, equipment, and leasehold
improvements, approximately $0.2 million for inventory, and approximately $0.1 million for pre-opening costs. In
addition, Chewy opened two new fulfillment centers in 2019.

Our ability to fund our operations and make planned capital expenditures depends on our future operating
performance and cash flow, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other
factors, some of which are beyond our control.

**_Lease and Other Obligations_**

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations, net of estimated sublease income, as of
February 2, 2020, and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future
periods (in thousands):

**2021 &** **2023 &** **2025 &**

**Contractual Obligation** **2020** **2022** **2024** **Beyond** **Other** **Total**

Operating lease obligations

(a) (b) ............................... $ 525,593 $ 907,750 $ 598,243 $ 815,677 $— $2,847,263
Finance lease obligations

(a) (b) ............................... 90,434 148,425 104,431 129,007 — 472,297

Insurance obligations (e) ....... 34,752 — — — 46,916 81,668
Total ...................................... $ 709,669 $ 1,091,439 $ 709,823 $ 944,684 $ 76,924 $ 3,532,539
Less: sublease income ...... (27,459) (42,177) (20,655) (4,879) — (95,170)
Net total ................................. $ 682,210 $1,049,262 $ 689,168 $ 939,805 $ 76,924 $3,437,369

(a) In addition to the commitments scheduled above, we have executed operating and finance lease agreements
with total minimum lease payments of $200.3 million. The typical lease term for these agreements is 10
years. These amounts are not included in the table above because we had not yet taken physical possession
of the property and equipment, and therefore, did not have the right to control the use of the property and
equipment under these leases as of February 2, 2020.
(b) Operating lease obligation and finance lease obligation include $870.2 million and $102.3 million in
interest, respectively.
(c) Represents minimum obligations primarily for advertising, product and service purchase commitments.
(d) Unrecognized tax benefits which have been recorded as liabilities, are included in “Other” as we are
uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled.
(e) Insurance obligations included in “Other” have been classified as noncurrent liabilities. We are unable to
estimate the specific year to which the obligations will relate beyond 2019.

**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**

We do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material current
or future impact on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital
resources.

**_Seasonality and Inflation_**

Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, notwithstanding the impact of the Pandemic. We
typically realize a slightly higher portion of net sales and operating profits during our fourth quarter, as compared to
our other quarters, due to increased holiday traffic. As a result of this seasonality, we believe that quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon
as indicators of future performance. Because our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area, sales may
also be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions, which are more prevalent for certain seasons of the year.
The timing of new store, PetsHotel, distribution or fulfillment center, and customer service center openings and related
preopening costs, the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores and PetsHotels, and the timing and
estimated obligations of facility closures, may cause our quarterly results of operations to fluctuate. Controllable
expenses could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter in a year. Finally, because new stores tend to experience higher

101


-----

payroll, advertising, and other store level expenses as a percentage of net sales as compared to mature stores, new
store openings also contribute to lower store operating margins until these stores become established.

While we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales
and results of operations are affected by both. We have been able to largely mitigate the effect by adjusting retail
prices accordingly. We can make no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the
future.

**BUSINESS**

**PetSmart Overview**

PetSmart is North America’s leading specialty provider of products, services and solutions for the lifetime
needs of pets. Since opening its first store in 1987, the Company has grown to operate 1,650 stores in the United
States, Puerto Rico and Canada as of November 1, 2020. PetSmart serves a large group of pet owners it calls “pet
parents,” customers who are passionately committed to their pets and consider them members of the family. The
Company is committed to developing moment-making products, services and experiences for pet parents, including
inviting pet parents to shop with their pets, which the Company believes creates an enjoyable and memorable shopping
experience.

PetSmart stores carry a broad assortment of high-quality pet supplies for all the life stages of pets, including
nationally recognized brand names as well as an extensive selection of private brands, across a range of product
categories. The Company complements its extensive product assortment with a wide selection of services, including
professional grooming and boarding for cats and dogs, as well as training and day camp for dogs. Most stores feature
pet styling salons that provide high-quality grooming services for dogs, and many of the pet styling salons provide
services for cats. The business generated $7.6 billion in pro forma net sales and $1,269.0 million in pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA for the twelve months ended November 1, 2020.

**_PetSmart at a Glance [(1) ]_**

(1) “Market share in specialty pet retail” includes only pet specialty channel per third-party estimates. “Mature stores” is defined as
locations that are five or more years old. Pro forma Free Cash Flow is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure; see “Summary—Summary
Historical and Pro Forma Financial and Other Data” for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure.

**_Retail Footprint_**

PetSmart has an extensive retail footprint with significant presence across the core U.S. market. Of its 1,650
stores, 91% are located in the U.S., with the remaining 9% in Canada and Puerto Rico. Stores are strategically located,
with a geographically diversified presence across favorable demographic profiles. For example, stores are in regions
with 1.5x the average U.S. household income and where population growth is expected to be 1.5x larger than recent

-----

historical rates in the U.S., based on U.S. census data. Furthermore, as of the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020, more
than 60% of PetSmart’s revenue was generated from stores with strong co-tenancy (a major retailer such as Target,
Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, Lowe’s or a grocer), which serves to enhance customer traffic in the area. Very few
stores are located in enclosed malls.

**_Recent Focus_**

The Company’s portfolio of stores generates strong margins and cash flows. Following acceleration of online
growth from Chewy and Amazon in 2016 and movement of two of the largest channel-exclusive brands into the Food,
Drug and Mass (“FDM”) channel in 2016 and 2017, PetSmart has shifted its strategy to focus on services, private
brands and specialty products as well as improved merchandising strategy to bring in new and growing brands to
enhance its value proposition to pet parents, which have provided PetSmart with a path to recovery and further growth.
As such, comparable sales have seen continuous sequential improvement over the last two years, reaching positive
comparable sales in the second half of fiscal year 2019 and accelerating through the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the
long-term, comparable sales continue to benefit from positive trends around new pet ownership, increased consumer
spending and continued humanization of pets.

PetSmart leverages growing omni-channel capabilities to enhance its leading brick and mortar position and
to meet the changing needs of customers. The omni-channel offering consists of BOPIS including curbside pickup,
STH, and SFS. PetSmart also has a partnership with DoorDash Inc., a digital delivery service provider, where the
Company partners to provide on-demand, same-day delivery service to customers across 1,618 retail locations.
Despite a number of e-commerce options available for pet parents throughout the pandemic, customers have continued
shopping at PetSmart whether in-store or through omni-channel offerings. The omni-channel strategy is focused on
complementing the core brick and mortar business, positioning PetSmart to continue to gain market share in the
growing brick and mortar pet retail category.

With over 40 million member profiles, the Treats™ loyalty program provides rich customer data to better
understand consumer preferences and purchasing trends. This large customer database gives PetSmart a competitive
edge in data intelligence over smaller competitors.

**_Merchandise_**

(1) Pro forma Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated based on PetSmart’s Pro Forma Gross Profit for a given period and division, as
adjusted to add back certain items, over PetSmart’s net sales for such period and division. Pro forma Adjusted Gross Margin and Pro
Forma Gross Profit are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial and Other
Data” for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures.
(2) Services revenue includes fees paid to PetSmart from Banfield, a veterinary services provider partnered with PetSmart that operates
most of the Company’s in-store veterinary clinics, and does not include POS fees.

The merchandise offering generally falls into three main categories: consumables, which includes dog and
cat food and treats as well as cat litter products; hardgoods, which includes dog and cat supplies ranging from “fun &
fashion” items (toys, apparel, beds, collars, leashes, etc.) to “problem & solution” items (grooming and beauty,
healthcare and supplements, flea and tick, travel, containment, waste management, etc.); and specialty, which includes
fresh-water fish, small birds, reptiles and other small pets as well as the consumables and hard goods for them.
Merchandise accounted for 87% of the Company’s total net sales for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020, with
consumables, hardgoods and specialty contributing 46%, 27% and 13%, respectively. PetSmart carries the largest pet
merchandise assortment among pet specialty, mass, grocery or other discount retailers, with over 19,500 SKUs and
more than 700 unique brands offered in retail locations and on petsmart.com and onlynaturalpet.com, including
nationally recognized brands as well as an extensive selection of private brands across a wide range of product
categories. The product portfolio is also well-diversified, with no third-party brand representing more than 5% of pro
forma total merchandise sales.

105


-----

Within consumables, PetSmart emphasizes channel-exclusive natural, science-based and therapeutic pet
foods, many of which are not available in grocery stores, warehouse clubs or other mass and general merchandise
retailers. In addition to channel-exclusive products described below, PetSmart offers private brands as well as widely
distributed quality brands in order to provide pet parents with a broad selection of consumables products.

The hardgoods offering is differentiated due to its broad value range, its curated selection and extensive
private and exclusive offerings driven by innovation generated by in-house product development and direct sourcing
capabilities. PetSmart designs and sources a significant portion of hardgoods and specialty items through its product
development office in Phoenix, Arizona, and two sourcing offices in Shanghai and Hong Kong. PetSmart has the
largest selection of products within the brick and mortar pet retail segment.

The specialty offering is a key differentiator against competitors who do not offer live animals or products
for specialty pets, which PetSmart believes serve as an entry point to pet ownership for many younger pet parents.
Also, the in-store fish wall and habitats with reptiles, birds and small and furry pets create a theater to drive traffic.

The Company’s position as the #1 pet care destination, strong relationships with leading product vendors and
educated, passionate and highly trained in-store employees (“associates”) allow PetSmart to offer products that are
exclusively sold (“channel-exclusive”) by pet specialty retailers and not through other retail channels. PetSmart also
offers a selection of private brands across consumables, hardgoods and specialty, which represented approximately
30% of merchandise sales for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020, reflecting an approximately 700 basis points

106


-----

increase in penetration over the last five years. The private consumables offering includes products exclusively sold
at PetSmart and Chewy, such as the Simply Nourish®, Authority® and Only Natural Pet® brands, which generally
carry higher margins than similar branded product. Customers purchasing widely distributed consumables brands
often purchase higher margin hardgoods and specialty products as well, resulting in a positive ticket and creating an
opportunity to upsell these customers to channel exclusive consumables.

**_Services_**

PetSmart is the #1 pet services provider in North America. In substantially all stores, the Company offers
both professional grooming in dedicated salons and specialized training services. It also offers boarding through 207
PetsHotels and veterinary care through 809 third-party pet hospitals which are co-located within stores. The services
offering allows the Company to build trust and loyalty with customers, driving increased traffic to stores and
differentiating the Company from competitors across channels, including specialty retailers, mass, grocery, and online.
Importantly, services cannot be offered online, thus shielding PetSmart from e-commerce competitors. Over the last
five years through fiscal year 2019, services penetration as a percentage of overall PetSmart sales has increased
approximately 120 basis points to 12.4%. Internal data suggests that customers who purchase services transact 1.7x
more regularly and spend 2.1x more annually than non-services customers, and PetSmart estimates that more than
half of services customers also purchase goods. The Company believes that no competitor comes close to its breadth
of services and physical coverage.

**Our Strategy**

PetSmart is committed to developing differentiated, moment-making products, services and experiences that
will attract and retain pet parents as loyal PetSmart customers. The Company has significant opportunities to further
enhance its leadership position in the pet care industry and improve the productivity of stores.

PetSmart believes it has a competitive advantage through unique in-store and omnnichannel solutions for pet
parents, including differentiated products and services for pets and exceptional customer service. The Company’s

107


-----

stores and websites (petsmart.com and onlynaturalpet.com) carry a broad assortment of high-quality pet merchandise
across consumables, hardgoods and what the Company refers to as the “specialty” category. The comprehensive
merchandise offering, with over 19,500 SKUs and more than 700 unique brands offered in retail locations and on
petsmart.com, caters to a wide range of pet parents and provides nearly every item needed to satisfy the lifetime needs
of their pets. In addition, the growing assortment and selection of private and exclusive brands enhance customer
loyalty. PetSmart is also the leading provider of pet services (e.g., professional grooming, boarding, training, day
camp, etc.) in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, further strengthening the Company’s value proposition to customers
and differentiating from others in the pet space. PetSmart maintains a content website to further engage with
customers.

PetSmart will continue to focus on driving comparable sales, expanding margins and generating Free Cash
Flow through the following key business strategies:

**_Winning through a disciplined approach to growth_**

PetSmart’s business is anchored by four key management principles: be efficient, be margin-focused, be
consumer-insight driven and be an aggressive competitor through continued share gains in brick and mortar. PetSmart
has been able to generate cost savings through increased labor efficiencies within stores and rent savings, both of
which have become particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. These four principles have informed the
Company’s overarching strategy since BC Partners took ownership. PetSmart has dedicated significant time and
resources to increasing efficiency, improving its margin profile, refining its customer analytics and competing
aggressively with competitors across channels.

**_Enhancing value proposition by complementing our competitive advantages in brick and mortar with omni-_**
**_channel capabilities_**

PetSmart continues to focus on winning market share in the growing brick and mortar pet retail category by
providing best-in-class in-store merchandise and service offerings complemented by convenient omni-channel
capabilities. Brick and mortar pet retail category has demonstrated resilience despite industry shift to online, growing
by a CAGR of 0.3% from 2015 to 2019, while online penetration increased from just 7% to 22% during that same
time period. Outside of online, brick and mortar is still expected to represent approximately 65% of pet products in
2024, which implies a future expected growth of 1.5%-2.0% per annum. We believe PetSmart is uniquely positioned
to benefit from this growth with its nationwide reach, unmatched merchandise portfolio, which includes new emerging
brands, private brands and specialty, and its robust service offerings, creating a preferred destination for pet parents
and their pets’ everyday needs. PetSmart’s omni-channel capabilities complement the Company’s in-store offering by
providing multiple avenues for customers to interact with PetSmart, driving loyalty and traffic to stores. PetSmart
focuses its efforts on building capabilities designed to drive value through the store base as evidenced by recent
investments made in BOPIS, the preferred omni-channel option for customers, representing 75% of pro forma omnichannel sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, and the PRISM scheduling system, an online and
app-based scheduling tool for services. These investments are designed to enhance the store base profitability and
provide an omni-channel experience for customers while not impacting free cash flow generation. PetSmart also offers
STH and SFS at select locations, as well as a same-day delivery service through its new partnership with DoorDash
Inc., providing an on-demand option to customers.

In addition, PetSmart engages with customers through its leading websites, petsmart.com (one of the most
visited pet websites in the U.S.) and onlynaturalpet.com, and its PetSmart app. Pet education resources available on
these digital channels enhance brand value and drive in-store visits and services sales.

PetSmart will continue to leverage omni-channel capabilities to connect with customers, enhance the in-store
experience and drive store traffic to execute on its core strategy to continue being the leading brick and mortar pet
retailer.

**_Providing pet parents with the largest assortment of pet products with a focus on new and growing brands, private_**
**_brands and specialty products_**

108


-----

PetSmart carries the widest assortment of products across pet merchandise categories, from the value end to
premium end of the product spectrum, and from widely distributed to private or exclusive. Furthermore, the Company
makes it a priority to focus on offering a curated and unique assortment of products that is not widely available for pet
parents by competitors. PetSmart believes in diversifying its brand exposure and enhancing its merchandise offering
with new and growing brands, private brands and specialty. Channel-exclusive brands further drive customer loyalty.
The strategic focus is to continue to execute on and expand merchandising capabilities in key areas including:

     - _Newness to the store: PetSmart is constantly looking to capitalize on new trends, find emerging_
product categories and add new brands to the portfolio, whether from existing vendors or new
entrants to the industry. Introducing newness to the store and pursuing innovative brands and
products remains a key strategic priority, and PetSmart plans to continue to add differentiated and
innovative brands to its product assortment each year. PetSmart also offers a large assortment of
private brands which further drives innovation and new experiences in-store. PetSmart will continue
to work closely with vendors in order to deliver a diverse and relevant product offering at
competitive prices.

     - _Private brands: Private brands are only sold by PetSmart and in limited cases, Chewy, and generate_
significant value for the platform. Private brands guarantee exclusivity, have more attractive
margins than non-private brand products and have protected pricing given the absence of a direct
price comparison. Private brand customers are significantly more valuable than the overall
population, spending more on non-private brand products and shopping more frequently, while also
having a longer overall tenure. Through introducing new brands and improving upon existing
brands, PetSmart, excluding Chewy, has grown private and exclusive penetration from 20% of pro
forma merchandise sales in fiscal year 2011 to over 33% of pro forma merchandise sales during the
twelve month period ended November 1, 2020. The private brand portfolio includes brands such as
Authority, Only Natural Pet and Simply Nourish in Consumables, Top Paw, Arcadia Trail and
Whisker City in hardgoods, and Thrive, All Living Things and Top Fin in specialty. PetSmart
expects to further build on the success of the Company’s private brands and incorporate new
PetSmart-exclusive formulations and sub-brands.

     - _Specialty: The specialty category is an area of differentiation for PetSmart as many of its brick and_
mortar competitors cannot match the Company’s breadth in specialty products or customer service
expertise. Further, as customers cannot easily buy live pets online, specialty is partially insulated
from e-commerce competition. Specialty customers are more likely to be repeat visitors and also
tend to shop more frequently on average than the overall population, presenting incremental upside
for cross-sell opportunities. Over the last five years, PetSmart has increased its specialty category
penetration by approximately 130 basis points while expanding category market share in both brick
and mortar and pet specialty retail by approximately 200 basis points. PetSmart’s differentiated
capabilities in specialty uniquely position the Company to further capitalize on this attractive pet
category.

**_Growing and expanding on our comprehensive service offerings to improve the pet parent experience_**

Over the past twenty years, PetSmart has built from the ground up the leading services offering in the pet
industry, and continues to grow this integral part of the business which serves as a key differentiator versus competitors
across brick and mortar and e-commerce. Services include professional grooming, boarding, training, day camp and
other offerings. Unable to be replicated online, the services business drives store traffic, builds customer loyalty, and
shields PetSmart from e-commerce competitors. It also allows for cross-selling and upselling opportunities as
PetSmart acts as a “one stop shop” for customers. Services customers are significantly more valuable than the overall
population, spending more on merchandise, shopping more frequently, and having a longer average tenure.

PetSmart made important investments in the services business over the past two years, which helped increase
productivity and improve customer experience. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of certain
services offerings, the services segment performed well with 3.8% comparable sales growth during the third fiscal
quarter of 2019 and 6.4% during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019. Technological improvements around customer

booking, appointment management, and payment process enabled by the new PRISM scheduling system provides for
a seamless customer experience and drove an increase in appointment capacity of approximately 15%. Other digital
innovations support marketing efforts to drive demand, reduce inefficiencies in administrative tasks, and improve
cancellation rates via automated appointment reminders. The Company also allocated additional staffing to the
services business, increasing the number of groomers to improve productivity, enabling salons to support their
projections. PetSmart remains focused on improving the quality and consistency of services through extensive,
structured training of employees in all pet services areas. There is an opportunity to further enhance average
transaction value by equipping store associates with tools that better enable them to identify pet parents’ needs and
provide appropriate solutions.

The non-medical pet services category represents the fastest growing retail category based on three-year
historical growth from 2017 to 2019, representing a CAGR of over 6%. Furthermore, spending on non-medical pet
services from 2014 to 2017 grew at over 7%. As the leading pet services provider in a highly fragmented market,
PetSmart is well-positioned to benefit from the strong market dynamics and remain focused on services as a key
strategic priority.

**_Continuing to support pet-related charitable works, including adoptions, which drive pet ownership and creates_**
**_goodwill for the brand_**

Customer analytics show that charitable endeavors are among the top drivers of customer loyalty and buying
intent for PetSmart stores. PetSmart provides space in most stores for pet adoptions through a partnership with
PetSmart Charities (an independent non-profit organization). PetSmart Charities facilitates more pet adoptions than
any other organization with approximately 20% of all pets adopted in the United States in 2019 through PetSmart
stores in partnership with 4,000 animal welfare organizations. In March 2020, PetSmart Charities marked its most
successful national adoption weekend event in its 25-year history, facilitating the adoption of nearly 33,000 pets. This
event brought total pets adopted through PetSmart Charities to 9.2 million. PetSmart Charities is the leading funder
of animal welfare in North America.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Large and Attractive Industry Growing at Approximately 5% Historically_**

The pet care industry is a large and highly attractive category. Supported by secular tailwinds including
increased pet ownership, the continued humanization of pets and the premiumization of pet food, the category reached
$95 billion in total sales in 2019. The sector has also demonstrated higher growth than any other category within retail,
growing at a CAGR of approximately 5% from 2014 to 2019. This growth trajectory is anticipated to continue, as the
forecasted CAGR from 2020 through 2024 is 5.7%.

110


-----

**U.S. Pet Retail Sales (dollars in billions)**

**Historical Segment Growth (2017-2019 CAGR)**

The pet care industry is also one of the most recessionary resistant categories, as increased adoption rates and
effects of pet humanization more than offset any decreases in household spending during economic downturns. During
the last recession, total category CAGR of approximately 6% was driven by an increase in pet ownership, partially
offset by a slight decrease in average household spending on pet products according to the American Pet Products
Association (“APPA”). Pet parents have consistently reduced spending on their pets less than on themselves during
recessionary events, and this trend has continued during the COVID pandemic.

**Pet Care Performance through the “Great Recession” (dollars in billions)**

**_Secular Industry Tailwinds Accelerating with COVID-19 Pandemic_**

The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated tailwinds supporting the sector, including increased pet
ownership, the continued humanization of pets and the premiumization of pet food. Pet adoption rates have increased
through the COVID-19 pandemic as the U.S. population has turned to pets to support mental and physical well-being
during periods of self-isolation. In addition, stay-at-home orders and flexible work schedules have given households
the freedom to care for new pets as people spend more time at home. In 2020, the number of pet-owning households
in the United States is expected to increase by 4% year-over-year, reaching approximately 71 million.

In total, it is estimated that approximately 41.0% (or 51.3 million) of households owned dogs and 25.0% (or
31.4 million) of households owned cats as pets in the United States in calendar year 2020, representing a growth in
number of dog and cat owning households by 5% and 4% respectively compared to 2019. In addition, younger
consumers are spending more money on their pets, with a lower percentage of Millennials (ages 19-36) reporting that
they are “budget-conscious” with regards to pet care spending as compared to older pet parents. The “premiumization”
of pet food has also increased customer’s ticket size, and the longer average lives of pets has increased the number of
purchases over the duration of a pet’s life.

**U.S. Pet Households (in millions) and Approach to Spending**

112


-----

**Humanization and Premiumization Trends Are Key Growth Drivers to the Industry**

Pet supply and pet food retailers are expected to collectively experience an acceleration of growth to 7.7%
(excluding services) in fiscal year 2020, supported by their classification as essential businesses during the COVID19 pandemic. Additionally, there is a positive tailwind coming from increased pet adoptions during quarantine, which
is expected to translate to an increase of 4% year-over-year of pet owning households in fiscal year 2020 and we
believe should offset any trade-down as a result of economic challenges.

Both medical and non-medical pet services (e.g., grooming, trainings, hotel, etc.) have been affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic as they were forced to close or operate at reduced capacity due to social distancing requirements.
Collectively, vet services and non-medical pet services are expected to be down (13%) in fiscal year 2020. Both are
expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels and return to approximately 5% growth as the situation normalizes and the
industry benefits from increased pet ownership.

**Pet Products and Services U.S. Market Projections (dollars in billions)**

Over the next five years, the pet products market is expected to grow at approximately 5% per year (with
services catching up in 2021 and 2022), driven by: (i) continued growth in the number of pet parents (68% of U.S.
households own a pet versus 50% ten years ago); and (ii) premiumization of pet products (over the last five years

113


-----

through the end of fiscal year 2019, spending per pet-owning households has grown at approximately 4% per year).
Services growth is expected to be flat in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and shut-down but continued for pet
products spend per pet-owning households which was up 3% year-over-year.

**_Leading Pet Specialty Brick and Mortar Retailer Gaining Share in Its Channel_**

The pet specialty brick and mortar channel has demonstrated resiliency as the broader retail industry has
shifted online. Although the total pet specialty brick and mortar channel has experienced a 1.0% annual decline since
2015 due to the shift to online and FDM, there has been a clear divergence of performance within the category.
Independent pet specialty players have decreased by almost 40% since 2015, while the larger pet specialty chains have
grown at 2.8% per year, with PetSmart gaining 3 points of share of the pet specialty and other brick and mortar channel.
These trends are likely to continue, as: (i) additional independent pet specialty channels are forced to close due to
performance and liquidity constraints; (ii) customers demand an increase in BOPIS and omni-channel solutions which
require significant investments and scale; (iii) larger stores offer broader product selection and cover the greatest
number of pet species; and (iv) services offerings continue to drive revenue.

**U.S. Pet Product Sales (dollars in billions) by Channel and Specialty Channel Breakdown**

Source: Packaged Facts.

PetSmart has continued to perform well despite competition from the online channel. Although Chewy, the
leading online pet retailer, increased net sales by 40% to 70% in 2018 and 2019, PetSmart achieved significant
sequential improvement in comparable sales growth during this period on a pro forma basis. In the first quarter of
2020, which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and when the brick and mortar channel might have been
expected to lose share to online competitors, despite Chewy adding approximately $200 million incremental sales
compared to the previous four quarters, PetSmart delivered its strongest merchandise comparable sales growth todate. The same pattern repeated in the following two quarters of 2020. Despite the growth of the online channel, brick
and mortar is still expected to represent approximately 65% of pet products in 2024, which implies a future expected
growth of 1.5% to 2.0% per year within the brick and mortar channel.

**U.S. Pet Products (dollars in billions) Online vs. Brick and Mortar**

**PetSmart versus Chewy Change in Sales (Annual and Quarterly) (dollars in millions)**

As the largest player in the North American pet retail category, PetSmart has the opportunity to capture
additional market share from competitors. PetSmart’s 1,650 stores represent 15% of the total estimated 10,500 pet
specialty stores in the U.S., and they generate approximately 1.5x more sales than Petco’s stores and approximately
2.7x more revenue than those of other pet specialty chains. The COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating store closures of
smaller brick and mortar pet retail stores, providing additional market share opportunities for the larger retailers.
Further, PetSmart’s best-in-class services offerings create a flywheel effect, driving additional revenue opportunity.

payment processes for the customer have increased services booking capacity by approximately 15%.

the future.

**_Services, Private Brands and Specialty Offerings Create a Competitive “Moat” and Support Leading Market_**
**_Position_**

PetSmart’s services, private brands and specialty products provide a protective “moat” against competitors,
as they are not available (or widely available) through other channels. These protective moats have a direct impact on
revenue, as 38% of the transactions in 2019 on a pro forma basis included services, private brands or specialty
products. Additionally, these unique capabilities help drive ancillary revenue, as 60% of total purchases in 2019 on a
pro forma basis were made by customers who have purchased at least one of these items.

PetSmart’s Full Suite of Service Offerings Drive Customer Traffic and Loyalty

Service offerings include: a variety of grooming services available across nearly all stores, 207 PetsHotels
available for boarding, Doggie Day camp available 7 days a week, all stages of training, and full veterinary care
offered in 809 stores primarily by the Company’s partner, Banfield. These services are a significant advantage and
differentiator versus brick and mortar competitors as none provide the same breadth and depth as PetSmart – and
importantly services cannot be offered online and thus are shielded from online competitors. In addition to the strong
base business, services customers are significantly more valuable than the overall population, spending more on
merchandise, shopping more frequently, and having a longer average tenure. Over the last 5 years through the end of
fiscal year 2019, services penetration as a percentage of overall PetSmart sales on a pro forma basis has increased
approximately 120 basis points to 12.4%.

**Value of Services Customers**

Private Brands Guarantee Exclusivity and Offer Higher Margins

PetSmart’s private brands presence generates value for the platform in two ways. First, the private brand
margins are more attractive than that of non-private brand products (and are generally priced competitively with
similar third-party brands). Second, as PetSmart’s private brands are only available in PetSmart stores, it provides a
good defensive mechanism as compared to both online and brick and mortar competitors and protects pricing given
the absence of a direct price comparison. Private brands customers are significantly more valuable than the overall
population, spending more outside of private brands, shopping more frequently, with longer overall tenure.

Over the last 5 years through the end of fiscal year 2019, PetSmart’s penetration of private brands has
increased 700 basis points to approximately 30% of merchandise, as it has introduced new selection (e.g., Tiny Tales
hamster habitats, Thrive Reptile brand) and improved upon existing brands (e.g., reformulation/rebranding of
Authority food and All Living Things small animal consumables).

**Value of Private Brand Customers**

Specialty Provides a Strong Moat against Online Competitors as Live Pets Cannot be Sold Online

The specialty category sells live animals, habitats, food, and accessories related to fish, reptiles, birds, and
small animals, and is an area of differentiation for PetSmart. As customers cannot buy live pets online, the segment is
partially insulated from e-commerce competition; beyond that, many of PetSmart’s brick and mortar competitors
cannot match PetSmart’s depth in specialty products.

This differentiation creates a stable book of business, as well as an opportunity to drive repeat business from
customers who initially buy an animal (often with a habitat and accessories), and return for various consumables (i.e.,
food, water filters, etc.). For the last twelve months ended November 1, 2020 versus the same prior year period,
PetSmart’s share of specialty has been up 407 basis points within the pet specialty channel and up 318 basis points
within brick and mortar, reaching 43.9% and 23.4%, respectively. Specialty customers tend to shop more frequently
on average than the overall population, presenting incremental upside for cross-selling opportunities. Over the last 5
years through the end of fiscal year 2019, penetration has increased approximately 130 basis points to approximately
11%.

**_Acceleration of Growth in Pre-COVID Period Following Shift of Blue Buffalo to FDM_**

PetSmart’s long term historical performance can be divided into five distinct phases:

1. **Early Growth: PetSmart experienced strong historical performance from 2007 to 2012, including growing**

through the recession and experiencing an average of approximately 4% comparable sales. This growth was
supported by an acceleration in net new store openings of approximately 95 annually from 2005 to 2008.

2. **Slowdown Pre-Investment: The Company’s growth began to slow meaningfully beginning in 2013 and**

entered negative territory in the first quarter of 2014, resulting in traffic declines – which were exacerbated
by mismanagement and a failed consumables reset.

3. **Early Investment Wins: BC Partners acquired PetSmart in 2015. As a result of cost savings and pricing**

strategies implemented by BC Partners, on a pro forma basis Adjusted EBITDA margins improved
approximately 240 basis points from 14.5% in 2014 to 16.9% in 2016, despite flat comparable sales.

4. **Channel Shifts Mid-Investment: Traffic declines began to accelerate beginning in the third quarter of 2016**

as a result of: (i) acceleration of online growth from Chewy and Amazon; and (ii) movement of two of the
largest channel-exclusive brands into the FDM space, including Blue Buffalo in 2017. As a result,
comparable sales declines reached (4.5%) in 2017. Despite these challenges, PetSmart was able to hold pro
forma Adjusted EBITDA margins at approximately 14% (i.e., pre-deal margins) through aggressive expense
management and promotion optimization strategies.

5. **Return to Positive Growth: A shift in strategy to embrace the Company’s “moats” against online as well as**

a merchandising strategy to bring in new and growing brands provided early shoots in a path to recovery.

**Unpacking Comparable Sales Growth**

PetSmart has seen continuous sequential improvement of percentage comparable sales growth in 2-year
stacked comps. In August 2017, Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula launched in Target, Kroger, Meijer and Publix
and then in April 2018 extended to Walmart which significantly impacted PetSmart’s sales in 2017 and 2018.
PetSmart’s sales from Blue Buffalo represent approximately 40% of what they used to be before the shift and its
impact on PetSmart is decreasing as (i) Blue Buffalo’s share of PetSmart’s portfolio reduces and (ii) Blue Buffalo
reaches maturity in FDM. Removing Blue Buffalo from PetSmart’s sales, which were more heavily impacted than
other retailers due to the higher portion of sales Blue Buffalo comprised, comparable sales growth returned to positive
territory in the second fiscal quarter of 2019 and improved sequentially.

Note: January fiscal year-end (i.e. fiscal year 2019 corresponds to 52 weeks ended in Jan 2020). Figures do not reflect Blue Buffalo SSS.

**_Resilient Financial Performance and Attractive Pro Forma Free Cash Flow Generation_**

PetSmart Pro Forma Cash Flow conversion has consistently been in excess of 70% historically, including
$700 million of capital expenditures invested to improve the business over the past 5 years. In addition to strong Free
Cash Flow, there will be, upon consummation of the Transactions, liquidity in the form of an undrawn ABL.
Management expects to use free cash flow to further de-lever.

**Fiscal Year 2020 YTD Update**

During the thirty-nine week period ended November 1, 2020, much of which was affected by the COVID19 pandemic, PetSmart not only benefitted from the resilience of the broader pet retail industry, but also experienced
further performance uplift that was more unique to PetSmart, driving market share gains. PetSmart’s wide assortment
offering allowed the Company to capitalize during the COVID-19 pandemic and offset a loss of services that will
rebound as the sub-category opens up. In addition, pet adoption increases during the pandemic have provided a secular
tailwind for PetSmart’s growth.

     - _Industry tailwinds: Pet supply and food retailers were deemed “essential services” during the_
government mandated shut-downs, allowing PetSmart and other similar businesses to remain open
for merchandise sales. In addition, pet adoptions and ownership increased during lockdowns,
expanding PetSmart’s customer base and generating higher demand for pet products.

     - _Competitive dynamics: Supply chain and fulfillment challenges faced by certain online competitors_
resulted in further uptick in demand for PetSmart. Strong relationships with key suppliers allowed
the Company to maintain sufficient inventory levels and satisfy the elevated demand from
customers.

     - _PetSmart actions: PetSmart took swift action to actively manage costs and drive up profitability_
through (i) optimizing its labor model, (ii) renegotiating store lease agreements and (iii) reevaluating in-store operational practices to identify long term efficiencies. In support of the top line,
the Company accelerated the roll-out of omni-channel capabilities that promoted social distancing,
namely curbside pickup, allowing customers the comfort and flexibility to shop safely.

Comparable sales in the thirteen-weeks ended May 3, 2020, August 2, 2020 and November 1, 2020 were
1.0%, 10.6% and 13.8%, respectively, combining for 8.4% for the thirty-nine week period ended November 1, 2020.
Merchandise comparable sales for the same quarters were 6.9%, 17.6%, and 18.1%, respectively. While omni-channel
penetration has normalized down from its peak during the government mandated stay-at-home orders, by the end of
the third fiscal quarter of 2020, it remained significantly higher than pre-COVID levels. In the United States, the
approximately 4% of pro forma merchandise sales in the third fiscal quarter of 2020 were through BOPIS, compared
to approximately 1% prior to COVID. Furthermore, in the thirty-nine week period ended November 1, 2020, omnichannel pro forma net sales rose by 239% year-over-year to $360 million.

**Industry Overview**

The pet care industry serves a large, growing, and recession-resilient market. In the U.S., the pet care category
market size was approximately $95.0 billion in calendar year 2019, and included the following sub-segments: (i) pet
food ($36.6 billion); (ii) pet supplies ($18.0 billion); (iii) non-medical pet services ($10.3 billion); and (iv) veterinary
services ($30.1 billion). Approximately 56% of households in the United States owned a pet in calendar year 2020,
which equates to approximately 71 million households. In total, it is estimated that approximately 41.0% (or 51.3
million) of households owned dogs and 25.0% (or 31.4 million) of households owned cats as pets in the United States
in calendar year 2020.

**Illustrative Total Addressable Market**

**U.S. Household Pet Ownership**

123


-----

Supported by secular tailwinds, the pet care category is the fastest growing category within all of retail; the
total category has consistently grown by approximately 5% to approximately 6% in each of the last five years. Pets
are increasingly viewed as members of the family, which has helped drive relatively inelastic demand for pet care
products and services. The “premiumization” of pet food has increased customer’s ticket size, and the longer average
lives of pets has increased the number of purchases over the duration of a pet’s life. Additionally, millennials have
tended to prioritize pet ownership over having children as they enter young adulthood. Pet ownership also boasts
mental and physical health benefits, with 90% of U.S. pet parents believing that their pets have a beneficial impact on
their physical and emotional health. Researchers have tied human health benefits to pet ownership and interaction in
areas including stress, depression, anxiety and PTSD amongst others. Growth trends in pet care are expected to
continue, as the forecasted CAGR from 2019 to 2024 is approximately 5%.

**Historical Segment Growth (2017 to 2019 CAGR)**

**U.S. Pet Retail Sales (dollars in billions)**

The pet care industry has a track record of resiliency during economic downturns. During the last recession,
from 2007 to 2009, total category CAGR of approximately 6% was driven by an increase in pet ownership, partially
offset by a slight decrease in average household spending on pet products. Pet parents have consistently reduced

spending on their pets less than on themselves during recessionary event, and this trend has continued during the
COVID pandemic.

**_Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the U.S. Pet Industry_**

The pet industry has historically proven to be recession-resilient. However, projected U.S. pet retail sales are
expected to decline by 1.2% in 2020 – compared with 5% growth forecasted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic –
resulting in a decrease from $95 billion in 2019 to $94 billion projected in 2020. This forecast factors in sales declines
in 2020 for services which have been impacted by stay-at home and social distancing orders, with the largest decline
expected for non-medical pet services. The decline in services was partially offset by an increase in pet food and pet
products, driven by an increase in pet ownership.

Pet product sales are expected to be up 7.7% in 2020 due to increased pet ownership rates – reflecting overall
resilience in the category, partially impacted by some level of trading down to value and store brands. Pet adoption
rates have increased through the COVID-19 pandemic as the U.S. population has turned to pets to support mental and
physical well-being during periods of self-isolation. In the United States, the approximately 4% projected growth in
pet ownership households in 2020 would increase the number of pet-owning households in the U.S. to nearly 71
million by year-end.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the pet industry is expected to rebound to pre-pandemic
levels and accelerate with tailwinds created by the increased pet adoption rates during the lock-down period. These
factors contribute to the attractiveness of the growing pet care category, of which PetSmart is the only comprehensive
provider of both pet products and services in the United States.

**Merchandising**

Our merchandising team allows us to offer a broad spectrum of product offering across the full pricing
spectrum. Because of our brand strength and industry leadership, we have been able to develop preferred vendor
relationships and can offer channel-exclusive products to our customers. We also have a private brands and
international sourcing division that develops and sources our own proprietary assortments to drive exclusivity, loyalty
and profitability. We work closely and strategically with our vendor/manufacturing base to insure we carry the most
relevant products our customers are looking for at the competitive values.

**Marketing and Advertising**

Our marketing and advertising strategies play an important part in our efforts to acquire new customers and
retain and grow our relationships with current customers. We employ a wide range of channels in our marketing
programs, including traditional mass media efforts like TV advertising, radio advertising and digital circulars, as well
as more targeted techniques like personalized email and customer relationship management, organic and paid search,
digital display and digital retargeting. Our marketing and advertising efforts cover all of our brand channels, including
PetSmart retail stores, PetSmart.com, PetSmart.ca, the PetSmart app and Only Natural Pet. We also use our loyalty

-----

**Distribution**

Our distribution network and information systems are designed to optimize store inventory, drive efficiencies
in store labor, facilitate a high in-stock position, and promote high distribution center productivity. We currently
operate seven regional distribution centers in the U.S. We also utilize two third party operated distribution centers in
Canada to support our Canadian operations and two third party operated fulfillment sites in the U.S. to fulfill ship-tohome orders. Our suppliers generally ship merchandise to our distribution centers, which receive and allocate
merchandise to our stores or third-party fulfilment sites. We contract for the transportation of merchandise within our
supply chain, including the shipment of product to stores, through third-party vendors. We leverage our stores,
distribution centers, two third party e-commerce fulfilment sites as well as our ship from store capabilities in Canada
and our recently launched partnership with DoorDash to efficiently deliver our products to consumers.

**Government Regulation**

We are subject to various federal, state, provincial, international and local laws and regulations, including
those governing: consumer products and consumer protection, food and product safety, advertising and marketing,
labor and employment; data protection and privacy; the distribution, import/export and sale of products (including
live pets); the provision of grooming and other services; pharmacy operations; environmental regulation; and tax. We
seek to structure our operations to comply with all federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations of each
jurisdiction in which we operate. Given varying and uncertain interpretations of these laws and regulations, and
because laws and regulations are enforced by the courts and regulatory authorities with broad discretion, we can make
no assurances we would be found to be in compliance in all jurisdictions, at all times. We also could be subject to
costs, including fines, penalties, or sanctions and third-party claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under,
these laws and regulations.

**Intellectual Property**

We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important component in our
merchandising and marketing strategies. Some of our intellectual property includes numerous service marks and
trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) including: PetSmart®, PetSmart.com®,
PetSmart PetsHotel®, PetSmart Treats® and For the Love of Pets®, as well as many others. We also have several
service mark and trademark applications that are pending with the USPTO and anticipate filing additional applications
in the future. We also own numerous registered service marks, trademarks, and pending applications in other countries,
including Canada. We also own several trade names, domain names and copyrights for use in our business.

**Employees and Human Capital Management**

As of November 1, 2020, we employed approximately 45,000 associates, of which approximately 22,000
were employed full-time. We focus on building strong leaders by investing in education and training for our full and
part-time associates that will support our strategic initiatives. We believe we have a positive relationship with our
associates, which contributes to our emphasis on strengthening our unique culture. None of our employees is
represented by a union. We are not subject to collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced work
stoppages.

**Competition**

The pet products and services retail industry is highly competitive and can be organized into eight different
categories:

- Warehouse clubs and other mass merchandisers;

- Grocery stores;

- Specialty pet supply stores;

128


-----

- Veterinarians;

- General retailers;

- Farm and feed stores;

- E-commerce and catalog retailers; and

- Independent grooming, boarding, and training service providers.

We believe the principal competitive factors influencing our business are product selection, services
offerings, quality of products and services, pricing, customer experience, brand awareness and loyalty, convenience
of store locations, store environment, and omni-channel capabilities, including the ability to deliver products and
services in the manner customers desire such as through buy-online pick-up in store, curbside pickup, online
reservations, and same day delivery. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering a superior
customer experience through our curated product selection, including private brands, services offerings, omni-channel
capabilities, and knowledgeable and caring associates who share a love for pets.

While we currently do not expect that the ultimate outcome of the proceedings and claims pending or
threatened against us will have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements, the
outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, and if decided adversely to us, or if we determine that settlement of
particular litigation is appropriate, we may be subject to liability that could have a material adverse effect on our
condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for a particular period.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

Below is a description of certain terms of the new term loan facility and the new ABL facility. This
description does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the
provisions of the agreements, including the definitions of certain terms therein that are not otherwise defined herein.

**_New Senior Secured Credit Facilities_**

Concurrently with the issuance of the notes, we expect that PetSmart will enter into, and the Corporate Coissuer will become a guarantor of, a new term loan facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent
and collateral agent, and the financial institutions party thereto as lenders from time to time and a new ABL facility,
with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the financial institutions party
thereto as lenders from time to time. The terms of the credit agreements and related documentation for the new term
loan facility and the new ABL facility are under discussion and, accordingly, their definitive terms may vary from
those described below.

**New Term Loan Facility**

**_Overview_**

The new term loan facility is expected to provide for term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $2,300.0
million and provide PetSmart with the right to request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to the
sum of (a) the principal amount of certain voluntary prepayments of the term loans thereunder prior to such date and
(b) an additional amount subject to compliance with certain specified financial ratio incurrence tests. The lenders
under the new term loan facility will not be under any obligation to provide any such incremental commitments, and
the incurrence of any such incremental commitments will be subject to certain customary conditions precedent and
other provisions.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

As of the closing date, at PetSmart’s election, the interest rate per annum applicable to loans issued under the
new term loan facility will be based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to either (i) a base rate
determined by reference to the higher of (a) the U.S. prime rate as quoted by The Wall Street Journal, (b) the federal
funds effective rate plus 0.50% per annum and (c) (x) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) applicable for
an interest period of one month, plus (y) 1.00% per annum, in each case, plus an applicable margin or (ii) an adjusted
LIBOR rate determined by reference to the higher of (a) LIBOR and (b) a floor to be agreed, plus an applicable margin.

**_Amortization and Maturity_**

The new term loan facility is expected to amortize in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual
amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of the new term loan facility, beginning with the second full
fiscal quarter ending after the closing date of the new term loan facility, with the balance being payable on the seventh
anniversary of the closing date, which is expected to be the maturity date of the new term loan facility.

**_Guarantee and Security_**

All obligations of PetSmart under the new term loan facility and any swap agreements and cash management
arrangements provided by any lender party to the new term loan facility or any of its affiliates are expected to be
unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings, the Corporate Co-issuer, the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor and each
existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect material wholly-owned domestic restricted
subsidiary of Holdings (other than PetSmart), subject to customary exceptions including, among other things, where
providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in material adverse tax
consequences.

138


-----

Subject to the intercreditor agreements, all obligations under the new term loan facility and any swap
agreements and cash management arrangements provided by any lender party to the senior secured credit facilities or
any of its affiliates, and the guarantees of such obligations, will be secured, subject to permitted liens and other
exceptions, by: (i) a perfected first-priority pledge of all the equity interests of PetSmart, the Pledged Chewy Stock
and each wholly-owned restricted subsidiary of PetSmart directly held by PetSmart or a subsidiary guarantor (limited
to 65% of voting capital stock of each direct foreign subsidiary owned by PetSmart or its domestic subsidiaries), (ii)
perfected first-priority security interests in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of PetSmart and the
subsidiary guarantors (but excluding the ABL collateral described below and subject to certain other exclusions) (the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the “cash flow collateral”) and (iii) a perfected second-priority security
interest in the ABL collateral of PetSmart and the domestic guarantors under the new ABL facility described below.

**_Certain Covenants and Events of Default_**

The new term loan facility will contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to
certain exceptions, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

    - incur additional indebtedness (including guarantee obligations);

    - create or incur liens;

    - engage in mergers or other fundamental changes;

    - sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets;

    - make investments, acquisitions or loans or advances;

**New ABL Facility**

**_Overview_**

The new ABL facility is expected to provide a senior secured financing of up to $750.0 million, subject to
borrowing base restrictions, available in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars and other currencies to be mutually agreed.

The new ABL facility will provide us the right to request incremental commitments in an aggregate principal
amount of up to $750.0 million. The lenders under the new ABL facility will not be under any obligation to provide
any such incremental commitments, and the incurrence of any such incremental commitments will be subject to certain
customary conditions precedent and other provisions.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Borrowings under the new ABL facility are expected to bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable
margin, plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate, (b) a LIBOR rate or (c) certain other applicable rates. The applicable

139


-----

margin under the new ABL facility will be determined based on our average excess liquidity during the immediately
preceding fiscal quarter as a percentage of the maximum borrowing amount under the new ABL facility.

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the new ABL facility, we will be required to pay
a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum to the lenders under the new ABL facility in respect of the unutilized
commitments thereunder. The commitment fee rate may be reduced to 0.25% if the average daily used portion of the
new ABL facility exceeds 50.0%. We must also pay customary letter of credit fees.

**_Amortization and Maturity_**

The new ABL facility will not amortize. The principal amounts outstanding under the new ABL facility are
expected to become due and payable in full at maturity, on the fifth anniversary of the closing date.

**_Guarantee and Security_**

All obligations of the borrowers under the new ABL facility and certain swap agreements and cash
management arrangements provided by any lender party to the new ABL facility or any of its affiliates are expected
to be unconditionally guaranteed by each guarantor under the new term loan facility (including the Chewy Stock
Affiliate Guarantor) and, with respect to obligations of PetSmart’s Canadian subsidiary (the “Canadian ABL
Borrower”), PetSmart and each other existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect material
wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, with
customary exceptions including, among other things, where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law,
regulation or contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences.

Subject to the intercreditor agreements and certain exceptions and agreements with respect to obligations of
the Canadian ABL Borrower and the guarantees thereof, the obligations under the new ABL facility and certain swap
agreements and cash management arrangements provided by any lender party to the new ABL facility or any of its
affiliates, and the guarantees of such obligations, will be secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by:
(i) a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all personal property of Holdings, the borrowers under the
new ABL facility and the subsidiary guarantors consisting of accounts receivables, inventory, cash, deposit accounts,
securities and commodity accounts, and documents and supporting obligations (but generally excluding intellectual
property) (the “ABL collateral”) and (ii) a perfected second-priority security interest in the cash flow collateral
described above.

**_Certain Covenants and Events of Default_**

The new ABL facility will contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain
exceptions, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

    - incur additional indebtedness (including guarantee obligations);

    - create or incur liens;

    - engage in mergers or other fundamental changes;

liens on assets; and

140

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

In addition, the new ABL facility is expected to require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage
ratio of 1.0:1.0 if excess liquidity (defined in the new ABL facility) is less than the greater of 10% of the maximum
borrowing amount and $70.0 million for a certain period of time.

The new ABL facility will also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default for
facilities of this type, including an event of default upon a change of control.

Each Subsidiary in existence as of the Issue Date, other than Finance Issuer and the Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries, will initially guarantee the Notes on the Issue Date. Each Wholly-Owned Domestic Restricted Subsidiary
that guarantees Obligations under the New Term Loan Credit Facility will also guarantee the Notes following the

Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, such
Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to

Subsidiary.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee (and the obligations of the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor under the Affiliate Guarantee) will be limited as necessary to prevent such Guarantee or the Affiliate
Guarantee of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law;
this limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such Guarantee or the Affiliate Guarantee of the Chewy Stock
Affiliate Guarantor from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its
Guarantee (or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor under its Affiliate Guarantee) will be entitled upon payment in
full of all guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor (or the Chewy Stock

144


-----

Affiliate Guarantor) in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor’s pro rata
portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors and the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor (including any successors and assigns) at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

If a Guarantee or the Affiliate Guarantee is rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other
indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable Guarantor or the Chewy Stock
Affiliate Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee or
the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor’s liability on its Affiliate Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a
court to void the notes and/or the note guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”

A Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged:

(a) in the case of a Guarantor, upon any sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or other disposition
(by merger, consolidation, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (x) the
Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the
applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (y) all or substantially all of
the assets of such Guarantor, in each case, if such sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or other
disposition is not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture (including any
amendments thereof);

(b) (i) upon the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor with respect to the
New Term Loan Credit Facility, (ii) upon the release or discharge of such other guarantee
that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, or (iii) if, at the time of such release and
discharge and assuming such Guarantor were not then a Guarantor under the Indenture,
such Guarantor would not have been required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the
provisions described in “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors,” except, in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii), a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee
(it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a release);

(c) in the case of a Guarantor, upon the designation of such Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(d) upon exercise of the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option by the CoIssuers as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the CoIssuers’ obligations under the Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture;

(e) upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation, winding up or Division of any Guarantor
with and into a Co-Issuer or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, winding up or Division, upon the liquidation of such
Guarantor or upon the transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to a Co-Issuer or
another Guarantor;

(f) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; provided that (i) such Guarantee shall not
be released pursuant to this clause (f) for so long as such Guarantor is an obligor with
respect to any Indebtedness under the New Term Loan Credit Facility and (ii) such
Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date; or

(g) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”

145


-----

In addition, the Affiliate Guarantee of the Notes by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor will provide by its
terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:

(a) on the first date on which the Issuer’s Consolidated Total Debt Ratio is equal to or less
than 2.00:1.00 (and such Affiliate Guarantee will not later be reinstated, even if the Issuer’s
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio later exceeds 2.00:1.00);

(b) upon the release or discharge of the guarantee by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor with
respect to the New Term Loan Credit Facility;

(c) upon exercise of the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option by the CoIssuers as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the CoIssuers’ obligations under the Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture; or

(d) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”

**Ranking**

The Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Guarantees will be Senior Indebtedness of the Co-Issuers
or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, and will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future
Senior Indebtedness of the Co-Issuers or such Guarantor, as the case may be, including the obligations under our New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Unsecured Notes. The Indebtedness evidenced by the Affiliate Guarantee will
be Senior Indebtedness of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, and will rank equal in right of payment with all
existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, including the guarantee of the
obligations under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Unsecured Notes. The phrase “in right of payment”
refers to the contractual ranking of a particular Obligation, regardless of whether an Obligation is secured.

The Obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis
by the CF Debt Priority Collateral owned by the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors, subject to certain Liens permitted
under the Indenture, will be equal in priority as to the CF Debt Priority Collateral owned by the Co-Issuers and the
Guarantors with respect to any other First Lien Obligations of the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors, including under the
New Term Loan Credit Facility, will have a second-priority security interest with respect to the ABL Priority
Collateral and will be effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Co-Issuers and the
Guarantors and any future Junior Lien Obligations of the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors to the extent of the value of
the Collateral owned by the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors (after giving effect to any other senior Lien on such
Collateral), and will be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Co-Issuers and the
Guarantors that is secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of
such assets.

The Obligations under the Notes and the Affiliate Guarantee will be secured on a first-priority basis by the
Pledged Chewy Stock owned by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, subject to certain Permitted Encumbrances
under the Indenture, will be equal in priority as to the Pledged Chewy Stock owned by the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor with respect to any Obligations under any other First Lien Obligations of the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor, including the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor’s guarantee of the New Term Loan Credit Facility, and
will be effectively senior to (i) all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor
and any guarantee by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor of any future Junior Lien Obligations of the Chewy Stock
Affiliate Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the Pledged Chewy Stock (after giving effect to any senior Lien on
the Pledged Chewy Stock) and (ii) all existing and future guarantees of the Obligations of the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor under the ABL Credit Agreement to the extent of the value of the Pledged Chewy Stock.

Substantially all of the operations of the Issuer are conducted through the Issuer’s Subsidiaries. Not all of the
Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes, and as described under “—Guarantees,” Guarantees may be
released under certain circumstances. In addition, some or all of the Issuer’s future Subsidiaries may not be required
to guarantee the Notes. Unless the Subsidiary is a Guarantor or a Co-Issuer, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries,

146


-----

including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority
with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Co-Issuers and the
Guarantors, including the Holders of the Notes, even if such claims do not constitute Senior Indebtedness. The Notes,
therefore, will be structurally subordinated to holders of Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors)
and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than Finance Issuer) that are not Guarantors,
other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed to a Co-Issuer or a Guarantor.

As of November 1, 2020, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions:

(1) the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors would have had:

        - (i) $3,500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness secured on a firstpriority basis by CF Debt Priority Collateral and on a second-priority basis by ABL
Priority Collateral, consisting of Secured Indebtedness under the New Term Loan Credit
Facility and the Notes, (ii) no Indebtedness under the ABL Credit Agreement (without
giving effect to $62.0 million of letters of credit that are expected to remain outstanding
under the new ABL Credit Agreement) secured on a first-priority basis by ABL Priority
Collateral and on a second-priority basis by CF Debt Priority Collateral and (iii) $750.0
million of additional revolving borrowing capacity under the ABL Credit Agreement
(excluding $62.0 million of letters of credit that are expected to remain outstanding under
the new ABL Credit Agreement); and

        - $1,150.0 million outstanding unsecured senior Indebtedness for borrowed money,
consisting of the Unsecured Notes; and

(2) the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor would have had: (i) $3,500.0 million aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness secured on a first-priority basis by the Pledged Chewy Stock, consisting of
Secured Indebtedness under the New Term Loan Credit Facility and the Notes, (ii) no Indebtedness
under the ABL Credit Agreement (without giving effect to $62.0 million of letters of credit that are
expected to remain outstanding under the new ABL Credit Agreement) secured on a second-priority
basis by the Pledged Chewy Stock, (iii) $750.0 million of additional revolving borrowing capacity
under the ABL Credit Agreement (excluding $62.0 million of letters of credit that are expected to
remain outstanding under the new ABL Credit Agreement), and (iv) $1,150.0 million outstanding
unsecured senior Indebtedness for borrowed money, consisting of the Unsecured Notes; and

(3) the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries would have had $22.7 million of Indebtedness (excluding
intercompany liabilities).

Although (i) the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness or Disqualified
Stock that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur or issue, as the case may be, and the issuance of
Preferred Stock by the Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement will contain
limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor may incur, such
limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications. The amount of such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock that may be incurred or issued in compliance with the covenants could be
substantial and in certain circumstances, may be Secured Indebtedness. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”, “—Certain Covenants—Liens”
and “—Security for the Notes—Pledge of the Chewy Stock”.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Co-Issuers will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes. The initial
Paying Agent for the Notes will be the Trustee.

The Co-Issuers will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”). The Co-Issuers will also
maintain a transfer agent. The initial Registrar will be the Trustee. The initial transfer agent will be the Trustee. The

147


-----

Registrar and the transfer agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of any Notes in certificated, non-global
form outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of such Notes in certificated,
non-global form on the behalf of the Co-Issuers.

The Co-Issuers may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the transfer agents without prior notice to
the Holders. Either the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries may act as a Paying Agent or Registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the restriction set out in the
section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Transfer Restrictions.” The Registrar and the Trustee may require a
Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer
of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. None of the Co-Issuers nor the Trustee will be
required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in
connection with a Change of Control Offer, an Alternate Offer, an Asset Sale Offer, an Advance Offer or other tender
offer. Also, the Co-Issuers and the Trustee will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15
days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed. The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of the Note for all
purposes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Co-Issuers will issue $1,200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The Notes
will mature on       , 2028. Subject to compliance with the covenants described below under the caption “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Co-Issuers may issue additional Notes from time to time
after this offering under the Indenture (“Additional Notes”). It is intended, to the maximum extent possible, the Notes
offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for
all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the
context requires otherwise, references to “Notes” for all purposes of the Indenture, the Guarantees and this
“Description of Senior First Lien Notes” include any Additional Notes that are actually issued. If any Additional Notes
are not part of the same issue as the Notes offered hereby under the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
if the Co-Issuers otherwise determine that any Additional Notes should be differentiated from any other Notes, such
Additional Notes will have a separate CUSIP number; provided that such Additional Notes and all other Notes will
still constitute a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate of    % per annum and will be payable in cash semi-annually in
arrears on        and       , commencing on       , 2021, to the Holders of record on the immediately
preceding                        and       , as the case may be. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the
most recent date on which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date.
Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30 day months. Each
interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the CoIssuers maintained for such purpose as described under “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” or, at the option
of the Co-Issuers, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their respective addresses set
forth in the register of Holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to
the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by The Depository Trust Company
(“DTC”) or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the
Holder or Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Co-Issuers, the Co-Issuers’ office or agency will be the
office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. If any interest payment date, the maturity date or any earlier required
repurchase or Redemption Date falls on a day that is a Legal Holiday, the required payment will be made on the next
succeeding Business Day and no interest on such payment or other payment will accrue in respect of the delay. The
Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $250,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of
$250,000.

148


-----

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Co-Issuers will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Co-Issuers may be required to offer to purchase Notes
as described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” The Issuer and its Affiliates may at any time
and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Security for the Notes**

**_Collateral Generally_**

The Notes and the Guarantees thereof will be secured on a pari passu basis with the obligations under the
New Term Loan Credit Facility by (i) perfected first-priority security interests in the CF Debt Priority Collateral and
(ii) perfected second-priority security interests in the ABL Priority Collateral, in each case, subject to Permitted Liens,
customary exceptions and excluding the Excluded Assets. First Lien Secured Parties other than the Holders have rights
and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could also adversely affect the value of the Collateral
benefiting the Holders, particularly the rights described below under “—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.” For a
description of the Collateral, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Term Loan Facility—Guarantee and
Security” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—New ABL Facility.”

The Co-Issuers and the Guarantors are and will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future which
could share in the Collateral, including Additional First Lien Obligations and Obligations secured by Permitted Liens.
The amount of such additional Obligations will be limited by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Liens” and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Under certain circumstances, the amount of any such additional
Obligations could be significant.

The Affiliate Guarantee will be secured on a pari passu basis with the obligations under the New Term Loan
Credit Facility by perfected first-priority security interests in the Pledged Chewy Stock, subject to Permitted
Encumbrances and customary exceptions. First Lien Secured Parties other than the Holders have rights and remedies
with respect to the Pledged Chewy Stock that, if exercised, could also adversely affect the value of the Pledged Chewy
Stock benefiting the Holders, particularly the rights described below under “—Pledge of Chewy Stock.” For a
description of the Pledged Chewy Stock, see “Pledge of Chewy Stock.”

The Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor is and will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future which
could share in the Pledged Chewy Stock, including indebtedness secured by Liens on the Pledged Chewy Stock with
Pari Passu Lien Priority relative to the Notes (including the obligations under the New Term Loan Credit Facility or
the First Lien Obligations) or with Junior Lien Priority relative to the Notes (including the obligations under the ABL
Credit Agreement), in each case, to the extent not prohibited by the Indenture, and Permitted Encumbrances. Under
certain circumstances, the amount of any such additional Obligations could be significant.

Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction);

(c) any asset if, to the extent that and for so long as the grant of a Lien thereon to secure the First Lien

would require consent or approval of any governmental authority (including any legally effective
requirement to obtain the consent of any governmental authority), but excluding any prohibition or
restriction that is ineffective under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction;

(d) margin stock (other than the Pledged Chewy Stock);

on the Issue Date or on the date any Subsidiary is acquired or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary (if
such prohibition is not incurred in contemplation of such acquisition or becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary);

(f) assets to the extent a security interest in such assets would result in material adverse tax
consequences to the Issuer, its Subsidiaries or their Affiliates as reasonably determined by the CoIssuers in good faith; provided that the Co-Issuers make the same determination with respect to all
other First Lien Obligations;

(g) any intent-to-use trademark application prior to the filing of a “Statement of Use” or “Amendment
to Allege Use” with respect thereto, to the extent (if any) that, and solely during the period (if any)

intent-to-use trademark application under applicable federal law;

(h) any lease, license or other agreement or any property subject thereto (including pursuant to a
purchase money security interest or similar arrangement) to the extent that a grant of a security
interest therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement or purchase money
arrangement or create a breach, default or right of termination in favor of any other party thereto
(other than any Co-Issuer or Guarantor) after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment
provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction or other similar
applicable law, other than proceeds and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly
deemed effective under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction or other
similar applicable law notwithstanding such prohibition;

(i) any of the voting Equity Interests in excess of 65% of the outstanding voting Equity Interests of (A)
any first-tier Foreign Subsidiary or (B) any FSHCO;

Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock” that are paid into an escrow account to be released upon satisfaction of certain
conditions or the occurrence of certain events, including cash or Cash Equivalents set aside at the
time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, to the extent such cash or Cash Equivalents prefund
the payment of interest or premium or discount on such indebtedness (or any costs related to the
issuance of such Indebtedness) and are held in such escrow account or similar arrangement to be
applied for such purpose; and

(s) any other asset to the extent that the cost of obtaining a security interest in such asset or perfection
thereof is excessive in relation to the benefit to the Holders of the security to be afforded thereby
(as reasonably determined in good faith by the Co-Issuers) (the relevant assets shall be limited in a
manner reasonably determined in good by the Co-Issuers in order to reduce such cost); provided
that the Co-Issuers make the same determination with respect to all other First Lien Obligations.

Certain security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes will not be in place on the date of issuance of
the Notes or will not be perfected on such date, but will be required to be put in place as promptly as practicable
thereafter.

In addition:

(a) Liens required to be granted from time to time pursuant to the Indenture shall be subject to

interests in any such assets (it being understood that there shall be no Security Document (or other
security agreements or pledge agreements) governed under the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction);
and

(d) no actions shall be required to perfect a security interest in letter of credit rights or commercial tort
claims (in each case, other than the filing of a UCC financing statement).

**_Further Assurances and After-Acquired Collateral_**

The Co-Issuers will, and will cause each Guarantor to, execute any and all further documents, financing
statements (including continuation statements and amendments), agreements and instruments, and take all further
actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements, fixture filings, mortgages, deeds of trust and other
documents) that may be required under applicable law or that the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent may reasonably
request, in order to grant, preserve, maintain, protect and perfect (or continue the perfection of) the validity and priority

151


-----

of the security interests created or intended to be created by the Security Documents in the Collateral, all at the expense
of the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors.

If, after the Issue Date, any property or assets are acquired by a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor or are held by
any Restricted Subsidiary on or after the time it becomes a Guarantor pursuant to the Indenture (other than assets
constituting Collateral under a Security Document that become subject to the Lien created by such Security Document
upon acquisition thereof or constituting Excluded Assets), the Co-Issuers will notify the First Lien Notes Collateral
Agent thereof, and the Co-Issuers will cause such assets to be subjected to a Lien securing the First Lien Notes
Obligations and will take, and cause the Guarantors to take, such actions as shall be necessary or reasonably requested
by the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent and consistent with the Indenture and the agreements governing other First
Lien Obligations to grant and perfect such Liens, all at the expense of the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors.

The Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor will execute any and all further documents, financing statements
(including continuation statements and amendments), agreements and instruments, and take all further actions
(including the filing and recording of financing statements, fixture filings, mortgages, deeds of trust and other
documents) that may be required under applicable law or that the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent may reasonably
request, in order to grant, preserve, maintain, protect and perfect (or continue the perfection of) the validity and priority
of the security interests created or intended to be created by the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement in the
Pledged Chewy Stock, all at the expense of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor.

**_Liens with Respect to the Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, the Co-Issuers, the Guarantors and the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent will enter into
the Security Documents (and, in the case of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, the Chewy Stock Guarantee and
Pledge Agreement) establishing the terms of the security interests with respect to the Collateral. These security
interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the First Lien Notes Obligations of the CoIssuers and the Guarantors.

By their acceptance of the Notes, each Holder will be deemed to accept the terms of, agree to be bound by
and authorize and direct each of the Trustee and the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to enter into and
perform its respective obligations under, the Security Documents (and, in the case of the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor, the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement).

**_Pledge of Chewy Stock_**

Substantially concurrently with the Chewy Distribution on the Issue Date, an affiliate of the Issuer, including
its successors and assigns (the “Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor”) will enter into a guarantee and pledge agreement
with the Trustee (the “Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement”) pursuant to which it will guarantee the Notes
and other Indebtedness not prohibited under the Indenture (the “Affiliate Guarantee”) and pledge       shares of
Class B common stock of Chewy, Inc. (the “Pledged Chewy Stock”) to secure its obligations under the Affiliate
Guarantee, the Notes, the New Term Loan Credit Facility and any other First Lien Obligations on a first-priority basis
and under the ABL Credit Agreement on a second-priority basis (the “Chewy Stock Collateral Pledge”). The Chewy
Stock Affiliate Guarantor will not be a Subsidiary of the Issuer, and will not be subject to any of the negative covenants
set forth in the Indenture to which the Issuer and the Guarantors will be subject.

Pursuant to the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement, the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor will
agree that it will not:

(a) engage in any material operations or business or hold any material assets, other than (A) maintaining
corporate existence, (B) ownership of the Pledged Chewy Stock, (C) entering into the Chewy Stock
Guarantee and Pledge Agreement, and exercising rights and performing obligations pursuant
thereto, (D) incurring Indebtedness and Liens not prohibited by the terms of the Chewy Stock
Guarantee and Pledge Agreement, (E) incurring fees, costs and expenses relating to the foregoing,
including professional fees for legal, tax and accounting advisers, paying taxes and providing

152


-----

indemnification to officers and directors, and (F) activities incidental or related to clauses (A)
through (E);

(b) create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become, directly or indirectly, liable,
contingently or otherwise, with respect to any Indebtedness other than any Guarantee of
Indebtedness not prohibited by the Indenture or any Lien described below;

Indebtedness, other than (A) Liens securing the Notes and any other First Lien Obligations
(including the obligations under the New Term Loan Credit Facility), to the extent not prohibited
by the Indenture, (B) Liens with Junior Lien Priority relative to the Notes (including the obligations
under the ABL Credit Agreement), to the extent not prohibited by the Indenture, and (C) Permitted
Encumbrances;

(d) sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Pledged Chewy Stock, except (A) pursuant to
customary substitution rights providing for the substitution of any shares of Pledged Chewy Stock
with an equivalent number of shares of Class A and/or Class B common stock of Chewy, Inc., or
(B) in compliance with clause (e) below; or

(e) consolidate or amalgamate with, or merge with or into, or convey, sell or otherwise transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to, any other Person or permit any other Person to merge into or
consolidate or amalgamate with it, in one or more related transactions, unless (A) the surviving
Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger, or to
which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made
is an Affiliate of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor organized or existing under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof (such Person, as
the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor”), (B) the
Successor Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor complies with the requirements set forth in clauses (a),
(b) and (c) above upon the effectiveness of the applicable transaction (as if all outstanding
Indebtedness and Liens of such assignee were incurred at such time), (C) the Successor Chewy
Stock Affiliate Guarantor expressly assumes all the obligations of the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor under the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement pursuant to customary
documents or instruments in form substantially similar to the documents or instruments delivered
to the administrative agent under the New Term Loan Credit Facility, and (D) the Successor Chewy
Stock Affiliate Guarantor shall hold the Pledged Chewy Stock upon the effectiveness of the
applicable transaction pursuant to the terms of the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Description of Senior First Lien Notes, the Chewy Stock
Affiliate Guarantor may assign all of its rights and obligations under the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge
Agreement, and the Pledged Chewy Stock may be transferred, subject to the pledge, directly or indirectly, to any other
Person that is an Affiliate of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor that is organized or existing under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof, provided that (A) such assignee
complies with the requirements set forth in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above upon the effectiveness of such assignment
(as if all outstanding Indebtedness and Liens of such assignee were incurred at such time), (B) such assignee expressly
assumes all the obligations of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor under the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge
Agreement pursuant to customary documents or instruments in form substantially similar to the documents or
instruments delivered to the administrative agent under the New Term Loan Credit Facility, and (C) such assignee
shall hold the Pledged Chewy Stock upon the effectiveness of such assignment pursuant to the terms of the Chewy
Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement. Further, upon the effectiveness of such assignment to an assignee, the
assignor will be automatically and unconditionally released from the Chewy Stock Collateral Pledge and the Affiliate
Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement.

The Indenture and the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement will provide that the Chewy Stock
Collateral Pledge and the Affiliate Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released:

153


-----

(1) on the first date after the Issue Date on which the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio of the Issuer for the

Applicable Measurement Period is equal to or less than 2.00:1.00;

(2) in the case that the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor is released from its Affiliate Guarantee with respect

to the Notes pursuant to the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement, upon the release from such
Affiliate Guarantee; and/or

(3) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

By their acceptance of the Notes, each Holder will be deemed to accept the terms of, agree to be bound by
and authorize and direct each of the Trustee and the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to enter into and
perform their respective obligations under, the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement and any amendment,
supplement or joinder permitted by the Indenture and the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement.

There is no public trading market for Chewy’s Class B common stock. Certain transfers of such shares,
including a transfer in connection with a foreclosure on the Pledged Chewy Stock by the First Lien Notes Collateral
Agent or other controlling agent, will generally result in those shares automatically converting on a one-to-one basis
to Class A common stock of Chewy, Inc. Chewy’s Class A common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol “CHWY”. For more information regarding the historical financial performance and results of
operations of Chewy, refer to the “Historical Chewy” columns and other information set forth in “Unaudited Pro
Forma Financial Information of PetSmart” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
results of Operations” in this offering memorandum. For a description of Chewy’s Class A common stock, see Exhibit
4.1 to Chewy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020.

**_First Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

The First Lien Notes Collateral Agent and the Term Loan Collateral Agent will enter into an intercreditor
agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) with respect to
the Collateral, which may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other parties
holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture, the New Term Loan Credit Facility and
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor will be party to the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement and the Pledged Chewy Stock will be subject to the provisions thereof (with all references to
the Shared Collateral herein deemed to include the Pledged Chewy Stock, as applicable).

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Controlling Collateral Agent” will have the right to
act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The Controlling Collateral Agent is the Term Loan
Collateral Agent and will remain the Term Loan Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of the Term
Loan Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such
earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). From and after the Controlling Collateral Agent
Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the Additional First Lien Collateral Agent.

With respect to any Shared Collateral, no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other NonControlling Secured Party shall or shall instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or
nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official
appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to,
or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it
in respect of, any Shared Collateral.

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any NonControlling Authorized Representative, the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such NonControlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the
occurrence of both (a) an event of default (under and as defined in the Additional First Lien Document under which
the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative), and (b) each Collateral Agent’s
and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling

154


-----

Authorized Representative and that an event of default (under and as defined in the Additional First Lien Document
under which the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative) has occurred and is
continuing and (ii) the Additional First Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which such Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result
of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable Additional First Lien Document;
_provided that such event of default (under and as defined in the Additional First Lien Document under which such_
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorizing Representative) shall be
continuing at the end of such 180-day period; provided, further, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative
Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any
Shared Collateral if (1) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any
enforcement action (including delivery by the Controlling Collateral Agent of a notice to the ABL Collateral Agent
that commences an ABL Priority Standstill Period) with respect to a material portion of such Shared Collateral, (2) at
any time the Term Loan Collateral Agent is stayed under the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement from pursuing
enforcement actions with respect to such Shared Collateral or (3) at any time the Co-Issuer or the Guarantor that has
granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to)
any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The Controlling Collateral Agent is the Term Loan Collateral Agent and the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent
will have no rights to take any action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral
unless and until it becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing each Series of First Lien
Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent may deal with the Shared Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral
Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling
Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling
Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise
by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of
any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral, or to cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do so. Each
of the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) question or contest or
support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the
perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien
Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The
foregoing shall not be construed to limit the rights and priorities of any First Lien Secured Party, any Collateral Agent
or any Authorized Representative with respect to any Collateral not constituting Shared Collateral.

If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of First Lien Obligations
has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party is taking
action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution (including any adequate protection
payments) is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceedings of a Co-Issuer
or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor or any Guarantor or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment
pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared
Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by the Controlling
Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or remedies or received
by any Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to
such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution (subject, in the case of any such distribution, to the
paragraph immediately following), to which the First Lien Obligations are entitled under such other intercreditor
agreement shall, subject to the terms of the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement, with respect to the ABL Priority
Collateral, be applied:

(A) FIRST, to the payment of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent and Trustee and the Term
Loan Administrative Agent (in its capacity as such) and any other Authorized Representative on a
ratable basis;

(B) SECOND, subject to the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, to the payment in full
of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, with such proceeds to be applied to the First Lien
Obligations of a given Series in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents

155


-----

for such Series; provided that following the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding with respect to any Co-Issuer or Guarantor (or the Affiliate Guarantor), solely as among
the holders of First Lien Obligations and solely for purposes of this clause SECOND and not any
First Lien Documents, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire
amount of post-petition interest on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a)
and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other
bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations
of each Series of First Lien Obligations constituting post-petition interest shall include only the
maximum amount of post-petition interest on the First Lien Obligations allowable under Section
506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or
other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding; and

(C) THIRD, after the payment of all First Lien Obligations, to the Co-Issuers, Guarantors and the
Affiliate Guarantors or their successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whosoever
may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

It is the intention of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series that the holders of First Lien Obligations of
such Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court
of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable
law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (y) any of the
First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any
other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations
(other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of
First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (ii) the existence
of any Collateral for any other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred
to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such
Series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such
Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders
of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of
such Series of First Lien Obligations permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne
solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event
the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation,
pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other bankruptcy law in a
jurisdiction outside of the United States), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the First Lien Documents
governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified.

None of the First Lien Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or
other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Party seeking
damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared
Collateral. In addition, none of the First Lien Secured Parties may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part
thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any First Lien Secured Party obtains
possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any First Lien
Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement),
at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral,
proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral,
proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, and subject to the terms of the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor
Agreement with respect to ABL Priority Collateral, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or
otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or
not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each other Collateral Agent
for the benefit of each Series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released
and discharged as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared

156


-----

Collateral are released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be
applied as described in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

_Certain Limitations Applicable in Bankruptcy Proceedings_

If a Co-Issuer, any Guarantor or the Affiliate Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if a Co-Issuer, any Guarantor or the Affiliate Guarantor shall, as
debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders
(the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other applicable
bankruptcy law or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, or under any
equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), each First-Lien Secured Party (other than any
Controlling Secured Party or the Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will agree not to object
to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to
any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent (acting on the
instruction of the Applicable Authorized Representative) opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP
Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the
Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured
Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling
Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are
subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such
Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling
Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as:

(A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared
Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement
of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other
than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior
to the commencement of the bankruptcy case;

(B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged
to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP
Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First Lien Secured
Parties as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (other than any Liens of the First Lien
Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens);

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien
Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and

(D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic
payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such
adequate protection are applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

_provided that the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall not limit the right of the First Lien Secured Parties of each_
Series to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the
First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided,
_further, that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First Lien_
Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured
Parties in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral.

The First Lien Secured Parties acknowledge that the First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the
limitations set forth in the other First Lien Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated,
supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced (in whole or in part) or otherwise amended or modified from
time to time, in each case, without notice to, or the consent (except to the extent a consent is otherwise required to
permit the refinancing transaction under any First Lien Document) of any First Lien Secured Party of any other Series,

157


-----

all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.

**_Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

If a Co-Issuer or any of the Guarantors were to incur Indebtedness secured by the Collateral with a Junior
Lien Priority relative to the Notes, the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent and the
applicable Junior Lien Collateral Agent will enter into an intercreditor agreement substantially in the form attached to
the Indenture (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement”). The Junior
Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other
parties holding Junior Lien Obligations and First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the relevant
agreements, or their respective representatives. If the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor pledges the Pledged Chewy
Stock to secure any Junior Lien Obligations, it will also become a party to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement
(with all references to the Shared Collateral herein deemed to include the Pledged Chewy Stock, as applicable).

Notwithstanding the date, time, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document or instrument or
grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens granted to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured
Parties on the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) or of any Liens granted to any First Lien Secured Parties
on the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) (or any actual or alleged defect in any of the foregoing) and
notwithstanding any provision of the UCC, any applicable law, any Junior Lien Documents or any First Lien
Documents or any other circumstance whatsoever, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien
Representative, in each case on behalf of itself and each Junior Lien Secured Party under its Junior Lien Documents,
will agree that any Lien on the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) securing any First Lien Obligations
now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any First Lien Secured Parties or any First Lien Representative or other agent
or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise,
shall have priority over and be senior in all respects and prior to any Lien on the Collateral (including the Pledged
Chewy Stock) securing any Junior Lien Obligations.

Pursuant to the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, prior to the Discharge of First Lien
Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent or any person authorized by it will have the exclusive right to exercise
any right or remedy with respect to the Collateral and will also have the exclusive right to determine and direct the
time, method and place for exercising such right or remedy or conducting any proceeding with respect thereto. - From
and after the Junior Enforcement Date, the designated Junior Representative may exercise or seek to exercise any
rights or remedies (including setoff) with respect to any Shared Collateral in respect of any Junior Lien Obligations,
or institute any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any action of foreclosure), but
only so long as (1) the Controlling Collateral Agent has not commenced and is not diligently pursuing any enforcement
action with respect to such Shared Collateral or (2) the Grantor, or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, which has
granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is not then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject
to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. In exercising rights and remedies with respect to any collateral securing
both the First Lien Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent and the First Lien
Secured Parties may enforce the provisions of the First Lien Documents and exercise remedies thereunder, all in such
order and in such manner as they may determine in their sole discretion. Such exercise and enforcement shall include
the rights of an agent appointed by them to sell or otherwise dispose of Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur expenses
in connection with such sale or disposition and to exercise all the rights and remedies of a secured lender under the
Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction and of a secured creditor under bankruptcy laws of any
applicable jurisdiction.

The “Junior Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Junior Lien Representative, the date which is 180
days after the occurrence of both (i) an event of default (under and as defined in the Junior Lien Document for which
such Junior Lien Representative has been named as representative) and (ii) the Controlling Collateral Agent’s and
each other representative’s receipt of written notice from such Junior Lien Representative that (x) such Junior Lien
Representative is the Junior Lien Representative and that an event of default (under and as defined in the Junior Lien
Document for which such Junior Lien Representative has been named as Representative) has occurred and is
continuing and (y) the Junior Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which such Junior Lien Representative is
the Junior Lien Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or
otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable Junior Lien Document; provided that the Junior Enforcement

158


-----

Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral
(1) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action
with respect to such Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Co-Issuer, the Guarantor or the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor which has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or
otherwise subject to) any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.

The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree
pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement that it will not (and will waive any right to) take any action to,
contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of a Lien securing any First Lien Obligations
held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any of the First Lien Secured
Parties or any agent or trustee therefor in any Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) or other collateral
securing both the First Lien Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement
will provide for a reciprocal restriction on the ability of any Collateral Agent to contest or support any other Person in
contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection,
priority or enforceability of any Lien securing any Junior Lien Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on
behalf of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any of the Junior Lien Secured Parties in the Collateral (including the
Pledged Chewy Stock) securing the Junior Lien Obligations.

Subject to the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, the
Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such
Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) upon the exercise of remedies will be applied to the First Lien
Obligations prior to application to any Junior Lien Obligations or the Pledged Chewy Stock in such order as specified
in the relevant First Lien Security Documents until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has occurred.

In the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition of any or all of the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy
Stock) (including all or substantially all of the equity interests of any subsidiary of the Company), the Liens granted
to the Junior Lien Representatives and the Junior Lien Secured Parties upon such Collateral to secure Junior Lien
Obligations shall terminate and be released, automatically and without any further action, concurrently with the
termination and release of all Liens granted upon such Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) to secure First
Lien Obligations.

**_Certain Matters in Connection with Liquidation and Insolvency Proceedings under any Junior Lien Intercreditor_**
**_Agreement_**

_Debtor-in-Possession Financings_

The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Secured Party will agree, among other things,
that if a Co-Issuer, any Guarantor or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding and the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party desires to permit (or not object
to) the use of cash collateral or to permit a Co-Issuer, any Guarantor or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor to obtain
DIP Financing to be secured by any collateral securing both the First Lien Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations,
then each Junior Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will not object
to such use of cash collateral or DIP Financing and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in
connection therewith (except to the extent permitted by the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) and, to the extent
the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations are subordinated to or _pari passu_ with such DIP Financing, will
subordinate its Liens in the Collateral and any other collateral to such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating
thereto), any adequate protection liens granted to the First Lien Secured Parties, and any “carve out” for professional
and United States Trustee fees agreed to by the Controlling Collateral Agent, on the same basis as they are
subordinated to the First Lien Obligations pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The Junior Lien
Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree that notice received two
Business Days prior to the entry of an order approving such usage of cash or other collateral or approving such DIP
Financing shall be adequate notice.

159


-----

_Relief from Automatic Stay; Bankruptcy Sales; and Post-Petition Interest_

No Junior Lien Secured Party may (x) seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to any Collateral
without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, or object to any motion for relief from the
automatic stay with respect to the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) made by the Controlling Collateral
Agent, (y) object to any lawful exercise by any holder of First Lien Obligations of the right to credit bid such claims
under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code, or to any sale
or other disposition of any Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) that the Controlling Collateral Agent has
consented to, provided that in the case of such a sale, the parties’ respective liens will attach to the proceeds of such
sale on the same basis of priority as such liens existed on the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) pursuant
to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, or (z) object to any claim of any holder of First Lien Obligations for postpetition interest, fees, costs, expenses, and/or other charges under Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise
(for this purpose ignoring all claims and Liens held by the Junior Lien Secured Parties on the Collateral (including the
Pledged Chewy Stock)).

_Adequate Protection_

Each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will
agree that none of them (x) shall object to (a) any request by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the First Lien Secured
Parties for adequate protection in any form, (b) any objection by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the First Lien
Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action, or proceeding based on the Controlling Collateral Agent’s or the First
Lien Secured Parties’ claiming a lack of adequate protection, or (c) the allowance and payment of interest, fees,
expenses, or other amounts of the Controlling Collateral Agent or the First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection
or otherwise under Section 506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other bankruptcy
law, (y) assert or support any claim for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Shared Collateral under
Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other bankruptcy law or (z) request any form
of adequate protection except as permitted by the following sentence. If the First Lien Secured Parties (or any subset
thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a
superpriority administrative expense claim in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under
Section 363 or 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other bankruptcy law, then each Junior
Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, may seek or request
adequate protection in the form of (as applicable) a Lien on such additional or replacement collateral and/or a
superpriority administrative expense claim, which Lien and/or superpriority administrative expense claim (as
applicable) will be subordinated to the Liens securing and claims with respect to the First Lien Obligations and such
DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens securing and claims with
respect to the Junior Lien Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens securing and claims with respect to the First
Lien Obligations under the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement; provided that each Junior Lien Representative, for
itself and on behalf of each other Junior Lien Secured Party under the applicable Junior Lien Debt, will waive its rights
under Section 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code and consent and agree that such superpriority administrative claims
may be paid under a plan of reorganization in any form having a value on the effective date of such plan equal to the
allowed amount of such claims, and (ii) in the event any Junior Lien Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of
the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, seek or request adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted
in the form of (as applicable) a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative
expense claim, then such Junior Lien Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien
Secured Parties, agree that the First Lien Representatives shall also be granted (as applicable) a senior Lien on such
additional or replacement collateral as security for the First Lien Obligations and/or a senior superpriority
administrative expense claim, and that any Lien on such additional or replacement collateral securing the Junior Lien
Obligations and/or superpriority administrative expense claim shall be subordinated to the Liens on such collateral
securing and claims with respect to the First Lien Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating
thereto) and any other Liens and claims granted to the First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection on the same
basis as the other Liens securing and claims with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations are so subordinated to such
Liens securing and claims with respect to First Lien Obligations under the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection in the
form of payments in the amount of current post-petition fees and expenses, and/or other cash payments, then the Junior
Lien Representatives shall not be prohibited from seeking adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount
of current post-petition fees and expenses, and/or other cash payments (as applicable), subject to the right of the First

160


-----

Lien Secured Parties to object to the reasonableness of the amounts of fees and expenses or other cash payments so
sought by the Junior Lien Secured Parties.

_Plans of Reorganization_

No Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Secured Party may support or vote in favor of any
plan of reorganization (and each shall be deemed to have voted to reject any plan of reorganization) that is inconsistent
with the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If it is held that the claims of the First Lien Secured Parties and the Junior Lien Secured Parties in respect of
the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of
senior and junior secured claims) under a plan of reorganization, then each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and
on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, will acknowledge and agree that all distributions from the
Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior
secured claims against the Co-Issuers, the Guarantors or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor in respect of the
Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of
the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Junior
Lien Secured Parties), the First Lien Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to
them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition
interest, fees, and expenses (whether or not allowed or allowable in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before
any distribution is made from the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) in respect of the Junior Lien
Obligations, with each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured
Party, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent amounts otherwise received or
receivable by them from the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) to the extent necessary to effectuate the
intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Junior Lien Secured
Parties).

**_ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement_**

The First Lien Notes Collateral Agent, the Term Loan Collateral Agent and the ABL Collateral Agent will
enter into an intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “ABL/Cash Flow
_Intercreditor Agreement”) that will set forth the relative priority of the Liens securing the ABL Obligations and the_
Liens securing the CF Debt Obligations, as well as certain other rights, priorities and interests of the holders of the CF
Debt Obligations and the holders of the ABL Obligations. The ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement may be
further amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding ABL Obligations
and CF Debt Obligations permitted to be incurred under the relevant agreements, or their respective representatives.

_Lien Priority and Similar Liens_

Notwithstanding the time, order or method of creation, attachment or perfection of any Liens securing the
ABL Obligations or any Liens securing the CF Debt Obligations or any failure, defect or deficiency or alleged failure,
defect or deficiency in any of the foregoing, (i) the Liens securing the ABL Obligations on the ABL Priority Collateral
rank senior to any Liens securing the CF Debt Obligations on the ABL Priority Collateral and (ii) the Liens securing
the CF Debt Obligations on the CF Debt Priority Collateral rank senior to any Liens securing the ABL Obligations on
the CF Debt Priority Collateral.

_No Interference_

No holder of any CF Debt Obligations may contest the validity or enforceability of the ABL Obligations or
the Liens securing the ABL Obligations, and no holder of any ABL Obligations may contest the validity or
enforceability of the CF Debt Obligations or the Liens securing the CF Debt Obligations.

161


-----

_Exercise of Remedies_

Neither the CF Debt Agents nor the CF Debt Secured Parties may commence or instruct the CF Debt Agents
to commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver,
liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy
or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interest in or realize upon, or take any other action
available to it in respect of, the ABL Priority Collateral under any documents governing CF Debt Obligations,
applicable law or otherwise until the associated Discharge of the ABL Obligations (including, without limitation,
exercising any rights under any deposit account control agreement constituting ABL Priority Collateral), it being
agreed that only the ABL Collateral Agent or any Person authorized thereby, acting in accordance with the applicable
documents governing the ABL Obligations, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such remedies
prior to the associated Discharge of ABL Obligations; provided, however, that a CF Debt Agent (subject to the terms
of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if any) may exercise any or all
such rights with respect to any ABL Priority Collateral (but not rights the exercise of which is otherwise prohibited
by the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement) after a period (the “ABL Priority Standstill Period”) of 180
consecutive days has elapsed from the date of delivery of written notice from the CF Debt Agent to the ABL Collateral
Agent stating that (i) an event of default (as defined under the indenture or other debt facility for such CF Debt
Obligations) has occurred and is continuing thereunder, (ii) the CF Debt Obligations under such indenture or other
debt facility are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in
accordance with the terms of such documents, and (iii) such CF Debt Agent intends to exercise its rights to take such
actions; provided, further, that such CF Debt Agent shall not be entitled to exercise any such rights with respect to
any ABL Priority Collateral in the event (x) the ABL Collateral Agent or the ABL Secured Parties are then diligently
pursuing their rights and remedies with respect to all or a material portion of the ABL Priority Collateral or diligently
attempting to vacate any stay or prohibition against such exercise or (y) a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor is then a debtor
under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to ) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

Neither the ABL Collateral Agent nor the ABL Secured Parties may commence or instruct the ABL Collateral
Agent to commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver,
liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy
or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interest in or realize upon, or take any other action
available to it in respect of, the CF Debt Priority Collateral under any documents governing ABL Obligations,
applicable law or otherwise until the associated Discharge of the CF Debt Obligations (including, without limitation,
exercising any rights under any deposit account control agreement constituting CF Debt Priority Collateral), it being
agreed that only a CF Debt Agent or any Person authorized thereby, acting in accordance with the applicable
documents governing the CF Debt Obligations, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such remedies
prior to the associated Discharge of CF Debt Obligations; provided, however, that the ABL Collateral Agent may
exercise any or all such rights with respect to any CF Debt Priority Collateral (but not rights the exercise of which is
otherwise prohibited by the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement) after a period of 180 consecutive days has
elapsed from the date of delivery of written notice from the ABL Collateral Agent to each CF Debt Agent stating that
(i) an event of default (as defined under the documents governing the ABL Obligations) has occurred and is continuing
thereunder, (ii) the ABL Obligations are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof
or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such documentation, and (iii) such ABL Collateral Agent intends to
exercise its rights to take such actions; _provided,_ _further, that such ABL Collateral Agent shall not be entitled to_
exercise any such rights with respect to any CF Debt Priority Collateral in the event (x) any CF Debt Agent or the CF
Debt Secured Parties are then diligently pursuing their rights and remedies with respect to all or a material portion of
the CF Debt Priority Collateral or diligently attempting to vacate any stay or prohibition against such exercise or (y)
a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to ) any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the trustee or agent acting on behalf of any holders (or the holders themselves)
of obligations secured by junior-priority Liens on any Collateral may, subject to certain provisions of the ABL/Cash
Flow Intercreditor Agreement, take all such actions as it shall deem necessary to (i) perfect or continue the perfection
of its junior-priority Liens or (ii) to create, preserve or protect (but not enforce) the junior-priority Liens on any
Collateral. In addition, the trustee or agent acting on behalf of any holders (or the holders themselves) of obligations
secured by junior-priority Liens may, among other things, (i) file a claim or proof of claim or statement of interest,
_provided_ that an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding has been commenced by or against a Co-Issuer or any

162


-----

Guarantor, (ii) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim,
adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of its
claims or Liens, in each case in accordance with the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) in accordance with
the provisions of the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement, file any pleadings, objections, motions or agreements
that assert rights or interests available to unsecured creditors, and (iv) vote on any plan of reorganization, file any
proof of claim, make other filings and make any arguments and motions that are, in each case, in accordance with the
terms of the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement.

_Release of Liens_

Upon any sale, transfer, or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral that results in the release of the
Lien securing the ABL Obligations on such item of ABL Priority Collateral that (A) is not prohibited by the documents
governing the CF Debt Obligations or (B) occurs in connection with the foreclosure upon or other exercise of rights
and remedies with respect to such ABL Priority Collateral, the Lien securing the CF Debt Obligations on such item
of ABL Priority Collateral will be automatically released; provided that such Lien securing the CF Debt Obligations
shall remain in place with respect to any proceeds of such sale, transfer or other disposition that remain after the
associated Discharge of ABL Obligations. Upon any sale, transfer, or other disposition of any CF Debt Priority
Collateral that results in the release of the Lien securing the CF Debt Obligations on such item of CF Debt Priority
Collateral that (A) is not prohibited by the documents governing the ABL Obligations or (B) occurs in connection
with the foreclosure upon or other exercise of rights and remedies with respect to such CF Debt Priority Collateral,
the Lien securing the ABL Obligations on such item of CF Debt Priority Collateral will be automatically released;
_provided that such Lien securing the ABL Obligations shall remain in place with respect to any proceeds of such sale,_
transfer or other disposition that remain after the associated Discharge of CF Debt Obligations.

_ABL Collateral Agent’s Access and Use Rights_

The CF Debt Secured Parties will (subject to certain exceptions) permit the ABL Collateral Agent to enter
upon and use the CF Debt Priority Collateral for a period not to exceed 180 days (subject to extension during periods
when the ABL Collateral Agent is stayed or otherwise prohibited by law from exercising such rights) following, the
date on which the ABL Collateral Agent takes any enforcement action with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, for
purposes of (1) assembling and storing the ABL Priority Collateral and completing the processing of and turning into
finished goods of any ABL Priority Collateral consisting of work-in-process, (2) selling any or all of the ABL Priority
Collateral located on such CF Debt Priority Collateral, whether in bulk, in lots or to customers in the ordinary course
of business by liquidation, sale or otherwise, (3) removing any or all of the ABL Priority Collateral located on such
CF Debt Priority Collateral, or (4) taking reasonable actions to protect, secure and otherwise enforce the rights of the
ABL Secured Parties in and to the ABL Priority Collateral; provided, however, that nothing contained in the ABL/Cash
Flow Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the rights of any CF Debt Agent from selling, assigning or otherwise
transferring any such CF Debt Priority Collateral prior to the expiration of such 180-day period if the purchaser,
assignee or transferee thereof agrees to be bound by the applicable provisions of the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Tracing of Collateral and Priorities in Proceeds_

Prior to the issuance of any Enforcement Notice by the ABL Collateral Agent or a CF Debt Agent or the
commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to a Co-Issuer or a Guarantor, whether any
asset was acquired with “proceeds” (within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code) of ABL Priority Collateral
or CF Debt Priority Collateral will be disregarded for purposes of determining the relative priorities in the Collateral
that was so acquired. In addition, unless and until the Discharge of ABL Obligations occurs, the CF Debt Agents and
the CF Debt Secured Parties will each consent to the application, prior to the receipt by the ABL Collateral Agent of
an Enforcement Notice issued by any CF Debt Agent, of cash or other proceeds of Collateral, deposited under account
agreements to the repayment of ABL Obligations pursuant to the ABL Credit Agreement; _provided_ that after the
receipt by the ABL Collateral Agent of an Enforcement Notice from any CF Debt Agent, any identifiable proceeds of
the CF Debt Priority Collateral (whether or not deposited under account agreements with the ABL Agent) shall be
treated as CF Debt Priority Collateral.

163


-----

_Application of Proceeds and Turn-Over Provisions_

In connection with any enforcement action with respect to the Collateral or any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding with respect to a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor, all proceeds of (x) ABL Priority Collateral will first be
applied to the repayment in full of all outstanding ABL Obligations before being applied to any outstanding CF Debt
Obligations and (y) CF Debt Priority Collateral will first be applied to the repayment in full of all outstanding CF Debt
Obligations before being applied to any outstanding ABL Obligations. If any holder of a CF Debt Obligation or ABL
Obligation receives any proceeds of Collateral in contravention of the foregoing, such proceeds will be turned over to
the CF Debt Agent or ABL Collateral Agent, as applicable, for application in accordance with the foregoing.

_Amendment and Refinancings_

The ABL Obligations and the CF Debt Obligations may be amended or refinanced, in whole or in part, in
accordance with the ABL Credit Agreement and the documents governing the CF Debt Obligations, in each case,
without notice to, or consent of, any or all of the lenders, holders, trustee, or agents thereunder, and subject to
continuing rights and obligations of the holders of such refinancing Indebtedness under the ABL/Cash Flow
Intercreditor Agreement; provided that the holders of such refinancing debt, either directly or through an agent or
representative bind themselves to the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Certain Matters in Connection with Liquidation and Insolvency Proceedings under the ABL Intercreditor_**
**_Agreement_**

_Debtor-in-Possession Financings_

In connection with any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor, if the ABL
Collateral Agent or the holders of ABL Obligations do not oppose or object to certain debtor-in-possession financings
secured by a Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral or to the use of cash collateral constituting proceeds of ABL Priority
Collateral, no holder of a CF Debt Obligation shall be entitled to object to such use of cash collateral or debtor-inpossession financing to the extent the Liens securing such debtor-in-possession financing are senior to or rank equal
with the Liens of the ABL Collateral Agent on the ABL Priority Collateral. To the extent that the Liens to be provided
to the lenders providing such debtor-in-possession financing secured by a Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral are
senior to, or rank equal with, the Liens of the ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of ABL Obligations on such ABL
Priority Collateral, the Liens securing the CF Debt Obligations on such ABL Priority Collateral will be subordinated
to the Liens provided to the lenders under the debtor-in-possession financing thereon, to the Liens of the ABL
Collateral Agent on the ABL Priority Collateral and any adequate protection Liens granted to the ABL Collateral
Agent and the holders of the ABL Obligations thereon, and to any “carve-out” from the ABL Priority Collateral for
professional fees or United States Trustee fees agreed to by the ABL Collateral Agent, so long as the holders of CF
Debt Obligations retain their valid, perfected and unvoidable Liens on all the CF Debt Priority Collateral, including
proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, with the same priority
as existed prior to the commencement of such proceeding. In connection with any insolvency or liquidation proceeding
of a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor, if the CF Debt Agents or the holders of CF Debt Obligations do not oppose or object
to certain debtor-in-possession financings secured by a Lien on the CF Debt Priority Collateral or to the use of cash
collateral constituting proceeds of CF Debt Priority Collateral, no holder of an ABL Obligation shall be entitled to
object to such use of cash collateral or debtor-in-possession financing to the extent the Liens securing such debtor-inpossession financing are senior to or rank equal with the Liens of the CF Debt Agents on the CF Debt Priority
Collateral. To the extent that the Liens to be provided to the lenders providing such debtor-in-possession financing
secured by a Lien on the CF Debt Priority Collateral are senior to, or rank equal with, the Liens of the CF Debt Agents
and the holders of CF Debt Obligations on such CF Debt Priority Collateral, the Liens securing the ABL Obligations
on such CF Debt Priority Collateral will be subordinated to the Liens provided to the lenders under the debtor-inpossession financing thereon, to the Liens of the CF Debt Agents on the CF Debt Priority Collateral and any adequate
protection Liens granted to the CF Debt Agents and the holders of the CF Debt Obligations thereon, and to any “carveout” from the CF Debt Priority Collateral for professional fees or United States Trustee fees agreed to by the CF Debt
Agents, so long as the holders of ABL Obligations retain their valid, perfected and unvoidable Liens on all the ABL
Priority Collateral, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding, with the same priority as existed prior to the commencement of such proceeding.

_Relief from Automatic Stay; Bankruptcy Sales and Post-Petition Interest_

No holder of any CF Debt Obligation may (x) seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to any ABL
Priority Collateral unless otherwise consented to by the ABL Collateral Agent or the ABL Collateral Agent or ABL
Secured Parties have first also sought relief from the automatic stay with respect to such ABL Priority Collateral, or
object to any motion by the ABL Collateral Agent or any ABL Secured Party seeking relief from the automatic stay
with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, (y) object to any sale of any ABL Priority Collateral or any lawful exercise
by any holder of ABL Obligations of the right to credit bid such claims under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code
or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or any sale in foreclosure of ABL Priority Collateral, in
each case which has been consented to by the holders of ABL Obligations, provided that in the case of such a sale,
the order approving such sale provides that the parties’ respective liens will attach to the proceeds of such sale with
the same basis of priority as such liens existed on the particular assets being sold prior thereto, or (z) object to any
claim by the ABL Collateral Agent or any holder of ABL Obligations to post-petition interest, fees, or expenses to the
extent of its Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral, without regard to the existence of the Lien of the holders of CF Debt
Obligations of the ABL Priority Collateral. No holder of any ABL Obligation may (x) seek relief from the automatic
stay with respect to any CF Debt Priority Collateral unless otherwise consented to by the Controlling CF Debt Agent
or the Controlling CF Debt Agent or CF Debt Secured Parties has first also sought relief from the automatic stay with
respect to such CF Debt Priority Collateral, or object to any motion by the Controlling CF Debt Agent or any other
CF Debt Secured Party seeking relief from the automatic stay with respect to the CF Debt Priority Collateral, (y)
object to any sale of any CF Debt Priority Collateral or any lawful exercise by any holder of CF Debt Obligations of
the right to credit bid such claims under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of
the Bankruptcy Code or any sale in foreclosure of CF Debt Priority Collateral, in each case which has been consented
to by the holders of the CF Debt Obligations, provided that in the case of such a sale, the order approving such sale
provides that the parties’ respective liens will attach to the proceeds of such sale with the same basis of priority as
such liens existed on the particular assets being sold prior thereto, or (z) object to any claim by a CF Debt Agent or
any holder of CF Debt Obligations to post-petition interest, fees, or expenses to the extent of its Lien on the CF Debt
Priority Collateral, without regard to the existence of the Lien of the holders of ABL Obligations of the CF Debt
Priority Collateral.

_Adequate Protection_

No CF Debt Agent, on behalf of itself and the applicable holders of CF Debt Obligations, may (i) seek
adequate protection on account of its Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral other than in the form of additional or
replacement junior-priority liens on post-petition assets of the same type as the ABL Priority Collateral or juniorsuperpriority claims (provided that the ABL Collateral Agent is also granted adequate protection in the same form that
is granted to each CF Debt Agent, which Lien or superpriority administrative claim (as applicable) is senior to that
granted to such CF Debt Agent in respect of the ABL Priority Collateral) or (ii) object to any request by the holders
of ABL Obligations for adequate protection on account of the ABL Priority Collateral (other than payments of postpetition interest, fees, or expenses from the proceeds of CF Debt Priority Collateral). The ABL Collateral Agent, on
behalf of itself and the holders of ABL Obligations, may not (i) seek adequate protection on account of its Lien on the
CF Debt Priority Collateral other than in the form of additional or replacement junior-priority liens on post-petition
assets of the same type as the CF Debt Priority Collateral or junior-superpriority claims (provided that each CF Debt
Agent is also granted adequate protection in the same form that is granted to the ABL Collateral Agent, which Lien
or superpriority administrative claim (as applicable) is senior to that granted to the ABL Collateral Agent in respect
of the CF Debt Priority Collateral) or (ii) object to any request by the holders of CF Debt Obligations for adequate
protection on account of the CF Debt Priority Collateral (other than payments of post-petition interest, fees, or
expenses from the proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral).

_Plans of Reorganization_

Neither the ABL Collateral Agent, the CF Debt Agents, nor any holder of any ABL Obligations or CF Debt
Obligations may support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding
that is inconsistent with the terms of the ABL/Cash Flow Intercreditor Agreement.

If it is held that the claims of the ABL Secured Parties and the claims of the CF Debt Secured Parties in
respect of any Collateral constitute claims in the same class (rather than separate classes of secured claims) under a

165


-----

plan of reorganization, then the ABL Secured Parties and the CF Debt Secured Parties acknowledge and agree that all
distributions from the Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of ABL Obligations and CF Debt
Obligations against the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value
of the ABL Priority Collateral or the CF Debt Priority Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all juniorpriority secured claims on such Collateral held by the other secured parties), the ABL Secured Parties or the CF Debt
Secured Parties, respectively, shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of
principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, and
expenses that are available from the applicable senior-priority Collateral for each of the ABL Secured Parties and the
CF Debt Secured Parties (regardless of whether any such claims for post-petition interest, fees, or expenses, may or
may not be allowed or allowable in whole or in part as against the Co-Issuers or any of the Guarantors in the applicable
insolvency or liquidation proceeding(s) pursuant to Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise), respectively,
before any distribution is made in respect of any claims of the holders of obligations secured by junior-priority Liens
on such Collateral in respect of their junior-priority secured obligations from, or with respect to, such applicable
senior-priority Collateral, with the holders of such junior-priority claims acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to
the respective other senior-priority secured parties amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from, or with
respect to, such applicable senior-priority Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence,
even if such turnover has the effect of reducing their aggregate recoveries).

**_Release of Collateral_**

The Co-Issuers and the Guarantors will be entitled to the release of property and other assets constituting
Collateral (other than the Pledged Chewy Stock) from the Liens securing the Notes and the First Lien Notes
Obligations under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) to enable us to consummate the sale, transfer or other disposition of such property or assets to the
extent not prohibited under the covenant described under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Asset Sales”;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Notes pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture, the release from such Guarantee; and/or

(3) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

The Chewy Stock Collateral Pledge will be automatically and unconditionally released as described under
“—Security for the Notes—Pledge of Chewy Stock.”

The Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees and the Liens on the Pledged Chewy Stock
securing the Affiliate Guarantee, as applicable, also will be released (i) upon payment in full of the principal of,
together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes and all other Obligations (other than continuing contingent
obligations in respect of which no claim has been made) under the Indenture, the Guarantees, the Affiliate Guarantee,
as applicable, and the Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, are paid, (ii) upon a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture as
described below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or a discharge of the Indenture as described
under “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or (iii) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements described above.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indenture or the Security Documents to the contrary, (i) upon
request by the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent at any time, the Holders shall confirm in writing the First Lien Notes
Collateral Agent’s irrevocable authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property;
provided that the absence of such confirmation shall not affect in any way the validity of the automatic releases of
security interest, and (ii) the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent shall, at the Co-Issuers’ expense and upon receipt of
an Officer’s Certificate, execute and deliver to the Co-Issuers or the applicable Guarantor such documents as the CoIssuers, such Guarantor or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor may reasonably request to evidence the release of
such item of Collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock from the assignment and security interest granted under the
Security Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, in each case so long as such Holders or the First Lien
Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, receives an Officer’s Certificate stating that such release or subordination, as
applicable, is in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and applicable Security Document.

166


-----

**_Amendments_**

The Indenture and the Security Documents will provide that the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent and each
Collateral Agent may enter into any amendment (and, upon request by the Co-Issuers in accordance with the relevant
First Lien Notes Documents, each Authorized Representative shall sign a consent to such amendment) to any Security
Document, so long as the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent or such Collateral Agent and the Trustee receive an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel of the Co-Issuers stating that such amendment is not expressly
prohibited by the terms of each then extant agreements governing the outstanding First Lien Obligations. Additionally,
the Indenture and the Security Documents will provide that each Holder and each other First Lien Secured Party agrees
that the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent and each Collateral Agent may enter into any amendment (and, upon request
by the Co-Issuers, each Authorized Representative shall sign a consent to such amendment) to any Security Document
solely as such Security Document relates to a particular series of First Lien Obligations so long as (x) such amendment
is in accordance with the agreements governing the First Lien Obligations pursuant to which such series of First Lien
Obligations was incurred (including, in the case of the Notes, the Indenture and the other Notes Documents) and (y)
such amendment does not adversely affect the material rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any other series.
Each Authorized Representative will execute and deliver (at the sole cost and expense of the Co-Issuers) all such
authorizations and other instruments as shall reasonably be requested by the Co-Issuers to evidence and confirm any
release of Collateral or amendment to any Security Document provided for in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
and in the case of the Trustee or First Lien Notes Collateral Agent, upon receipt of the documents required by the
Indenture. By accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have agreed to these provisions.

**_Sufficiency of Collateral_**

The fair market value of the Collateral and the fair market value of the Pledged Chewy Stock, in each case,
is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral and the Pledged
Chewy Stock in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The
amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock would also be dependent on numerous
factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock, as
applicable, at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral or the
Pledged Chewy Stock may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be
no assurance that the Collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock, as applicable, can be sold in a short period of time or in
an orderly manner. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive postpetition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under
the Notes exceeds the value of the Collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock (after taking into account all other firstpriority debt that is also secured by the Collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock, as applicable), or any “adequate
protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the Notes.

**_Certain Bankruptcy Limitations_**

The right of the Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral (and the Pledged Chewy Stock)
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired by any bankruptcy law in the event that a
bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against a Co-Issuer, any Guarantor or the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor prior to the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent’s having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Upon
the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the First Lien Notes
Collateral Agent is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of
security without bankruptcy court approval.

In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long
payments under the Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the First
Lien Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock, the value of the
Collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of
the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral or the Pledged Chewy
Stock. The Bankruptcy Code permits only the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs and attorneys’
fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the
Collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock.

167


-----

Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral
or the Pledged Chewy Stock is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders of the Notes would
hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral or the Pledged Chewy Stock to which the Holders
of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below and in the fourth paragraph under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Change of Control,” the Co-Issuers will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at their option prior to       , 2024.

At any time prior to       , 2024, the Co-Issuers may, at their option and on one or more occasions, redeem
all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption (any applicable date of redemption hereunder, the
“Redemption Date”), subject to the rights of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date.

On and after       , 2024, the Co-Issuers may, at their option and on one or more occasions, redeem the
Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” at the redemption
prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to
the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on        of each of the years
indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2024 ........................................................................................................................................... %
2025 ........................................................................................................................................... %
2026 and thereafter .................................................................................................................... 100.000%

In addition, until       , 2024, the Co-Issuers may, at their option, upon notice as described under the
heading “—Selection and Notice,” on one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of
Notes (including Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to    % of the aggregate
principal amount thereof, with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds from one or more Equity
Offerings, to the extent such net cash proceeds are received by or contributed to a Co-Issuer, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the
Redemption Date; provided that (a) at least 50% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally
issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date (but excluding any Additional Notes issued under the Indenture after the
Issue Date) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption unless all such Notes are
redeemed substantially concurrently and (b) each such redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of closing of
each such Equity Offering.

In addition, at any time prior to       , 2024, the Co-Issuers may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes during each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable
Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date.

Notice of any redemption of, or any offer to purchase, the Notes may, at the Co-Issuers’ discretion, be given
in connection with an Equity Offering, other transaction (or series of related transactions) or an event that constitutes
a Change of Control and prior to the completion or the occurrence thereof, and any such redemption or purchase may,
at the Co-Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion
or occurrence of the related Equity Offering, transaction or event, as the case may be. In addition, if such redemption

168


-----

or purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such
condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Co-Issuers’ discretion, the Redemption Date or purchase date may
be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase
was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or
waived, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all
such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Redemption Date or purchase date or by the Redemption
Date or purchase date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Co-Issuers’ discretion
if the Co-Issuers reasonably believe that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the
Co-Issuers may provide in such notice or offer that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of
the Co-Issuers’ obligations with respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender
offer and the Co-Issuers, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Co-Issuers, purchases all of the
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Co-Issuers or such third party will have the right upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days following such repurchase date, to
redeem (with respect to the Co-Issuers) or repurchase (with respect to a third party) all Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such tender offer (which may be
less than par and shall exclude any early tender premium or similar premium and any accrued and unpaid interest paid
to any Holder in such tender offer payment) plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the Redemption Date or purchase date, subject to the right of Holders
of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling
on or prior to the Redemption Date or purchase date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a
tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer, Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as applicable, Notes owned
by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by an Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof,
shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer,
Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as applicable.

The Issuer and its Affiliates may acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer,
open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise so long as such acquisition does not otherwise violate the
terms of the Indenture.

**_Selection and Notice_**

With respect to any partial redemption or purchase of Notes made pursuant to the Indenture, selection of the
Notes for redemption or purchase will be made on a pro rata basis to the extent applicable or by lot or by such method
as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided that if the Notes are represented by global notes, interests in
the Notes shall be selected for redemption or purchase by DTC in accordance with its standard procedures therefor;
_provided, further, that no Notes of less than $250,000 can be redeemed or repurchased in part._

Notices of purchase or redemption shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the purchase or Redemption Date to each Holder at such
Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC (with a copy to the Trustee),
except that notices of redemption may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the
notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or as set
forth in the fifth paragraph under the heading “—Optional Redemption.” If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed
in part only, any notice of offer to purchase or redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the
principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed.

If any Notes are to be purchased or redeemed in part only, the Co-Issuers will issue a new Note in principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of
the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption, unless such redemption
is conditioned (in accordance with the Indenture) on the happening of a future event. On and after the Redemption
Date, unless the Co-Issuers default in payment of the redemption price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or

169


-----

portions thereof called for redemption, unless such redemption is conditioned (in accordance with the Indenture) on
the happening of a future event.

The Co-Issuers may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a
single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any
such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different redemption dates
and, with respect to redemptions that occur on the same date, may specify the order in which such redemptions are
deemed to occur.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Issue Date, unless the Co-Issuers have,
prior to or concurrently with the time the Co-Issuers are required to make a Change of Control Offer, delivered
electronically or sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional
Redemption” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” the Co-Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes
pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof (or such higher amount as the Co-Issuers may determine (any Change of Control Offer at a
higher amount, an “Alternate Offer”)) (such price, the “Change of Control Payment”) plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date
(as defined below). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except in the case of a conditional Change of
Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below, the Co-Issuers will send notice of such
Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder to the address of such Holder
appearing in the security register or otherwise electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with a copy
to the Trustee with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Change of
Control,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be
accepted for payment by the Co-Issuers;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 Business Days nor later
than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); provided
that the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed, in the Co-Issuers’ discretion, until such
time (including more than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions
referred to in clause (7) below shall be satisfied or waived;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that, unless the Co-Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes
accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the
Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on
the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the
paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business
on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued new
Notes (or, in the case of global notes, such Notes shall be reduced by such amount of Notes that the
Holder has tendered) and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered (the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $250,000
or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof);

170


-----

(7) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control (or such other conditions
specified therein and shall describe each such condition), and, if applicable, shall state that, in the
Co-Issuers’ discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time
(including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered) as any and all such conditions
shall be satisfied or waived, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded
in the event that the Co-Issuers reasonably believe that any or all such conditions (including the
occurrence of such Change of Control) will not be satisfied or waived by the Change of Control
Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and

(8) the other instructions, as determined by the Co-Issuers, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder
must follow.

While the Notes are in global form and the Co-Issuers make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes through the
facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Co-Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by them or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with
an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered
to and purchased by the Co-Issuers.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Co-Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to
have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

With respect to the Notes, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Co-Issuers, or any third
party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Co-Issuers as described below, purchases all of the Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the holders of such series of Notes will be deemed to have
consented to such tender or other offer and accordingly, the Co-Issuers or such third party will have the right, upon
not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days following such purchase
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem (with respect to the Co-Issuers) or purchase (with
respect to a third party) all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase on a date (the “Second Change of
_Control Payment Date”) at a price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment in respect of the Second_
Change of Control Payment Date, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Second
Change of Control Payment Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Second Change of Control Date. In
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the
Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to
be outstanding for the purposes of such Change of Control Offer.

Agreements relating to Indebtedness to which a Co-Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may
prohibit or limit, such Co-Issuer from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change
of Control occurs at a time when the Co-Issuers are contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Co-Issuers
could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings
that contain such prohibition. If the Co-Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Co-Issuers

171


-----

will remain contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Co-Issuers’ failure to purchase
tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture.

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide, and any future credit agreements or other agreements
relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change
of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under
the Indenture). If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under our New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and/or such other agreement, we may seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and/or the Indebtedness governed by such other agreements. In the event we do not obtain
such a waiver or refinance the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements or repurchase such
Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and/or
such other agreements being declared due and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by
our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any
required repurchases of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes— We may
not be able to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required by the indentures that will govern the notes.”

In the event that we make a Change of Control Payment, we will pay (or cause the paying agent to pay) to
each Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate a new Note
equal in principal amount to any portion of the Notes surrendered that have not been tendered by the Holders, if any;
_provided that each such new Note must be in a principal amount of $250,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in_
excess thereof. The Co-Issuers will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as
practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity) and, thus, the removal of incumbent management.
We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although
it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the
future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not
constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at
such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.

Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of
the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford
Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party
approved in writing by the Co-Issuers makes the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Alternate Offer) in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the
Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control
Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Alternate Offer) may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditional upon such Change of Control and such other conditions specified therein, if a definitive agreement is in
place for the Change of Control at the time of the making of such Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than a Permitted Holder. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it
may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Co-Issuers to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

172


-----

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Co-Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of Change of Control, may be waived or modified
with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. A Change of Control Offer
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Alternate Offer) may be made at the same time as consents are solicited
with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees so long as
Holders are not required to consent in such consent solicitation if such Holder tenders its Notes in the Change of
Control Offer. In addition, the Co-Issuers or any third party approved in writing by the Co-Issuers that is making the
Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Alternate Offer) may increase or decrease the
Change of Control Payment (or decline to pay any early tender premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its
sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including, but
not limited to, by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset Sales) at the time of such Asset
Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (as determined at the time of contractually agreeing to
such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration (as determined at
the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) for such Asset Sale, together with all other
Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount
of:

(a) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (in the case of
carrying value, as reflected on the Issuer’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the
footnotes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet,
such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet
or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the
date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes
or the Guarantee of the Notes, that are assumed or otherwise forgiven or discharged by the
transferee of any such assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the
transactions relating to such Asset Sale);

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents or by their terms are required to be satisfied by
cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each
case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value (with the Fair Market
Value of such item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time of
contractually agreeing to the related Asset Sale), taken together with all other Designated
Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding,
not to exceed the greater of (x) $215.0 million and (y) 17.0% of LTM EBITDA as of the
end of the Applicable Measurement Period at the time of contractually agreeing to such
Asset Sale;

173


-----

shall, in each case, for purposes of this clause (2), be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision
and for no other purpose.

Within 365 days after the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset
Sale (the “Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period”), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply
an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale:

(1) to the extent such Net Proceeds are from an Asset Sale of CF Debt Priority Collateral, to repay (a)
Obligations under the Notes or (b) First Lien Obligations (other than the Notes), and in the case of
revolving obligations (other than Obligations in respect of any asset-backed credit facility), to
correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; _provided_ that in the case of any
repayment pursuant to clause (b), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (1) reduce
Obligations under the Notes on an equal or ratable basis with any First Lien Obligations repaid
pursuant to clause (b) by, at its option (A) redeeming Notes as described under “—Optional
Redemption” or (B) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in arm’s length privately
negotiated transactions (which, in each case, may be below par) or (2) make an offer (in accordance
with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes
for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid
interest, if any, thereon;

(2) to the extent such Net Proceeds are from an Asset Sale of ABL Priority Collateral, to repay
(a) Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement, (b) Obligations under the Notes or (c) First Lien
Obligations (other than the Notes), and in the case of revolving obligations (other than (A)
Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement and (B) Obligations in respect of any asset-backed
credit facility), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; provided that in the
case of any repayment pursuant to clause (c), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (1)
reduce Obligations under the Notes on an equal or ratable basis with any First Lien Obligations
repaid (and in the case of revolving obligations, to correspondingly reduce commitments with
respect thereto) pursuant to clause (c) by, at its option (A) redeeming Notes as described under “—
Optional Redemption” or (B) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in arm’s length
privately negotiated transactions (which, in each case, may be below par) or (2) make an offer (in
accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase
their Notes for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but
unpaid interest, if any, thereon;

(3) if the assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale do not constitute Collateral, to repay:

(a) (i) Obligations under (x) the Notes and/or (y) the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
(ii) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility and/or
(iii) Obligations under any other Secured Indebtedness, and in each case, in the case of
revolving obligations (other than (A) Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement or (B)
obligations in respect of any asset-backed credit facility to the extent the assets sold or
otherwise disposed of in connection with such Asset Sale constituted “borrowing base
assets”), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(b) Obligations under any other Senior Indebtedness (other than any Senior Indebtedness
referred to in clause (a) above) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case
of revolving obligations (other than (A) Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement or
(B) obligations in respect of any asset-backed credit facility to the extent the assets sold or
otherwise disposed of in connection with such Asset Sale constituted “borrowing base
assets”), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); provided that the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce the aggregate principal amount
of Obligations under the Notes on an equal or ratable basis with any Senior Indebtedness
repaid pursuant to this clause (b) by, at its option, (x) redeeming Notes as provided under
“—Optional Redemption” and/or (y) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or
in privately negotiated transactions (which, in each case, may be below par) and/ or (B)

make an offer (in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer)
to all Holders to purchase their Notes, for no less than 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon up to the principal
amount of Notes to be repurchased, on an equal or ratable basis with any Senior
Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this clause (b) (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset
Sale Offer for purposes hereof); or

(c) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or a Co-Issuer, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in any
business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it
constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c)
acquisitions of other property or assets (other than Capital Stock), in the case of each of clauses (a),
(b) and (c), either (i) that is used or useful in a Similar Business or (ii) that replace the businesses,
properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided that, in the case of this
clause (4), a binding commitment or letter of intent shall be treated as a permitted application of the
Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation
that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within 180 days
of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and
such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset
Sale Proceeds Application Period (the period from the consummation of the Asset Sale to such date,
the “First Commitment Application Period”), and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later
cancelled or terminated for any reason after the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application
Period and before such Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Net Proceeds
shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary reasonably expects
to enter into another Acceptable Commitment prior to the expiration of the First Commitment
Application Period (a “Second Commitment”) and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such
manner prior to 180 days from the expiration of the First Commitment Application Period; provided,
_further, that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such_
Net Proceeds are applied or if such Second Commitment is not entered into prior to the expiration
of the First Commitment Application Period, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess
Proceeds to the extent the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period has expired; or

(5) any combination of the foregoing.

If an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from Asset Sales of Collateral are not invested or applied as provided
and within the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph, such amount will be deemed to constitute
“Collateral Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x)
$190.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the Co-Issuers shall, within ten Business Days, make an offer to all
Holders and, if required or permitted by the terms of other First Lien Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien
permitted under the Indenture on the assets disposed of (which Lien is not subordinate to the Lien of the Notes with
respect to the Collateral), to the holders of such other First Lien Obligations or such other Obligations (a “Collateral
_Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the_
Notes and such Indebtedness, with respect to the Notes only, that is equal to $250,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000
in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Collateral Excess Proceeds at an offer price, with respect to the
Notes only, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value, as applicable), plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the repurchase of such Notes pursuant to such
offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing
the applicable Indebtedness. The Co-Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds
from an Asset Sale of Collateral by making a Collateral Asset Sale Offer with respect to any Net Proceeds (the
“Collateral Advance Portion”) prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period with respect to
all or a part of the available Net Proceeds in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (the “Collateral
_Advance Offer”)._

If an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from Asset Sales of non-Collateral are not invested or applied as
provided and within the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph, such amount will be deemed to
constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of
(x) $190.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the Co-Issuers shall, within ten Business Days, make an offer to
all Holders and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Indebtedness that is pari passu in right of payment with
the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to
purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, with respect to the Notes only, that is equal to $250,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess
thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, with respect to the Notes only, in cash in
an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value, as applicable), plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the repurchase of such Notes pursuant to such offer, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Pari
Passu Indebtedness. The Co-Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds from an
Asset Sale of non-Collateral by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to any Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”)
prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period with respect to all or a part of the available Net
Proceeds in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (the “Advance Offer”).

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Proceeds of
any Asset Sale are received or deemed to be received by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is
(x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any
agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the
United States, the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this
covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the
applicable local law or regulation, applicable organizational, documents or other impediments will not permit
repatriation to the United States (the Co-Issuers hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the CoIssuers’ reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to within one year
following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions
reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational documents or other impediments to permit
such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have
been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law,
applicable organizational document or other impediments, such repatriation will be promptly effected and the amount
of such repatriated Net Proceeds will be promptly (and in any event not later than five Business Days after such
repatriation could be made) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether
or not repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Co-Issuers have
determined in good faith that repatriation of, or an obligation to repatriate, any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Foreign
Disposition could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of
doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment out of such Net Proceeds whereby doing so the Issuer, any of
its Subsidiaries, any Parent Entity or any of their respective Affiliates and/or direct or indirect equity owners would
incur a material Tax liability, including receipt of a material Tax dividend or a withholding Tax) taking into account
any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation, the Net Proceeds so affected
may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a
consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of
Default.

The Co-Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer or a Collateral Asset Sale Offer, as the case may be, by
transmitting electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC or by mailing the notice required
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount
(or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, other Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale
Offer or a Collateral Asset Sale Offer is less than, in the case of an Asset Sale Offer, the Excess Proceeds (or, in the
case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) or, in the case of a Collateral Asset Sale Offer, the Collateral Excess
Proceeds (or, in the case of a Collateral Advance Offer, the Collateral Advance Portion) (the “Declined Proceeds”),
the Co-Issuers may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion)
or Collateral Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of a Collateral Advance Offer, the Collateral Advance Portion) as
Declined Proceeds, and use such Declined Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate
principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes or other Indebtedness surrendered in an Asset Sale Offer
exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) or in a Collateral

176


-----

Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of a Collateral Advance Offer, the
Collateral Advance Portion), the Trustee shall select the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global
notes) and the Co-Issuers or the representative of such other Indebtedness shall select such other Indebtedness to be
purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes and such other
Indebtedness tendered, with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or other Indebtedness, as the case may be, will
be repurchased in an unauthorized denomination; provided that no Notes of $250,000 or less shall be repurchased in
part. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer or Collateral Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds or
Collateral Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero, and in the case of an Advance Offer or a Collateral Advance Offer,
the amount of Net Proceeds the Co-Issuers is offering to apply in such Advance Offer or Collateral Advance Offer
shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds or Collateral Excess Proceeds.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Co-Issuers or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving
credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Co-Issuers
or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may elect to invest in the Issuer and its Subsidiaries prior to receiving
the Net Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Sale (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than
execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Sale) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant
to and in accordance with clause (4) above with respect to such Asset Sale.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Co-Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to
have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Co-Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes.

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities limit, and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating
to Indebtedness to which a Co-Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may prohibit or limit, such Co-Issuer
from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In the event the Co-Issuers are contractually
prohibited from purchasing the Notes, a Co-Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, may seek the consent
of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition or
limitation. If such Co-Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, does not obtain such consent or repay such
borrowings, such Co-Issuer will remain contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the CoIssuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt,
the consummation of the Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Chewy Distribution) shall not be
prohibited by the covenants below under “—Certain Covenants.”

**_Suspension of Covenants When Notes Are Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the Issue Date:

(a) an Investment Grade Rating Event has occurred; and

(b) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, the occurrence of the events
described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant
_Suspension Event,” then beginning on such day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined_
below), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the
Indenture summarized under the following headings (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

          - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,”

177


-----

          - “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock,”

          - the provisions of clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation,
Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets,”

          - “—Transactions with Affiliates,”

          - “—Future Guarantors,”

          - “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” and

          - “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event (the date of such occurrence, the “Suspension Date”),
the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be set at zero. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not
subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date
(the “Reversion Date”) any of the Rating Agencies withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating
assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating following which the Notes do not have an Investment Grade
Rating from at least two Rating Agencies, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject
to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the
Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” Notwithstanding that the Suspended
Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date with respect to the Notes, (1) no Default, Event of Default or
breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist or have occurred under the Notes, the related Guarantees or the Indenture
relating to the Notes with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall
bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any
time pursuant to any contractual obligation entered into or arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a
result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the
Suspension Period or after that time, as a result of any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension
Period) and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without
causing a Default or Event of Default under the Notes, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual
commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby (including any Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) and such compliance and
performance and such consummation of transactions shall be deemed to have occurred during the Suspension Period.

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock issued, during the Suspension Period
(or deemed incurred or issued during the Suspension Period in connection with a Specified Transaction entered into
during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second
paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”
On the Reversion Date, all Liens created, incurred or assumed during the Suspension Period (or deemed, created,
incurred or assumed during the Suspension Period in connection with a Specified Transaction (including with respect
to a Specified Transaction entered during the Suspension Period)) in compliance with the Indenture will be deemed
to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that they are classified as permitted under clause (7) of the definition
of “Permitted Liens.” Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted
Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with
respect to a Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period). Accordingly, Restricted Payments made
during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first
paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be
reset at zero. No Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period, unless
such designation would have complied with the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” as if such covenant was in effect for the purposes of designating Unrestricted Subsidiaries from the Issue
Date to the date of such designation. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant
to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates.” Any encumbrance or

178


-----

restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses
(1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be
permitted pursuant to clause (a) of such covenant. No Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the
covenant described under “—Future Guarantors” on or after the Reversion Date with respect to any guarantee entered
into by such Subsidiary during the Suspension Period. All Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed
made in connection with a Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have
been made pursuant to clause (5) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens
permitted under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens). To the extent such covenant
and any Permitted Liens refer to one or more Suspended Covenants, such covenant or definition shall be interpreted
as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely
for purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other covenant).

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge
of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or
of the occurrence of a Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuer’s, or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of Equity Interests in
such Person’s capacity as a holder of such Equity Interests), including any dividend, payment or
distribution payable in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation other than:

(a) dividends, payments or distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other
than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer; or

(b) dividends, payments or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of
any dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of
securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share (taking into account any
Preferred Stock) of such dividend, payment or distribution in accordance with its Equity
Interests in such class or series of securities; or

(c) dividends or distributions payable to any Parent Entity to fund interest payments in respect
of Indebtedness of such Parent Entity which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

or any Parent Entity, including in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation, in
each case held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

retire for value, in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity,

(a) Indebtedness permitted to be incurred or issued under clauses (7), (8) and (9) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

-----

(b) the prepayment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, discharge or other
acquisition or retirement of Subordinated Indebtedness in anticipation of satisfying a
sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one
year of the date of prepayment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, discharge
or acquisition or retirement; or

(IV) make any Restricted Investment;

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any exceptions thereto in
such clauses (I) and (III) above) being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of such
Restricted Payment:

(1) in the case of a Restricted Payment under clauses (I) and (II) above, no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof and, in the case of a Restricted
Payment under clause (III) and clause (IV) above, no Event of Default described under clauses (1),
(2) or (6) of the first paragraph of “—Events of Default and Remedies” shall have occurred and be
continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof;

(2) in the case of amounts attributable to subclause (a) of clause (3) below, the Issuer could incur an
additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph under the “—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” covenant
immediately after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to such Restricted Payment; and

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made
by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date which have not been returned,

next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next
succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of (without duplication):

(a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer (including any predecessor of the Issuer)

of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”) from the issue

amounts in excess of the original amount of such Permitted Investment; plus

(f) the greater of (x) $260.0 million and (y) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA.

For the avoidance of doubt, the equity contribution to the Issuer on or about the Issue Date as part of the

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend or other distribution or the consummation of any irrevocable
redemption within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof or the giving of such irrevocable
notice, as applicable, if, at the date of declaration or the giving of such notice, such payment would

the giving of the notice of such redemption payment would have been deemed to be a Restricted
Payment at such time);

(2) (a) the redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, discharge or other acquisition or retirement
of any Equity Interests (“Treasury Capital Stock”) or Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or

Test Date, in the case of a Specified Transaction, or the date of the Restricted Payment of the assets or securities
proposed to be transferred or issued by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the
Restricted Payment.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer will not permit
any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the penultimate sentence of the
definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in
the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments in an amount
determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investment.” Such designation will be permitted only
if a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investments in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether pursuant
to this covenant or pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Investments,” and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the
definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants set forth in the Indenture.

If the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such
Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the provisions of the
Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture

187


-----

notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Issuer’s financial statements affecting
Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for any period.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any AHYDO Payment with respect
to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be
incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment
or Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (25) above or is entitled to be made
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of
“Permitted Investments,” the Issuer will be entitled to classify or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on
the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) among such clauses (1)
through (25) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” in a manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning
of the Applicable Measurement Period; provided, further, that the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock that may be incurred pursuant to the foregoing, together with any amounts incurred under clauses (14)
(other than subclause (d)) and (19) of the following paragraph, by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall

of such Indebtedness, the Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio of the Issuer for the Applicable
Measurement Period would be no greater than 2.75 to 1.00 outstanding at any one time; provided
that for purposes of determining the amount that may be incurred under clause (1)(iii), all

definition of “Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio”, and (Y) the ABL Credit Agreement by the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary and letters of credit, indemnities, guarantees, exposure transmittal
memoranda, bankers’ acceptances and similar forms of credit support issued or created thereunder

proceeds thereof are promptly deposited with the Trustee to satisfy and discharge the Notes or

Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance,” in each case in accordance with the Indenture; and

(30) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries arising pursuant to any Permitted
Tax Restructuring and related transactions.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (30) above or is entitled to be incurred
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will allocate, classify
and reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
(or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and will only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any
portion thereof) in one of the above clauses or paragraphs; _provided_ that (x) all Indebtedness
outstanding under the New Term Loan Credit Facility on the Issue Date after giving effect to the
Transactions will be treated as incurred under clause (1)(X)(i) of the preceding paragraph and may
not be reclassified and (y) all Indebtedness outstanding under the ABL Credit Agreement on the
Issue Date after giving effect to the Transactions will be treated as incurred under clause (1)(Y) of
the preceding paragraph and may not be reclassified; and

(2) the principal amount of Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock outstanding under any clause of this covenant shall be determined after giving effect to the
application of proceeds of any such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock to refinance
any such other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, as applicable, will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock for purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in
reliance upon a percentage of LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio in each case under clause (1)
of the second preceding paragraph is being refinanced under clause (1) of the second preceding paragraph and such
refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to
be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred, and permitted to be
incurred, under such clause (1) so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being
refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence. Any Refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock and any Indebtedness incurred to Refinance Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (4) and (12) above shall be permitted to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting
discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, dividends and fees, costs and expenses (including upfront fees, original issue
discount or similar fees) in connection with such Refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness or
liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated
by the Issuer based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock was deemed to be incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving

194


-----

credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is incurred to Refinance other
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency, and such Refinancing would
cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such Refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have
been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness or the liquidation
preference of such Disqualified Stock or such Preferred Stock being Refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest,
dividends and fees, costs and expenses (including upfront fees, original issue discount or similar fees) incurred in
connection with such Refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the
exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of any
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,
if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being Refinanced,
shall be calculated by the Issuer based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
Refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness
merely because it is unsecured or (2) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness
merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by sufficient collateral
or issued or guaranteed by other obligors.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Co-Issuers will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur or assume
any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, an “Initial Lien”) that secures obligations under any Indebtedness, on any
asset or property of a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor unless:

(1) in the case of Initial Liens on any Collateral, such Initial Lien expressly has Junior Lien Priority on
the Collateral relative to the Notes and the Guarantees; and

(2) in the case of any Initial Lien on any asset or property that is not Collateral, the Notes (or the related
Guarantee in the case of Liens on assets of a Guarantor) are equally and ratably secured with (or, in
the event the Lien relates to Subordinated Indebtedness, are secured on a senior basis to) the
obligations so secured.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall provide by its terms
that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of
the Initial Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes and the Guarantees. In addition, in the event that an
Initial Lien is or becomes a Permitted Lien, the Issuer may, at its option and without consent from any Holder, elect
to release and discharge any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph in respect
of such Initial Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original
issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

Ratio test or (y) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio test, in each case, set forth in the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” or

(b) either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or (y) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, in
each case, for the Applicable Measurement Period immediately after such transaction
would be equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or equal to or less than
the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, of the Issuer for the Applicable
Measurement Period immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,

Documents, the Successor Company will take such action as may be reasonably necessary to cause
such property and assets to be made subject to the Lien of the Security Documents in the manner
and to the extent required in the Indenture or any of the Security Documents and shall take all
reasonably necessary action so that such Lien is perfected to the extent required by the Security
Documents; and

(7) the Collateral owned by or transferred to the Successor Company shall: (a) continue to constitute

may be, under the Indenture and the Notes, and the Issuer or the Finance Issuer, as the case may be, will automatically
be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing
clauses (3) and (4),

(1) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or amalgamate with, merge into, wind up into or

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the sale,
disposition or transfer of a Guarantor, no Guarantor will, and the Co-Issuers will not permit any such Guarantor to,
consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, consummate a Division as the Dividing Person

substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee, and such Guarantor will
automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and, in each of the following cases, without regard to the requirements set forth in the
preceding paragraph, any Guarantor may (i) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into, wind up into or
consummate a Division as the Dividing Person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or

of the Issuer) determines in good faith that such action is in the best interests of the Issuer and is not materially
disadvantageous to the Holders.

All Assets” covenant, the Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Chewy Distribution and the
conversion of the Issuer to a limited liability company, including by merger into a newly-formed limited liability
company) will be permitted under the Indenture.

consideration in excess of the greater of (x) $130.0 million and (y) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA, unless:

(1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms, taken as a whole, that are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an
arm’s-length basis or, if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no comparable transaction is
available with which to compare such Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate Transaction is otherwise
fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view and when such
transaction is taken in its entirety; and

(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related
Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the greater of

complies with clause (1) above.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Issuer, if any.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) (a) transactions between or among the Issuer and a Restricted Subsidiary or between or among
Restricted Subsidiaries or, in any case, any entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result
of such transaction and (b) any merger, consolidation or amalgamation of the Issuer with or into any
Parent Entity; _provided_ that such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material
assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted

advisory and other fees, indemnities and expenses accrued in any prior year) and any termination
fees (including any such cash lump sum or present value fee upon the consummation of a corporate
event, including an initial public offering) to the Investors pursuant to the management and
monitoring agreement (or any amendment thereto or replacement thereof so long as any such
amendment or replacement is not materially disadvantageous, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity of the Issuer), to the Issuer when taken as a
whole, as compared to the management and monitoring agreement as in effect immediately prior to
such amendment or replacement), (b) the payment of indemnification and other similar amounts to
the Investors and reimbursement of expenses of the Investors, each case approved by, or pursuant
to arrangements approved by, the Board of Directors of the Issuer; and (c) payments by the Issuer

Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the
Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms

Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis;

(6) any agreement or arrangement as in effect as of the Issue Date (other than any agreement or
arrangement of the type described in clause (3) above), or any amendment thereto or replacement

Preferred Stock”; or (ii) capital markets Indebtedness of a Co-Issuer or any other Guarantor in an aggregate principal
amount in excess of $200.0 million (the Indebtedness in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively “Specified Indebtedness”)
unless such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days executes and delivers joinders to the Security Documents to the
extent required by the Security Documents and a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee
by such Restricted Subsidiary, except if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to
the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such
Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such
Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; provided that this covenant shall not be applicable (i) to any guarantee by
any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in
connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in the event that the
Guarantee of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes or the Indenture by such Restricted Subsidiary would not be
permitted under applicable law.

The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause or allow, as the case may be, any Subsidiary or any of its
Parent Entities that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case, such Subsidiary

or Parent Entity shall not be required to comply with the 60-day period described above and such Guarantee may be
released at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion so long as any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary then outstanding

Guarantee) assuming such Subsidiary were not a Guarantor at such time.

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer shall furnish:

corresponding financial information included or incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum); and

(b) promptly after the occurrence of any of the following events, all current reports that would be
required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K as in effect on the Issue Date (if the Issuer had been
a reporting company under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act):

information regarding executive compensation and related party disclosure related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A,
34-54302A and IC-27444A.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be required to (i) comply with Sections 302,
906 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or (ii) otherwise furnish any information, certificates or
reports required by Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K.

The Issuer will (1) distribute such reports and information electronically to the Trustee and (2) make available
such reports and information to any Holder, any bona fide prospective purchaser of the Notes (a “Prospective
_Purchaser”), any bona fide security analyst or any bona fide market maker by posting such reports and information_
on Intralinks or any comparable password protected online data system or on a public website (the “Noteholder
_Website”);_ _provided_ that the Issuer shall only be required to make readily available any password or other login
information to any such Holder, Prospective Purchaser, security analyst or market maker; provided, further, that such
Holders, Prospective Purchasers, security analysts and market makers shall agree to (i) treat all such reports (and the
information contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained
therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose
any such reports (and the information contained therein) and information. Notwithstanding any other provision in the
Indenture, the Issuer may deny access to the Noteholder Website or deny access to any competitively-sensitive
information and reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this covenant to any such Holder, Prospective Purchaser,
security analyst or market maker that is or may become a competitor of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to the extent
that the Issuer determines in good faith that such access or the provision of such information and reports to such Person
would be competitively harmful to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries.

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also:

(1) as promptly as reasonably practicable after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and quarterly report
required by clauses (a)(1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this “—Reports and Other Information”
covenant or such earlier time after the completion of such reporting period, hold a conference call
to discuss the results of operations for the relevant reporting period; and

(2) prior to the date of the conference call required to be held in accordance with clause (1) of this
paragraph, announce on the Noteholder Website the time and date of such conference call and either
include all information necessary to access the call or inform Holders, Prospective Purchasers,
securities analysts and market makers how they can obtain such information.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to prospective investors, upon
their request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so
long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

If the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Unrestricted
Subsidiaries if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual
and quarterly information required by clause (a) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements, in the footnotes thereto or in an “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations
of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

Any Parent Entity may satisfy the obligations of the Issuer set forth in this “—Reports and Other Information”
covenant by providing the requisite financial and other information of such Parent Entity instead of the Issuer;
_provided that if such Parent Entity is not a Guarantor, to the extent such Parent Entity holds assets (other than its direct_
or indirect interest in the Issuer) that exceeds the lesser of (i) 1.0% of Total Assets of such Parent Entity and (ii) 1.0%
of the total revenue for the preceding fiscal year of such Parent Entity, then such information related to such Parent
Entity shall be accompanied by consolidating information, which may be posted to the website of the Issuer (or any
Parent Entity) or on a non-public, password-protected website or online data system maintained by the Issuer (or any

205


-----

Parent Entity) or a third party, that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information of such Parent
Entity, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the
other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the preceding
sentence need not be audited or reviewed by the auditors.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the reports referred to clauses (a) and (b) of the first paragraph
of this covenant if the Issuer or any Parent Entity has filed reports containing such information (or any such
information of a Parent Entity in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph) with the SEC through
EDGAR.

The Trustee shall have no responsibility to determine if such reports and information have been filed with
the SEC. Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and its
receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable from information contained therein, including our compliance with any of our covenants under the
indenture or the notes (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers’ Certificates). The Trustee
shall not be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise, our compliance with the covenants
or with respect to any reports or other documents filed with the SEC on EDGAR or any website under the Indenture,
or participate in any conference calls.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer will not be deemed to have failed to comply with
any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” until 180 days
after the date any report hereunder is due.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this “—Reports and Other
Information” covenant and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal
of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes;

covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) or (2) above) contained in
the Indenture or the Notes or, in the case of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, contained in the
Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement; provided that no such notice may be given with
respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to the Holders, more than two years prior to
such notice;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there
is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by a Co-Issuer, any Guarantor or the
Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor or the payment of which is guaranteed by a Co-Issuer, any
Guarantor or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the
issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its
stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an
obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated

206


-----

final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such
Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving
effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
in the aggregate equal to the greater of (x) $420.0 million (or its foreign currency
equivalent) and (y) 33.0% of LTM EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement
Period or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) failure by a Co-Issuer, the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary to pay
final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of (x) $420.0 million (or its foreign currency
equivalent) and (y) 33.0% of LTM EBITDA (net of amounts covered by insurance as to which the
insurer has been notified of such judgment or order and has not denied its obligation), which final,
non-appealable judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60
days after such judgment becomes final and non-appealable, and in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such
judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to a Co-Issuer, any Significant Subsidiary
or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor;

(7) the Guarantee of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or the Affiliate Guarantee of the
Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect (except as
contemplated by the terms thereof or by the Indenture) or be declared null and void or any
responsible officer of any such Guarantor denies that it has any further liability under its Guarantee
or gives notice to such effect, other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all obligations under
the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance
with the Indenture; and

(8) other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture and discharge
of the Indenture with respect to the Notes or the release of such Collateral or the Pledged Chewy
Stock, as applicable, with respect to the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the
Security Documents,

(a) in the case of any security interest with respect to the Pledged Chewy Stock or other
Collateral having a fair market value in excess of 5% of Total Assets, individually or in the
aggregate, such security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to
be a valid and perfected security interest or shall be declared invalid or unenforceable and
any such default continues for 30 days after notice of such default shall have been given to
the Co-Issuers, or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor in respect of the Pledged Chewy
Stock, by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% of the principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture, except to the extent that any such default (A)
results from the failure of the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent to maintain possession of
certificates, promissory notes or other instruments actually delivered to it representing
securities pledged under the Security Documents or (B) to the extent relating to Collateral
consisting of real property, is covered by a title insurance policy with respect to such real
property and such insurer has not denied coverage;

(b) the Issuer, the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor or any Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any
security interest under any Security Document is invalid or unenforceable; or

(c) the Liens created by the Security Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and
perfected Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (to

207


-----

the extent perfection by filing, registration, recordation or possession is required by the
Indenture or the Security Documents) other than (i)(A) in accordance with the terms of the
relevant Security Document and the Indenture, (B) the satisfaction in full of all Obligations
under the Indenture or (C) any loss of perfection that results from the failure of the First
Lien Notes Collateral Agent to maintain possession of certificates delivered to it
representing securities pledged under the Security Documents and (ii) such default
continues for 30 days after notice of such default shall have been given to the Issuer by the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% of the principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
issued under the Indenture.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above with respect to the Issuer) occurs
and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture may (subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements) declare
the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes issued
under the Indenture to be due and payable immediately.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this
section with respect to the Issuer, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice.
The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event
of Default, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest. Any time period to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event
of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes issued thereunder by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive
any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default or
Event of Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any such Note held by a nonconsenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences with respect to the Notes, provided that such
rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of
Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting
payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded,
automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default
arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged;

(2) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be)
giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any
of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have
offered, and if requested, provided, to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or
expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due and subject
to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the
Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy;

208


-----

(3) such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer
of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes.
The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in
personal liability.

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default,
notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (other
than a Regulated Bank) (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such
Holder delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its
nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position
_Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of_
Default (a “Default Direction”) shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or
otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of
providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may
reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within
five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its
nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial
owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position
Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has
initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such
time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Default or Event of Default that resulted
from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be
automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically
reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes,
the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its
Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically stayed
and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder
Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification
Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder
Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the
remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such
Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default
shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee or the Collateral Agent, as applicable,
shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding
shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank.

209


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any
Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate
the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any
statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations
with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or
otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent shall have any liability or responsibility to the Issuer, any
Holder or any other Person in connection with any Noteholder Direction or to determine whether or not any Holder
has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the Indenture or any other
agreement.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding
compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days, upon becoming aware of any
Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default and the
proposed action by the Issuer.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder, member or
limited partner of the Issuer or any Guarantor (or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor) or any of their parent
companies shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors or the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor under the Notes, the Guarantees, the Affiliate Guarantee, the Indenture or the Security Documents or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.
Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws and it is the view of the SEC
that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Co-Issuers, the Guarantors and the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor under the
Indenture, the Notes and the Affiliate Guarantee will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released
upon payment in full of all of the Notes issued under the Indenture. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect
to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the Notes issued under the Indenture and have each Co-Issuer’s
and each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee of the Notes and the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Affiliate Guarantee of the Notes (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure
all then existing Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Co-Issuers’ obligations with respect to Notes issued under the Indenture concerning issuing
temporary Notes, registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, and the
Issuer’s obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Co-Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the Indenture
(“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default
or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including
bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under “—Events of
Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

210


-----

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes issued under
the Indenture:

(1) the Co-Issuers must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders,
cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be
sufficient (without consideration of reinvestment of interest), in the opinion of an Independent
Financial Advisor, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the Notes issued
under the Indenture on the stated maturity date or on the redemption date, as the case may be, of
such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes and the Issuer must specify whether such
Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; provided that upon any
redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be
sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee
equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any
deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only
required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously
with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium
Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Co-Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel from counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that,
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, (i) the Co-Issuers have received from, or there
has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service, a ruling or (ii) since the Issue
Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the
effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Co-Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion
of Counsel from counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that,
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Covenant Defeasance
and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other material agreement
or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which, a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by
which a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting from any borrowing of funds
to be applied to make such deposit required to effect such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance
and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the
granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(5) the Co-Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit
was not made by the Co-Issuers with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any
creditors of a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and

(6) the Co-Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
(which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

211


-----

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to the Notes issued thereunder,
when either:

(1) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed Notes
which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due
and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer and a Co-Issuer or any
Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust
funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, Government
Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient (without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest) to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness
on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal,
premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption, as the case may
be; _provided_ that, upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the
extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit
only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the
Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms
that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(b) the Co-Issuers have paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture;
and

(c) the Co-Issuers have delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the Redemption Date, as the case
may be.

In addition, the Co-Issuers must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee
stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been complied with.

Further, if the Indenture is discharged in accordance with the above, the Affiliate Guarantee and the Liens on
Pledged Chewy Stock securing the Notes will be automatically released and discharged.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes issued thereunder, any
related Guarantee and the Security Documents (including the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement) may
be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding, including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, the Notes, and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture,
the Notes issued thereunder or any related Guarantee may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture, other than Notes beneficially
owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates, including consents or waivers obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes.

212


-----

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder, an amendment or waiver may
not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of the Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement
or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating
to a Change of Control and Asset Sales) or reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any
Note or change the time at which any Note may be redeemed as described under “—Optional
Redemption”; provided that any amendment to the minimum notice requirement may be made with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding;

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on
the Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such
acceleration, or in respect of a covenant or provision contained in the Indenture, any Guarantee or
the Affiliate Guarantee which cannot be amended or modified without the consent of all affected
Holders;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights
of Holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions that would require the Holders’ consent
described in this paragraph;

(8) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture or any Note of any Holder to institute
suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such Holder’s
Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of any such Note or related Guarantee, or the Affiliate
Guarantee, that would adversely affect the Holders; or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, release the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary
from any of its Obligations under the Guarantee or the Indenture, or release the Chewy Stock
Affiliate Guarantor from the Affiliate Guarantee, or amend or modify any provisions relating to any
such release.

In addition, the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement that will govern the Chewy Stock Collateral
Pledge will provide by its terms that no amendments or waivers of the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement,
the Affiliate Guarantee or the Chewy Stock Collateral Pledge will be permitted, in each case, except in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture that are applicable to the Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may (A) make any change in any Security Document
or the provisions in the Indenture dealing with Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) or application of trust
proceeds of the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) with the effect of releasing the Liens on all or
substantially all of the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) which secure the Obligations in respect of the
Notes or (B) change or alter the priority of the Liens securing the Obligations in respect of the Notes in any material
portion of the Collateral (including the Pledged Chewy Stock) in any way adverse to the Holders in any material
respect, other than, in each case, as provided under the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the
Intercreditor Agreements.

213


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, any Co-Issuer, any Guarantor (with
respect to a Guarantee or the Indenture to which it is a party), the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor (with respect to
any Security Document to which it is a party) the Trustee and the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent may amend or
supplement the Indenture, the Notes, any related Guarantee, the Affiliate Guarantee and any Security Document
(including the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge Agreement):

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided, that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code);

(3) to comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation,
Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”;

(4) to provide for the assumption of a Co-Issuer’s, any Guarantor’s or the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor’s obligations to the Holders;

not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture, the Notes, any related Guarantee, the
Affiliate Guarantee or the Security Documents of any such Holder in any material respect;

(6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon a
Co-Issuer, any Guarantor or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor;

requirements thereof;

(10) to add a Guarantor or a parent guarantor under the Indenture;

(11) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Guarantees, the Affiliate Guarantee, the Notes or the
Security Documents to any provision of the “Description of Senior First Lien Notes” in this Offering
Memorandum;

(12) to amend the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes as permitted
by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and administration of the
Notes; provided, however, that such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights
of Holders to transfer Notes;

(13) to secure the Notes and/or the related Guarantees;

(14) to release any Guarantor or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor from its Guarantee pursuant to the
Indenture or from its Affiliate Guarantee pursuant to the Chewy Stock Guarantee and Pledge
Agreement, respectively, when permitted or required thereby;

214


-----

(17) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant any other Lien in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of
the Holders, as additional security for the payment and performance of all or any portion of the
Obligations, in any property or assets, including any which are required to be mortgaged, pledged
or hypothecated, or in which a Lien is required to be granted to or for the benefit of the Trustee or
the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the Indenture, any of the Security Documents or

pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements or to modify any such legend as required by the
Intercreditor Agreements.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment, supplement or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment, supplement or waiver.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made, notices
given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing. Notices sent by
overnight delivery service will be deemed given when delivered and notices given electronically will be deemed given
when sent. Notices otherwise given in accordance with the procedures of DTC will be deemed given on the date sent
to DTC. Notices required to be delivered to the Trustee or the First Lien Notes Collateral Agent will be effective upon
actual receipt.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a
creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect
of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if
it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes issued thereunder will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case
an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured) for which a responsible officer of the Trustee has actual
knowledge, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in
the conduct of such person’s own affairs.

Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder shall have offered, and, if requested, provided to
the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

**Foreign Currency Equivalents**

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction or amount (other than
the incurrence of Indebtedness), the U.S. dollar equivalent amount of any amount denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such transaction was entered
into. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture, no restriction or amount will be exceeded or deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

215


-----

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees and the Affiliate Guarantee will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

**Specified Transactions**

When calculating the availability under any basket, ratio or any financial metric under the Indenture or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture, in each case in connection with (a) any Limited Condition
Acquisition, (b) any repayment, redemption or repurchase of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock with
respect to which a notice of repayment or redemption (or similar notice), which may be conditional, has been delivered,
(c) any dividends or distributions on, or redemptions of equity, in each case requiring declaration in advance thereof,
(d) the making of any Asset Sale or any disposition excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale,” or (e) any other
transaction or plan undertaken or proposed to be undertaken in connection with such Limited Condition Acquisition
or any transaction set forth in clauses (b) through (d) (the transactions referred to in clauses (a) through (e),
collectively, the “Specified Transactions,” and each, a “Specified Transaction”) and any actions or transactions related
thereto, the date of determination of such basket, ratio or financial metric or whether any such Specified Transaction
is permitted (or any requirement or conditions therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of
any Default or Event of Default)) may, at the option of the Issuer, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, a Parent Entity
of the Issuer, any successor entity of any of the foregoing (including a third party) (the “Testing Party”) (which election
may be made on or prior to the date of consummation of such Specified Transaction), be the date the definitive
agreements for such Specified Transaction are entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of a binding offer,
launch of a “certain funds” tender offer), the date of declaration of such Restricted Payment, the date of the public
announcement of such Specified Transaction, or the date such notice, which may be conditional, of such repayment
or redemption in connection with a repayment, redemption or repurchase of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is given to the Holders of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (any such date,
the “Transaction Test Date”) and such baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall be calculated with such pro forma
adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definitions of
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio after giving
effect to such Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including any incurrence of Liens,
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if it occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes
of determining the ability to consummate any such Specified Transaction, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any
of such baskets, ratios or financial metrics are exceeded or otherwise have failed to be complied with as a result of
fluctuations in such basket, ratio or related financial metrics (including, but not limited to, due to fluctuations in
Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer, the target company or the Person that is otherwise
the subject of the Specified Transaction for the Applicable Measurement Period) subsequent to such date of
determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto, such baskets, ratios or financial metrics will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such
fluctuations and (y) such baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such
Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto except as contemplated in clause (a) of the
immediately succeeding proviso; provided, however, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal
quarters shall have become available subsequent to the date of determination, the Testing Party may elect, in its sole
discretion, to re-determine all such baskets, ratios and financial metrics on the basis of such financial statements, in
which case such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable Transaction Test Date for
purposes of such baskets, ratios and financial metrics, (b) if any ratios or financial metrics improve or baskets increase
as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios, financial metrics or baskets may be utilized, (c) if the Testing
Party elects to have such determinations occur at the Transaction Test Date, any such transactions (including the
Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto) shall be deemed to have occurred on the
Transaction Test Date and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets, ratios or financial
metrics under the Indenture after the Transaction Test Date and before the consummation of such Specified
Transaction unless and until such Specified Transaction has been abandoned, as determined by the Testing Party, prior
to the consummation thereof and (d) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
will be calculated using an assumed interest rate based on the indicative interest margin, as reasonably determined by
the Testing Party in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has exercised its option pursuant to
the foregoing and any Default or Event of Default occurs following the Transaction Test Date (including any new
Transaction Test Date) for the applicable Specified Transaction and prior to or on the date of the consummation of

216


-----

such Specified Transaction, any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred or be
continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Specified Transaction
is permitted under the Indenture.

**Certain Compliance Determinations**

The Indenture shall provide that any calculations or measure that is determined with reference to the Issuer’s

-----

on or prior to the Applicable Calculation Date, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro
_forma_ effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment of
Indebtedness, or such issuance, redemption or repurchase of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (in each case,
including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the

under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and

election of an Elected Amount and (iii) for subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Elected
Amount (if any) shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding.

For purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
Divisions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with
GAAP) and other operational changes that have been made by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary during the
Applicable Measurement Period or subsequent to such Applicable Measurement Period and on or prior to the
Applicable Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, Divisions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations and other operational
changes (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in Consolidated EBITDA resulting
therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the Applicable Measurement Period; provided, subject to the proviso to
the first sentence of the immediately following paragraph, that any such adjustments may be incremental to (but not

or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period) shall have made any Investment,
acquisition, disposition, Division, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation or operational change
that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such Applicable Measurement Period as if such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, Division, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation or operational changes had
occurred at the beginning of the Applicable Measurement Period. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a
Subsidiary was previously designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary but was redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary
during or subsequent to the Applicable Measurement Period and is a Restricted Subsidiary as of the Applicable
Calculation Date, the computation referred to above shall be calculated on a _pro forma_ basis assuming that such
redesignation as a Restricted Subsidiary (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and any change in
Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the Applicable Measurement Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever _pro forma_ effect is to be given to a transaction, the _pro forma_
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (and may include,
for the avoidance of doubt and without duplication, cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies resulting
from any Asset Sale or other disposition or such Investment, acquisition, disposition, Division, merger, amalgamation
or consolidation, discontinued operation, operational change, new contract or other transaction (including the
Transactions, and such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies, collectively “Specified
_Adjustments”), in each case calculated in accordance with and permitted by clause (b) of the definition of_
“Consolidated EBITDA,” which is being given _pro forma_ effect that have been or are expected to be realized);
_provided, that the Specified Adjustments made pursuant to this paragraph are reasonably anticipated to result from_
actions taken or to be taken (in the good faith determination of the Issuer) within 24 months after the consummation
of any transaction or change that is expected to result in such Specified Adjustment. If any Indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if
the rate in effect on the Applicable Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into
account for such entire period, any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness with a remaining term of 12
months or longer, and in the case of any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness with a remaining term
of less than 12 months, taking into account such Hedging Obligation to the extent of its remaining term). Interest on

241


-----

a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible
financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in
accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, except as set forth in the first
paragraph of this definition, interest on any Indebtedness under revolving credit facilities computed on a pro forma
basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period or, if
lower, the maximum commitments under such revolving credit facilities as of the Applicable Calculation Date. Interest
on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a
eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen,
or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

are in effect from time to time; provided that all terms of an accounting or financial nature used in the Indenture shall
be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to in the Indenture shall be made (a) without giving
effect to any election under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 825—Financial Instruments, or any successor
thereto or comparable accounting principle (including pursuant to the Accounting Standards Codification), to value
any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein and (b) the amount of any
Indebtedness under GAAP with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations shall be determined in accordance with the
definition of Capitalized Lease Obligations. At any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect to apply IFRS
accounting principles in lieu of GAAP and, upon any such election, references herein to GAAP shall thereafter be
construed to mean IFRS (except as otherwise provided in the Indenture); provided that any such election, once made,
shall be irrevocable; provided, further, any calculation or determination in the Indenture that requires the application
of GAAP for periods that include fiscal quarters ended prior to the Issuer’s election to apply IFRS shall remain as
previously calculated or determined in accordance with GAAP. The Issuer shall give notice of any such election made
in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, solely making an election (without any
other action) referred to in this definition will not be treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness. If there occurs a change
in IFRS or GAAP, as the case may be, and such change would cause a change in the method of calculation of any
standards, terms or measures (including all computations of amounts and ratios) used in the Indenture (an “Accounting
_Change”), then the Issuer may elect that such standards, terms or measures shall be calculated as if such Accounting_
Change had or had not occurred.

guarantor of the Notes with such guarantor being automatically and unconditionally released if certain events occur
as described below.

Each of the Guarantees of each Guarantor will be:

270


-----

     - a senior unsecured obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

     - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of that Guarantor,_
including the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes;

     - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including
its guarantee of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New ABL Facility and the Secured
Notes) to the extent of the value of the assets of such Guarantor securing such Indebtedness; and

     - senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined with
respect to the Notes) of that Guarantor.

The Affiliate Guarantee will be:

     - a senior unsecured obligation of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor;

     - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Chewy Stock_
Affiliate Guarantor, including the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes;

     - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Secured Indebtedness of the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor (including its guarantee of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New ABL
Facility and the Secured Notes) to the extent of the value of the assets of the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor securing such Indebtedness; and

     - senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined with
respect to the Notes) of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor.

In the future, certain Subsidiaries may not Guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be structurally subordinated
to Indebtedness and other liabilities of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than Finance Issuer) that do not Guarantee the
Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, such
Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to
distribute any of their assets to either Co-Issuer or any other Guarantor. None of our Subsidiaries that is an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, a Foreign Subsidiary, a FSHCO or a Receivables Subsidiary will guarantee the Notes.

Prior to the consummation of this offering, Chewy and its Subsidiaries were non-guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer. Following consummation of this offering, Chewy and its Subsidiaries will no longer be
Subsidiaries of the Issuer and will not provide any credit support for the Notes.

We do not expect to have any Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries as of the Issue Date, other than (i) our whollyowned Foreign Subsidiaries, PetSmart Puerto Rico, LLC, a Puerto Rican limited liability company, PETM Canada
Corporation, a Nova Scotia company, PS Netherlands Holdings, C.V., a Dutch limited partnership, and PetSmart
International Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong limited company, PetSmart Pet Supplies (Shanghai) Limited, a
Shanghai joint stock limited company, (ii) our FSHCOs, PetSmart Netherlands C.V.-L.P., LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, PetStuff Canada (USA) Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, PetSmart International Holdings
II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and PetSmart International Holdings I LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, and (iii) Chewy Pharmacy KY, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and any other Pharmacy
Subsidiary.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee (and the obligations of the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor under the Affiliate Guarantee) will be limited as necessary to prevent such Guarantee or the Affiliate
Guarantee of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law;
this limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such Guarantee or the Affiliate Guarantee of the Chewy Stock
Affiliate Guarantor from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its
Guarantee (or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor under its Affiliate Guarantee) will be entitled upon payment in
full of all guaranteed Obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor (or the Chewy Stock

271


-----

Affiliate Guarantor) in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor’s pro rata
portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors and the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor (including any successors and assigns) at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

If a Guarantee or the Affiliate Guarantee is rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other
indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable Guarantor or the Chewy Stock
Affiliate Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee or
the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor’s liability on its Affiliate Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a
court to void the notes and/or the note guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”

A Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged:

(a) in the case of a Guarantor, upon any sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or other disposition
(by merger, consolidation, amalgamation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (x) the
Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any sale, exchange or transfer), after which the
applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (y) all or substantially all of
the assets of such Guarantor, in each case, if such sale, exchange, issuance, transfer or other
disposition is not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture (including any
amendments thereof);

(b) (i) upon the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor with respect to the
New Term Loan Credit Facility, (ii) upon the release or discharge of such other guarantee
that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, or (iii) if, at the time of such release and
discharge and assuming such Guarantor were not then a Guarantor under the Indenture,
such Guarantor would not have been required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the
provisions described in “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors,” except, in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii), a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee
(it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still a release);

(c) in the case of a Guarantor, upon the designation of such Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(d) upon exercise of the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option by the CoIssuers as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the CoIssuers’ obligations under the Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture;

(e) upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation, winding up or Division of any Guarantor
with and into a Co-Issuer or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, winding up or Division, upon the liquidation of such
Guarantor or upon the transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to a Co-Issuer or
another Guarantor;

(f) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; provided that (i) such Guarantee shall not
be released pursuant to this clause (f) for so long as such Guarantor is an obligor with
respect to any Indebtedness under the New Term Loan Credit Facility and (ii) such
Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date; or

(g) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”

In addition, the Affiliate Guarantee of the Notes by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor will provide by its
terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:

272


-----

(a) on the first date on which the Issuer’s Consolidated Total Debt Ratio is equal to or less
than 2.00:1.00 (and such Affiliate Guarantee will not later be reinstated, even if the Issuer’s
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio later exceeds 2.00:1.00);

(b) upon the release or discharge of the guarantee by the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor with
respect to the New Term Loan Credit Facility;

(c) upon exercise of the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option by the CoIssuers as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the CoIssuers’ obligations under the Indenture being discharged in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture; or

(d) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”

**The Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor**

The Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor will initially be a guarantor of the Notes. The Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor has no independent operations and will have no material assets other than its ownership of the Pledged
Chewy Stock, which will be pledged to secure the Secured Notes, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other
first lien obligations on a first-priority basis, and the New ABL Facility on a second-priority basis. The Notes will not
benefit from any security interest in the Pledged Chewy Stock.

Indebtedness not prohibited by the Indenture or any Lien described below;

(c) create, incur or assume any Lien on the Pledged Chewy Stock that secures obligations under any
Indebtedness, other than (A) Liens in respect of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
Secured Notes, the new ABL facility and any other secured Indebtedness, to the extent not
prohibited by the Indenture, and (B) Permitted Encumbrances;

(d) sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Pledged Chewy Stock, except (A) pursuant to

(B) in compliance with clause (e) below; or

(e) consolidate or amalgamate with, or merge with or into, or convey, sell or otherwise transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to, any other Person or permit any other Person to merge into or
consolidate or amalgamate with it, in one or more related transactions, unless (A) the surviving
Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger, or to
which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made
is an Affiliate of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor organized or existing under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof (such Person, as
the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor”), (B) the

273


-----

Successor Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor complies with the requirements set forth in clauses (a),
(b) and (c) above upon the effectiveness of the applicable transaction (as if all outstanding
Indebtedness and Liens of such assignee were incurred at such time), (C) the Successor Chewy
Stock Affiliate Guarantor expressly assumes all the obligations of the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor under the Chewy Stock Guarantee Agreement pursuant to documents or instruments in
form substantially similar to the documents or instruments delivered to the administrative agent
under the New Term Loan Credit Facility, and (D) the Successor Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor
shall hold the Pledged Chewy Stock upon the effectiveness of the applicable transaction pursuant to
the terms of the Chewy Stock Guarantee Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Description of Senior Unsecured Notes, the Chewy
Stock Affiliate Guarantor may assign all of its rights and obligations under the Chewy Stock Guarantee Agreement,
and the Pledged Chewy Stock may be transferred, subject to the pledge, directly or indirectly, to any other Person that
is an Affiliate of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor that is organized or existing under the laws of the United States,
any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof, provided that (A) such assignee complies with the
requirements set forth in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above upon the effectiveness of such assignment (as if all outstanding
Indebtedness and Liens of such assignee were incurred at such time), (B) such assignee expressly assumes all the
obligations of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor under the Chewy Stock Guarantee Agreement pursuant to
customary documents or instruments in form substantially similar to the documents or instruments delivered to the
administrative agent under the New Term Loan Credit Facility and (C) such assignee shall hold the Pledged Chewy
Stock upon the effectiveness of such assignment pursuant to the terms of the Chewy Stock Guarantee Agreement.
Further, upon the effectiveness of such assignment to an assignee, the assignor will be automatically and
unconditionally released from the Chewy Stock Collateral Pledge and the Affiliate Guarantee pursuant to the terms of
the Chewy Stock Guarantee Agreement.

The Indenture and the Chewy Stock Guarantee Agreement will provide that the Affiliate Guarantee will be
automatically and unconditionally released on the first date after the Issue Date on which the Consolidated Total Debt
Ratio of the Issuer is equal to or less than 2.00:1.00.

By their acceptance of the Notes, each Holder will be deemed to accept the terms of, agree to be bound by
and authorize and direct the Trustee to enter into and perform its obligations under the Chewy Stock Guarantee
Agreement and any amendment, supplement or joinder permitted thereby.

PetSmart” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations” in this
offering memorandum. For a description of Chewy’s Class A common stock, see Exhibit 4.1 to Chewy’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020.

**Ranking**

The Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Guarantees will be Senior Indebtedness of the Co-Issuers
or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, and will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future
Senior Indebtedness of the Co-Issuers or such Guarantor, as the case may be, including the obligations under our New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes. The Obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the
Guarantees will be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ existing
and future Secured Indebtedness, including the obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness. The Indebtedness evidenced by the
Affiliate Guarantee will be Senior Indebtedness of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, and will rank equal in right
of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, including the
guarantee of the obligations under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New ABL Facility, and the Secured
Notes. The phrase “in right of payment” refers to the contractual ranking of a particular Obligation, regardless of
whether an Obligation is secured.

Substantially all of the operations of the Issuer are conducted through the Issuer’s Subsidiaries. Not all of the
Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes, and as described under “—Guarantees,” Guarantees may be

274


-----

released under certain circumstances. In addition, some or all of the Issuer’s future Subsidiaries may not be required
to guarantee the Notes. Unless the Subsidiary is a Guarantor or a Co-Issuer, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries,
including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority
with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Co-Issuers and the
Guarantors, including the Holders of the Notes, even if such claims do not constitute Senior Indebtedness. The Notes,
therefore, will be structurally subordinated to holders of Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors)
and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than Finance Issuer) that are not Guarantors,
other than Indebtedness and liabilities owed to a Co-Issuer or a Guarantor.

As of November 1, 2020, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions:

(1) the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors would have had:

     - (i) $3,500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness secured on a first-priority basis by
CF Debt Priority Collateral and on a second-priority basis by ABL Priority Collateral, consisting of
Secured Indebtedness under the New Term Loan Credit Facility and the Secured Notes, (ii) no
Indebtedness under the ABL Credit Agreement (without giving effect to $62.0 million of letters of
credit that are expected to remain outstanding under the new ABL Credit Agreement) secured on a
first-priority basis by ABL Priority Collateral and on a second-priority basis by CF Debt Priority
Collateral and (iii) $750.0 million of additional revolving borrowing capacity under the ABL Credit
Agreement (excluding $62.0 million of letters of credit that are expected to remain outstanding
under the new ABL Credit Agreement); and

     - $1,150.0 million outstanding unsecured senior Indebtedness for borrowed money, consisting of the
Notes; and

(2) the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor would have had: (i) $3,500.0 million aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness secured on a first-priority basis by the Pledged Chewy Stock, consisting of Secured
Indebtedness under the New Term Loan Credit Facility and the Secured Notes, (ii) no Indebtedness under
the ABL Credit Agreement (without giving effect to $62.0 million of letters of credit that are expected to
remain outstanding under the new ABL Credit Agreement) secured on a second-priority basis by the Pledged
Chewy Stock, (iii) $750.0 million of additional revolving borrowing capacity under the ABL Credit
Agreement (excluding $62.0 million of letters of credit that are expected to remain outstanding under the
new ABL Credit Agreement), and (iv) $1,150.0 million outstanding unsecured senior Indebtedness for
borrowed money, consisting of the Notes; and

(3) the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries would have had $22.7 million of Indebtedness (excluding
intercompany liabilities).

Although (i) the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness or Disqualified
Stock that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur or issue, as the case may be, and the issuance of
Preferred Stock by the Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) the Chewy Stock Guarantee Agreement will contain limitations
on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor may incur, such limitations are
subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications. The amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock that may be incurred or issued in compliance with the covenants could be substantial and in certain
circumstances, may be Secured Indebtedness. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Co-Issuers will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes. The initial
Paying Agent for the Notes will be the Trustee.

The Co-Issuers will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”). The Co-Issuers will also
maintain a transfer agent. The initial Registrar will be the Trustee. The initial transfer agent will be the Trustee. The

275


-----

Registrar and the transfer agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of any Notes in certificated, non-global
form outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of such Notes in certificated,
non-global form on the behalf of the Co-Issuers.

The Co-Issuers may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the transfer agents without prior notice to
the Holders. Either the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries may act as a Paying Agent or Registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the restriction set out in the
section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Transfer Restrictions.” The Registrar and the Trustee may require a
Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer
of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. None of the Co-Issuers nor the Trustee will be
required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in
connection with a Change of Control Offer, an Alternate Offer, an Asset Sale Offer, an Advance Offer or other tender
offer. Also, the Co-Issuers and the Trustee will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15
days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed. The registered Holder will be treated as the owner of the Note for all
purposes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Co-Issuers will issue $1,150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The Notes
will mature on       , 2029. Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” the
Co-Issuers may issue additional Notes from time to time after this offering under the Indenture (“Additional Notes”).
It is intended, to the maximum extent possible, the Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently issued
under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers,
amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Notes” for all
purposes of the Indenture, the Guarantees and this “Description of Senior Unsecured Notes” include any Additional
Notes that are actually issued. If any Additional Notes are not part of the same issue as the Notes offered hereby under
the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if the Co-Issuers otherwise determine that any Additional Notes
should be differentiated from any other Notes, such Additional Notes will have a separate CUSIP number; provided
that such Additional Notes and all other Notes will still constitute a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate of    % per annum and will be payable in cash semi-annually in
arrears on        and       , commencing on       , 2021, to the Holders of record on the immediately
preceding                        and       , as the case may be. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the
most recent date on which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date.
Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30 day months. Each
interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the CoIssuers maintained for such purpose as described under “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” or, at the option
of the Co-Issuers, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their respective addresses set
forth in the register of Holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to
the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by The Depository Trust Company
(“DTC”) or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the
Holder or Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Co-Issuers, the Co-Issuers’ office or agency will be the
office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. If any interest payment date, the maturity date or any earlier required
repurchase or Redemption Date falls on a day that is a Legal Holiday, the required payment will be made on the next
succeeding Business Day and no interest on such payment or other payment will accrue in respect of the delay. The
Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $250,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of
$250,000.

276


-----

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Co-Issuers will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Co-Issuers may be required to offer to purchase Notes
as described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” The Issuer and its Affiliates may at any time
and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below and in the fourth paragraph under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Change of Control,” the Co-Issuers will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at their option prior to       , 2024.

At any time prior to       , 2024, the Co-Issuers may, at their option and on one or more occasions, redeem
all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption (any applicable date of redemption hereunder, the
“Redemption Date”), subject to the rights of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Redemption Date.

On and after       , 2024, the Co-Issuers may, at their option and on one or more occasions, redeem the
Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” at the redemption
prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to
the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on        of each of the years
indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2024 ........................................................................................................................................... %
2025 ........................................................................................................................................... %
2026 and thereafter .................................................................................................................... 100.000%

In addition, until       , 2024, the Co-Issuers may, at their option, upon notice as described under the
heading “—Selection and Notice,” on one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of
Notes (including Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to    % of the aggregate
principal amount thereof, with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds from one or more Equity
Offerings, to the extent such net cash proceeds are received by or contributed to a Co-Issuer, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the
Redemption Date; provided that (a) at least 50% of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally
issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date (but excluding any Additional Notes issued under the Indenture after the
Issue Date) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption unless all such Notes are
redeemed substantially concurrently and (b) each such redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of closing of
each such Equity Offering.

Notice of any redemption of, or any offer to purchase, the Notes may, at the Co-Issuers’ discretion, be given
in connection with an Equity Offering, other transaction (or series of related transactions) or an event that constitutes
a Change of Control and prior to the completion or the occurrence thereof, and any such redemption or purchase may,
at the Co-Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion
or occurrence of the related Equity Offering, transaction or event, as the case may be. In addition, if such redemption
or purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such
condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Co-Issuers’ discretion, the Redemption Date or purchase date may
be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase
was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or

277


-----

waived, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all
such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Redemption Date or purchase date or by the Redemption
Date or purchase date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Co-Issuers’ discretion
if the Co-Issuers reasonably believe that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the
Co-Issuers may provide in such notice or offer that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of
the Co-Issuers’ obligations with respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender
offer and the Co-Issuers, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Co-Issuers, purchases all of the
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Co-Issuers or such third party will have the right upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days following such repurchase date, to
redeem (with respect to the Co-Issuers) or repurchase (with respect to a third party) all Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such tender offer (which may be
less than par and shall exclude any early tender premium or similar premium and any accrued and unpaid interest paid
to any Holder in such tender offer payment) plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the Redemption Date or purchase date, subject to the right of Holders
of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling
on or prior to the Redemption Date or purchase date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a
tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer, Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as applicable, Notes owned
by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by an Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof,
shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer,
Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as applicable.

The Issuer and its Affiliates may acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer,
open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise so long as such acquisition does not otherwise violate the
terms of the Indenture.

**_Selection and Notice_**

With respect to any partial redemption or purchase of Notes made pursuant to the Indenture, selection of the
Notes for redemption or purchase will be made on a pro rata basis to the extent applicable or by lot or by such method
as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided that if the Notes are represented by global notes, interests in
the Notes shall be selected for redemption or purchase by DTC in accordance with its standard procedures therefor;
_provided, further, that no Notes of less than $250,000 can be redeemed or repurchased in part._

Notices of purchase or redemption shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 10 days and not more than 60 days before the purchase or Redemption Date to each Holder at such
Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC (with a copy to the Trustee),
except that notices of redemption may be delivered or mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the
notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or as set
forth in the fifth paragraph under the heading “—Optional Redemption.” If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed
in part only, any notice of offer to purchase or redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the
principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed.

If any Notes are to be purchased or redeemed in part only, the Co-Issuers will issue a new Note in principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of
the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption, unless such redemption
is conditioned (in accordance with the Indenture) on the happening of a future event. On and after the Redemption
Date, unless the Co-Issuers default in payment of the redemption price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or
portions thereof called for redemption, unless such redemption is conditioned (in accordance with the Indenture) on
the happening of a future event.

The Co-Issuers may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a
single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any

278


-----

such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different redemption dates
and, with respect to redemptions that occur on the same date, may specify the order in which such redemptions are
deemed to occur.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Issue Date, unless the Co-Issuers have,
prior to or concurrently with the time the Co-Issuers are required to make a Change of Control Offer, delivered
electronically or sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional
Redemption” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” the Co-Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes
pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof (or such higher amount as the Co-Issuers may determine (any Change of Control Offer at a
higher amount, an “Alternate Offer”)) (such price, the “Change of Control Payment”) plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date
(as defined below). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except in the case of a conditional Change of
Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below, the Co-Issuers will send notice of such
Change of Control Offer by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder to the address of such Holder
appearing in the security register or otherwise electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with a copy
to the Trustee with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Change of
Control,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be
accepted for payment by the Co-Issuers;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 Business Days nor later
than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); provided
that the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed, in the Co-Issuers’ discretion, until such
time (including more than 60 days after the date such notice is sent) as any or all such conditions
referred to in clause (7) below shall be satisfied or waived;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that, unless the Co-Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes
accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the
Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on
the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the
paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business
on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that if less than all of such Holder’s Notes are tendered for purchase, such Holder will be issued new
Notes (or, in the case of global notes, such Notes shall be reduced by such amount of Notes that the
Holder has tendered) and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered (the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $250,000
or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof);

(7) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control (or such other conditions
specified therein and shall describe each such condition), and, if applicable, shall state that, in the
Co-Issuers’ discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time

279


-----

(including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered) as any and all such conditions
shall be satisfied or waived, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded
in the event that the Co-Issuers reasonably believe that any or all such conditions (including the
occurrence of such Change of Control) will not be satisfied or waived by the Change of Control
Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and

(8) the other instructions, as determined by the Co-Issuers, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder
must follow.

While the Notes are in global form and the Co-Issuers make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes through the
facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Co-Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by them or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with
an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered
to and purchased by the Co-Issuers.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Co-Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to
have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

With respect to the Notes, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Co-Issuers, or any third
party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Co-Issuers as described below, purchases all of the Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the holders of such series of Notes will be deemed to have
consented to such tender or other offer and accordingly, the Co-Issuers or such third party will have the right, upon
not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days following such purchase
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem (with respect to the Co-Issuers) or purchase (with
respect to a third party) all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase on a date (the “Second Change of
_Control Payment Date”) at a price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment in respect of the Second_
Change of Control Payment Date, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Second
Change of Control Payment Date, subject to the right of Holders of record of Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the Second Change of Control Date. In
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the
Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to
be outstanding for the purposes of such Change of Control Offer.

Agreements relating to Indebtedness to which a Co-Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may
prohibit or limit, such Co-Issuer from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change
of Control occurs at a time when the Co-Issuers are contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Co-Issuers
could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings
that contain such prohibition. If the Co-Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Co-Issuers
will remain contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Co-Issuers’ failure to purchase
tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture.

280


-----

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide, and any future credit agreements or other agreements
relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change
of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under
the Indenture). If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under our New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and/or such other agreement, we may seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance our New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and/or the Indebtedness governed by such other agreements. In the event we do not obtain
such a waiver or refinance the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and/or such other agreements or repurchase such
Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and/or
such other agreements being declared due and payable.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by
our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any
required repurchases of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes— We may
not be able to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required by the indentures that will govern the notes.”

In the event that we make a Change of Control Payment, we will pay (or cause the paying agent to pay) to
each Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate a new Note
equal in principal amount to any portion of the Notes surrendered that have not been tendered by the Holders, if any;
_provided that each such new Note must be in a principal amount of $250,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in_
excess thereof. The Co-Issuers will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as
practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity) and, thus, the removal of incumbent management.
We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although
it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the
future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not
constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at
such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.

Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of
the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford
Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party
approved in writing by the Co-Issuers makes the Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Alternate Offer) in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the
Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control
Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Alternate Offer) may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditional upon such Change of Control and such other conditions specified therein, if a definitive agreement is in
place for the Change of Control at the time of the making of such Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than a Permitted Holder. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer. As a result, it
may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Co-Issuers to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Co-Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of Change of Control, may be waived or modified

281


-----

with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. A Change of Control Offer
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Alternate Offer) may be made at the same time as consents are solicited
with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees so long as
Holders are not required to consent in such consent solicitation if such Holder tenders its Notes in the Change of
Control Offer. In addition, the Co-Issuers or any third party approved in writing by the Co-Issuers that is making the
Change of Control Offer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Alternate Offer) may increase or decrease the
Change of Control Payment (or decline to pay any early tender premium) being offered to Holders at any time in its
sole discretion, so long as the Change of Control Payment is at least equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
consummate, directly or indirectly, an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including, but
not limited to, by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset Sales) at the time of such Asset
Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (as determined at the time of contractually agreeing to
such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration (as determined at
the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) for such Asset Sale, together with all other
Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount
of:

(a) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (in the case of
carrying value, as reflected on the Issuer’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the
footnotes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet,
such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet
or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the
date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes
or the Guarantee of the Notes, that are assumed or otherwise forgiven or discharged by the
transferee of any such assets (or are otherwise extinguished in connection with the
transactions relating to such Asset Sale);

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents or by their terms are required to be satisfied by
cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each
case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value (with the Fair Market
Value of such item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time of
contractually agreeing to the related Asset Sale), taken together with all other Designated
Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding,
not to exceed the greater of (x) $215.0 million and (y) 17.0% of LTM EBITDA as of the
end of the Applicable Measurement Period at the time of contractually agreeing to such
Asset Sale;

shall, in each case, for purposes of this clause (2), be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision
and for no other purpose.

282


-----

Within 365 days after the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset
Sale (the “Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period”), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply
an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale:

(1) to repay:

(a) (i) Obligations under (x) the Secured Notes and/or (y) the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, (ii) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a Credit
Facility and/or (iii) Obligations under any other Secured Indebtedness, and in each case, in
the case of revolving obligations (other than (A) Obligations under the ABL Credit
Agreement or (B) obligations in respect of any asset-backed credit facility to the extent the
assets sold or otherwise disposed of in connection with such Asset Sale constituted
“borrowing base assets”), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(b) Obligations under any other Senior Indebtedness (other than any Senior Indebtedness
referred to in clause (a) above) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case
of revolving obligations (other than (A) Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement or
(B) obligations in respect of any asset-backed credit facility to the extent the assets sold or
otherwise disposed of in connection with such Asset Sale constituted “borrowing base
assets”), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); provided that the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce the aggregate principal amount
of Obligations under the Notes on an equal or ratable basis with any Senior Indebtedness
repaid pursuant to this clause (b) by, at its option, (x) redeeming Notes as provided under
“—Optional Redemption” and/or (y) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or
in privately negotiated transactions (which, in each case, may be below par) and/ or (B)
make an offer (in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer)
to all Holders to purchase their Notes, for no less than 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon up to the principal
amount of Notes to be repurchased, on an equal or ratable basis with any Senior
Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this clause (b) (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset
Sale Offer for purposes hereof); or

(c) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or a Co-Issuer, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in any
business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it
constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c)
acquisitions of other property or assets (other than Capital Stock), in the case of each of clauses (a),
(b) and (c), either (i) that is used or useful in a Similar Business or (ii) that replace the businesses,
properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided that, in the case of this
clause (2), a binding commitment or letter of intent shall be treated as a permitted application of the
Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation
that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within 180 days
of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and
such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset
Sale Proceeds Application Period (the period from the consummation of the Asset Sale to such date,
the “First Commitment Application Period”), and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later
cancelled or terminated for any reason after the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application
Period and before such Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Net Proceeds
shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary reasonably expects
to enter into another Acceptable Commitment prior to the expiration of the First Commitment
Application Period (a “Second Commitment”) and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such
manner prior to 180 days from the expiration of the First Commitment Application Period; provided,

283


-----

_further, that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such_
Net Proceeds are applied or if such Second Commitment is not entered into prior to the expiration
of the First Commitment Application Period, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess
Proceeds to the extent the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period has expired; or

(3) any combination of the foregoing.

If an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from Asset Sales are not invested or applied as provided and within
the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph, such amount will be deemed to constitute “Excess
_Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) $190.0 million and (y) 15.0%_
of LTM EBITDA, the Co-Issuers shall, within ten Business Days, make an offer to all Holders and, if required or
permitted by the terms of any Indebtedness that is _pari passu_ in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu
_Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to purchase the maximum_
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, with
respect to the Notes only, that is equal to $250,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, with respect to the Notes only, in cash in an amount equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value, as applicable), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but excluding, the date fixed for the repurchase of such Notes pursuant to such offer, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Pari Passu Indebtedness.
The Co-Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making
an Asset Sale Offer with respect to any Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale
Proceeds Application Period with respect to all or a part of the available Net Proceeds in advance of being required to
do so by the Indenture (the “Advance Offer”).

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Proceeds of
any Asset Sale are received or deemed to be received by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is
(x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any
agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the
United States, the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this
covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the
applicable local law or regulation, applicable organizational documents or other impediments will not permit
repatriation to the United States (the Co-Issuers hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the CoIssuers’ reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to within one year
following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions
reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational documents or other impediments to permit
such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have
been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law,
applicable organizational document or other impediments, such repatriation will be promptly effected and the amount
of such repatriated Net Proceeds will be promptly (and in any event not later than five Business Days after such
repatriation could be made) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether
or not repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Co-Issuers have
determined in good faith that repatriation of, or an obligation to repatriate, any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Foreign
Disposition could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of
doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment out of such Net Proceeds whereby doing so the Issuer, any of
its Subsidiaries, any Parent Entity or any of their respective Affiliates and/or direct or indirect equity owners would
incur a material Tax liability, including receipt of a material Tax dividend or a withholding Tax) taking into account
any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation, the Net Proceeds so affected
may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a
consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of
Default.

The Co-Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer by transmitting electronically in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC or by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to
the Trustee. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if
applicable, other Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the
case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (the “Declined Proceeds”), the Co-Issuers may include any remaining

284


-----

Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) as Declined Proceeds, and use such
Declined Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value,
as applicable) of Notes or other Indebtedness surrendered in an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee shall select the Notes (subject to
applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and the Co-Issuers or the representative of such other Indebtedness
shall select such other Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or
principal amount of the Notes and such other Indebtedness tendered, with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes
or other Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in an unauthorized denomination; provided that no
Notes of $250,000 or less shall be repurchased in part. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero, and in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of Net Proceeds the Co-Issuers
is offering to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Co-Issuers or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving
credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Co-Issuers
or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may elect to invest in the Issuer and its Subsidiaries prior to receiving
the Net Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Sale (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than
execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Sale) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant
to and in accordance with clause (2) above with respect to such Asset Sale.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Co-Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to
have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Co-Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes.

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities limit, and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating
to Indebtedness to which a Co-Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may prohibit or limit, such Co-Issuer
from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In the event the Co-Issuers are contractually
prohibited from purchasing the Notes, a Co-Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, may seek the consent
of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition or
limitation. If such Co-Issuer or one of its Affiliates, as the case may be, does not obtain such consent or repay such
borrowings, such Co-Issuer will remain contractually prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the CoIssuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt,
the consummation of the Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Chewy Distribution) shall not be
prohibited by the covenants below under “—Certain Covenants.”

**_Suspension of Covenants When Notes Are Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the Issue Date:

(a) an Investment Grade Rating Event has occurred; and

(b) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, the occurrence of the events
described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant
_Suspension Event,” then beginning on such day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined_
below), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the
Indenture summarized under the following headings (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

285


-----

          - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,”

          - “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock,”

          - the provisions of clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation,
Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets,”

          - “—Transactions with Affiliates,”

          - “—Future Guarantors,”

          - “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” and

          - “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event (the date of such occurrence, the “Suspension Date”),
the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be set at zero. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not
subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date
(the “Reversion Date”) any of the Rating Agencies withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating
assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating following which the Notes do not have an Investment Grade
Rating from at least two Rating Agencies, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject
to the Suspended Covenants with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the
Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” Notwithstanding that the Suspended
Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date with respect to the Notes, (1) no Default, Event of Default or
breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist or have occurred under the Notes, the related Guarantees or the Indenture
relating to the Notes with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall
bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any
time pursuant to any contractual obligation entered into or arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a
result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the
Suspension Period or after that time, as a result of any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension
Period) and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without
causing a Default or Event of Default under the Notes, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual
commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby (including any Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) and such compliance and
performance and such consummation of transactions shall be deemed to have occurred during the Suspension Period.

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock issued, during the Suspension Period
(or deemed incurred or issued during the Suspension Period in connection with a Specified Transaction entered into
during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second
paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”
On the Reversion Date, all Liens created, incurred or assumed during the Suspension Period (or deemed, created,
incurred or assumed during the Suspension Period in connection with a Specified Transaction (including with respect
to a Specified Transaction entered during the Suspension Period)) in compliance with the Indenture will be deemed
to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that they are classified as permitted under clause (7) of the definition
of “Permitted Liens.” Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted
Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with
respect to a Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period). Accordingly, Restricted Payments made
during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first
paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be
reset at zero. No Subsidiaries shall be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period, unless
such designation would have complied with the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” as if such covenant was in effect for the purposes of designating Unrestricted Subsidiaries from the Issue
Date to the date of such designation. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reversion Date pursuant

286


-----

to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates.” Any encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses
(1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be
permitted pursuant to clause (a) of such covenant. No Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the
covenant described under “—Future Guarantors” on or after the Reversion Date with respect to any guarantee entered
into by such Subsidiary during the Suspension Period. All Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed
made in connection with a Specified Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have
been made pursuant to clause (5) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens
permitted under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens). To the extent such covenant
and any Permitted Liens refer to one or more Suspended Covenants, such covenant or definition shall be interpreted
as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely
for purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other covenant).

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge
of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or
of the occurrence of a Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

if a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investments in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether pursuant
to this covenant or pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Investments,” and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the
definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants set forth in the Indenture.

-----

If the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such
Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the provisions of the
Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture
notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Issuer’s financial statements affecting
Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for any period.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any AHYDO Payment with respect
to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be
incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment
or Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (25) above or is entitled to be made
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of
“Permitted Investments,” the Issuer will be entitled to classify or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on
the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) among such clauses (1)
through (25) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” in a manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

any such other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, as applicable, will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock for purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in
reliance upon a percentage of LTM EBITDA or the Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio or Consolidated Secured Debt
Ratio in each case under clause (1) of the second preceding paragraph is being refinanced under clause (1) of the
second preceding paragraph and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified

302


-----

Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted
thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been
incurred, and permitted to be incurred, under such clause (1) so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence. Any Refinancing
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and any Indebtedness incurred to Refinance Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (4) and (12) above shall be permitted to include
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay premiums (including tender premiums),
defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, dividends and fees, costs and expenses
(including upfront fees, original issue discount or similar fees) in connection with such Refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness or
liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated
by the Issuer based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock was deemed to be incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving
credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is incurred to Refinance other
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency, and such Refinancing would
cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such Refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have
been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness or the liquidation
preference of such Disqualified Stock or such Preferred Stock being Refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest,
dividends and fees, costs and expenses (including upfront fees, original issue discount or similar fees) incurred in
connection with such Refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the
exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of any
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,
if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being Refinanced,
shall be calculated by the Issuer based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
Refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness
merely because it is unsecured or (2) Senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Senior Indebtedness
merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by sufficient collateral
or issued or guaranteed by other obligors.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Co-Issuers will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur or assume
any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, an “Initial Lien”) that secures obligations under any Indebtedness, on any
asset or property of a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor unless the Notes (or the related Guarantee in the case of Liens on
assets of a Guarantor) are equally and ratably secured with (or, in the event the Lien relates to Subordinated
Indebtedness, are secured on a senior basis to) the obligations so secured.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall provide by its terms
that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of
the Initial Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes and the Guarantees. In addition, in the event that an
Initial Lien is or becomes a Permitted Lien, the Issuer may, at its option and without consent from any Holder, elect
to release and discharge any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph in respect
of such Initial Lien.

303


-----

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original
issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_**

Neither of the Co-Issuers will consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, consummate a
Division as the Dividing Person (whether or not such Co-Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease,
convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to any Person (other than pursuant to the
Transactions) unless:

(1) a Co-Issuer is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation,
amalgamation or merger, winding up or Division (if other than a Co-Issuer) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a Person
organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia
or any territory thereof (such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor
_Company”);_ _provided that in the case where the Successor Company is not a corporation, a co-_
obligor of the Notes is a corporation;

(2) the Successor Company, if other than a Co-Issuer, expressly assumes all the obligations of a CoIssuer under the Indenture and the Notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents
or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing transactions,
as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the Applicable Measurement Period,

(a) the Successor Company (if other than the Issuer) or the Issuer would be permitted to incur
at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio test or (y) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio test, in each case, set forth in the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” or

(b) either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or (y) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, in
each case, for the Applicable Measurement Period immediately after such transaction
would be equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or equal to or less than
the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, of the Issuer for the Applicable
Measurement Period immediately prior to such transaction; and

(5) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each stating that such consolidation, amalgamation, winding up, Division, merger or transfer and
such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Issuer or the Finance Issuer, as the case
may be, under the Indenture and the Notes, and the Issuer or the Finance Issuer, as the case may be, will automatically
be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing
clauses (3) and (4),

304


-----

(1) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or amalgamate with, merge into, wind up into or
consummate a Division as the Dividing Person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise
dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(2) the Issuer may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into, wind up into, or consummate a
Division as the Dividing Person with an Affiliate of the Issuer solely for the purpose of
reincorporating the Issuer in any state of the United States, the District of Columbia or any territory
thereof.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the sale,
disposition or transfer of a Guarantor, no Guarantor will, and the Co-Issuers will not permit any such Guarantor to,
consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, consummate a Division as the Dividing Person
(whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person (other than
pursuant to the Transactions) unless:

(1) (a) such Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation, amalgamation, winding up, Division or merger (if other than such
Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition will have been made is a Person organized or existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or the laws the United States, any state
thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof (such Guarantor or such Person,
as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Person”);

(b) the Successor Person, if other than such Guarantor, expressly assumes all the obligations
of such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s related Guarantee pursuant to
supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments in form reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee; and

(c) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture; or

(2) the transaction is not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Asset Sales.”

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person will succeed to, and be
substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee, and such Guarantor will
automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and, in each of the following cases, without regard to the requirements set forth in the
preceding paragraph, any Guarantor may (i) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into, wind up into or
consummate a Division as the Dividing Person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
part of its properties and assets to another Guarantor or the Issuer, (ii) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into,
wind up into or consummate a Division as the Dividing Person with or into the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer
solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Guarantor in the United States, any state thereof, the
District of Columbia or any territory thereof, (iii) convert into a Person organized or existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of such Guarantor, the United States or any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof,
(iv) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose all or substantially all of its assets comprising Equity
Interests of Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors to the Issuer or one or more Restricted Subsidiaries or (v) liquidate or
dissolve or change its legal form if the Board of Directors or the senior management of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity
of the Issuer) determines in good faith that such action is in the best interests of the Issuer and is not materially
disadvantageous to the Holders.

Notwithstanding anything in this “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially
All Assets” covenant, the Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Chewy Distribution and the

305


-----

conversion of the Issuer to a limited liability company, including by merger into a newly-formed limited liability
company) will be permitted under the Indenture.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or
enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with any
Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or
consideration in excess of the greater of (x) $130.0 million and (y) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA, unless:

(1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms, taken as a whole, that are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an
arm’s-length basis or, if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no comparable transaction is
available with which to compare such Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate Transaction is otherwise
fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view and when such
transaction is taken in its entirety; and

(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related
Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the greater of
(x) $190.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, a resolution adopted by the majority of the
Board of Directors of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity of the Issuer) approving such Affiliate
Transaction and set forth in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction
complies with clause (1) above.

Restricted Subsidiaries or, in any case, any entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result

Parent Entity; _provided_ that such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material
assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise in compliance with the
terms of the Indenture;

monitoring agreement (or any amendment thereto or replacement thereof so long as any such
amendment or replacement is not materially disadvantageous, in the good faith judgment of the

whole, as compared to the management and monitoring agreement as in effect immediately prior to
such amendment or replacement), (b) the payment of indemnification and other similar amounts to
the Investors and reimbursement of expenses of the Investors, each case approved by, or pursuant
to arrangements approved by, the Board of Directors of the Issuer; and (c) payments by the Issuer

Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the
Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, the subordination of (including the application

providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except if such Indebtedness is by its express terms
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially
to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; provided that this covenant shall not be applicable
(i) to any guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary
and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii)
in the event that the Guarantee of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes or the Indenture by such Restricted
Subsidiary would not be permitted under applicable law.

The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause or allow, as the case may be, any Subsidiary or any of its
Parent Entities that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case, such Subsidiary
or Parent Entity shall not be required to comply with the 60-day period described above and such Guarantee may be
released at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion so long as any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary then outstanding
could have been incurred by such Subsidiary (either (x) when so incurred or (y) at the time of the release of such
Guarantee) assuming such Subsidiary were not a Guarantor at such time.

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer shall furnish:

(a) (1) within 120 days of the end of each fiscal year (or (x) if such day is not a Business Day, on the
next succeeding Business Day and (y) in the case of the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date,
150 days after the end of such fiscal year), annual audited financial statements for such fiscal year
and (2) within 60 days of the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of every fiscal year (or (x)
if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day and (y) in the case of the
first three fiscal quarters ending after the Issue Date, within 75 days of such fiscal quarters),
unaudited financial statements for the interim period as of, and for the period ending on, the end of
such fiscal quarter, in each case, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” disclosures with respect to the periods presented and, with
respect to the annual information only, a report on the annual financial statements by the Issuer’s
certified independent accountants (all of the foregoing financial information to be prepared on a

311


-----

basis reasonably consistent with and subject to exceptions reasonably consistent with, the
corresponding financial information included or incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum); and

(b) promptly after the occurrence of any of the following events, all current reports that would be
required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K as in effect on the Issue Date (if the Issuer had been
a reporting company under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act):

(1) the entry into or termination of material agreements with respect to Indebtedness only;

(2) significant acquisitions or dispositions (which shall only be with respect to acquisitions or
dispositions that are significant pursuant to the definition of “Significant Subsidiary”);

(3) bankruptcy;

(4) cross-default under direct material financial obligations;

(5) a change in the Issuer’s certifying independent auditor;

(6) the appointment or departure of directors or executive officers (with respect to the principal
executive officer, president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and
principal operating officer only);

(7) non-reliance on previously issued financial statements; and

(8) change of control transactions,

_provided, however, that the foregoing shall not obligate the Issuer (1) to provide separate financial statements or other_
information contemplated by Rules 3-03(e), 3-05, 3-09, 3-10, 3-16, 4-08, 13-01 or 13-02 of Regulation S-X or any
schedules required by Regulation S-X, (2) to comply with Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10, Item 302
or Item 402 of Regulation S-K, (3) to provide any information the Issuer determines in its good faith judgment is not
material to the Holders or the business, assets, operations or financial position of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or disclose any trade secrets, privileged or confidential information obtained from
another Person and competitively sensitive information (4) to include as an exhibit copies of any agreements, financial
statements or other items that would be required to be filed, except for agreements evidencing material Indebtedness,
(5) to provide any segment reporting and disclosure (including any required by FASB Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 280), (6) to include XBRL exhibits, (7) to provide earnings per share information or (8) to provide
information regarding executive compensation and related party disclosure related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A,
34-54302A and IC-27444A.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be required to (i) comply with Sections 302,
906 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or (ii) otherwise furnish any information, certificates or
reports required by Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K.

The Issuer will (1) distribute such reports and information electronically to the Trustee and (2) make available
such reports and information to any Holder, any bona fide prospective purchaser of the Notes (a “Prospective
_Purchaser”), any bona fide security analyst or any bona fide market maker by posting such reports and information_
on Intralinks or any comparable password protected online data system or on a public website (the “Noteholder
_Website”);_ _provided_ that the Issuer shall only be required to make readily available any password or other login
information to any such Holder, Prospective Purchaser, security analyst or market maker; provided, further, that such
Holders, Prospective Purchasers, security analysts and market makers shall agree to (i) treat all such reports (and the
information contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained
therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose
any such reports (and the information contained therein) and information. Notwithstanding any other provision in the
Indenture, the Issuer may deny access to the Noteholder Website or deny access to any competitively-sensitive

312


-----

information and reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this covenant to any such Holder, Prospective Purchaser,
security analyst or market maker that is or may become a competitor of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to the extent
that the Issuer determines in good faith that such access or the provision of such information and reports to such Person
would be competitively harmful to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries.

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also:

(1) as promptly as reasonably practicable after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and quarterly report
required by clauses (a)(1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this “—Reports and Other Information”
covenant or such earlier time after the completion of such reporting period, hold a conference call
to discuss the results of operations for the relevant reporting period; and

(2) prior to the date of the conference call required to be held in accordance with clause (1) of this
paragraph, announce on the Noteholder Website the time and date of such conference call and either
include all information necessary to access the call or inform Holders, Prospective Purchasers,
securities analysts and market makers how they can obtain such information.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to prospective investors, upon
their request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so
long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

If the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Unrestricted
Subsidiaries if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual
and quarterly information required by clause (a) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements, in the footnotes thereto or in an “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations
of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

Any Parent Entity may satisfy the obligations of the Issuer set forth in this “—Reports and Other Information”
covenant by providing the requisite financial and other information of such Parent Entity instead of the Issuer;
_provided that if such Parent Entity is not a Guarantor, to the extent such Parent Entity holds assets (other than its direct_
or indirect interest in the Issuer) that exceeds the lesser of (i) 1.0% of Total Assets of such Parent Entity and (ii) 1.0%
of the total revenue for the preceding fiscal year of such Parent Entity, then such information related to such Parent
Entity shall be accompanied by consolidating information, which may be posted to the website of the Issuer (or any
Parent Entity) or on a non-public, password-protected website or online data system maintained by the Issuer (or any
Parent Entity) or a third party, that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information of such Parent
Entity, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the
other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the preceding
sentence need not be audited or reviewed by the auditors.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the reports referred to clauses (a) and (b) of the first paragraph
of this covenant if the Issuer or any Parent Entity has filed reports containing such information (or any such
information of a Parent Entity in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph) with the SEC through
EDGAR.

The Trustee shall have no responsibility to determine if such reports and information have been filed with
the SEC. Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and its
receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable from information contained therein, including our compliance with any of our covenants under the
indenture or the notes (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers’ Certificates). The Trustee
shall not be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise, our compliance with the covenants
or with respect to any reports or other documents filed with the SEC on EDGAR or any website under the Indenture,
or participate in any conference calls.

313


-----

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer will not be deemed to have failed to comply with
any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” until 180 days
after the date any report hereunder is due.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this “—Reports and Other
Information” covenant and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal
of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes;

(3) failure by a Co-Issuer, any Guarantor or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor for 60 days after
receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of its obligations,
covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1) or (2) above) contained in
the Indenture or the Notes or, in the case of the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor, contained in the
Chewy Stock Guarantee Agreement; provided that no such notice may be given with respect to any
action taken, and reported publicly or to the Holders, more than two years prior to such notice;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there
is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by a Co-Issuer, any Guarantor or the
Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor or the payment of which is guaranteed by a Co-Issuer, any
Guarantor or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the
issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its
stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an
obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated
final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such
Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving
effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
in the aggregate equal to the greater of (x) $420.0 million (or its foreign currency
equivalent) and (y) 33.0% of LTM EBITDA of the Issuer for the Applicable Measurement
Period or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) failure by a Co-Issuer, the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary to pay
final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of (x) $420.0 million (or its foreign currency
equivalent) and (y) 33.0% of LTM EBITDA (net of amounts covered by insurance as to which the
insurer has been notified of such judgment or order and has not denied its obligation), which final,
non-appealable judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60
days after such judgment becomes final and non-appealable, and in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such
judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

314


-----

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to a Co-Issuer, any Significant Subsidiary,
or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor; and

(7) the Guarantee of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or the Affiliate Guarantee of the
Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect (except as
contemplated by the terms thereof or by the Indenture) or be declared null and void or any
responsible officer of any such Guarantor denies that it has any further liability under its Guarantee
or gives notice to such effect, other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all obligations under
the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance
with the Indenture.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above with respect to the Issuer) occurs
and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other
monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture to be due and payable immediately.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this
section with respect to the Issuer, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice.
The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event
of Default, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest. Any time period to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event
of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes issued thereunder by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive
any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default or
Event of Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any such Note held by a nonconsenting Holder) and rescind any acceleration and its consequences with respect to the Notes, provided that such
rescission would not conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any Event of
Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting
payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded,
automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default
arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged;

(2) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be)
giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any
of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have
offered, and, if requested, provided, to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or
expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder
of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the
Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

315


-----

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer
of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes.
The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in
personal liability.

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default,
notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (other
than a Regulated Bank) (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such
Holder delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its
nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position
_Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of_
Default (a “Default Direction”) shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or
otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of
providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may
reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within
five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its
nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial
owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position
Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has
initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such
time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Default or Event of Default that resulted
from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be
automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically
reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes,
the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its
Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically stayed
and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder
Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification
Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder
Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the
remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such
Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default
shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received
such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding
shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction
delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any
Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s

316


-----

Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative
Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall
have no liability or responsibility to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in connection with any Noteholder
Direction or to determine whether or not any Holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position
Representation conforms with the Indenture or any other agreement.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding
compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days, upon becoming aware of any
Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default and the
proposed action by the Issuer.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder, member or
limited partner of the Issuer or any Guarantor (or the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor) or any of their parent
companies shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors or the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor under the Notes, the Guarantees, the Affiliate Guarantee or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against
public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Co-Issuers, the Guarantors and the Chewy Stock Affiliate Guarantor under the
Indenture, the Notes and the Affiliate Guarantee will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released
upon payment in full of all of the Notes issued under the Indenture. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect
to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the Notes issued under the Indenture and have each Co-Issuer’s
and each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee of the Notes and the Chewy Stock Affiliate
Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Affiliate Guarantee of the Notes (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure
all then existing Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Co-Issuers’ obligations with respect to Notes issued under the Indenture concerning issuing
temporary Notes, registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in
connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Co-Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the Indenture
(“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default
or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including
bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under “—Events of
Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

317


-----

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes issued under
the Indenture:

(1) the Co-Issuers must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders,
cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be
sufficient (without consideration of reinvestment of interest), in the opinion of an Independent
Financial Advisor, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on the Notes issued
under the Indenture on the stated maturity date or on the redemption date, as the case may be, of
such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes and the Issuer must specify whether such
Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; provided that upon any
redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be
sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee
equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any
deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only
required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously
with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium
Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Co-Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel from counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that,
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, (i) the Co-Issuers have received from, or there
has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service, a ruling or (ii) since the Issue
Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the
effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Co-Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion
of Counsel from counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that,
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of such Covenant Defeasance
and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other material agreement
or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which, a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by
which a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting from any borrowing of funds
to be applied to make such deposit required to effect such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance
and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the
granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(5) the Co-Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit
was not made by the Co-Issuers with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any
creditors of a Co-Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and

(6) the Co-Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
(which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

318


-----

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to the Notes issued thereunder,
when either:

(1) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed Notes
which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due
and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer and a Co-Issuer or any
Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust
funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, Government
Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient (without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest) to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness
on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal,
premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption, as the case may
be; _provided_ that, upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the
extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit
only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the
Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms
that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(b) the Co-Issuers have paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture;
and

(c) the Co-Issuers have delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the Redemption Date, as the case
may be.

In addition, the Co-Issuers must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee
stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been complied with.

Further, if the Indenture is discharged in accordance with the above, the Affiliate Guarantee will be
automatically released and discharged.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes issued thereunder and
any related Guarantee, and the Affiliate Guarantee, may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a
creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect
of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if
it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes issued thereunder will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case
an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured) for which a responsible officer of the Trustee has actual
knowledge, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in
the conduct of such person’s own affairs.

Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder shall have offered, and, if requested, provided to
the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

**Foreign Currency Equivalents**

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction or amount (other than
the incurrence of Indebtedness), the U.S. dollar equivalent amount of any amount denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such transaction was entered
into. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture, no restriction or amount will be exceeded or deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees and the Affiliate Guarantee will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

**Specified Transactions**

When calculating the availability under any basket, ratio or any financial metric under the Indenture or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture, in each case in connection with (a) any Limited Condition
Acquisition, (b) any repayment, redemption or repurchase of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock with
respect to which a notice of repayment or redemption (or similar notice), which may be conditional, has been delivered,
(c) any dividends or distributions on, or redemptions of equity, in each case requiring declaration in advance thereof,
(d) the making of any Asset Sale or any disposition excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale,” or (e) any other
transaction or plan undertaken or proposed to be undertaken in connection with such Limited Condition Acquisition
or any transaction set forth in clauses (b) through (d) (the transactions referred to in clauses (a) through (e),
collectively, the “Specified Transactions,” and each, a “Specified Transaction”) and any actions or transactions related
thereto, the date of determination of such basket, ratio or financial metric or whether any such Specified Transaction
is permitted (or any requirement or conditions therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of
any Default or Event of Default)) may, at the option of the Issuer, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, a Parent Entity
of the Issuer, any successor entity of any of the foregoing (including a third party) (the “Testing Party”) (which election
may be made on or prior to the date of consummation of such Specified Transaction), be the date the definitive
agreements for such Specified Transaction are entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of a binding offer,
launch of a “certain funds” tender offer), the date of declaration of such Restricted Payment, the date of the public
announcement of such Specified Transaction, or the date such notice, which may be conditional, of such repayment
or redemption in connection with a repayment, redemption or repurchase of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is given to the Holders of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (any such date,
the “Transaction Test Date”) and such baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall be calculated with such pro forma
adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definitions of
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio and Consolidated

322


-----

Secured Debt Ratio after giving effect to such Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto
(including any incurrence of Liens, Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if it occurred at the beginning of
the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Specified Transaction, and, for
the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets, ratios or financial metrics are exceeded or otherwise have failed to
be complied with as a result of fluctuations in such basket, ratio or related financial metrics (including, but not limited
to, due to fluctuations in Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer, the target company or the
Person that is otherwise the subject of the Specified Transaction for the Applicable Measurement Period) subsequent
to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Specified Transaction and any actions
or transactions related thereto, such baskets, ratios or financial metrics will not be deemed to have been exceeded as
a result of such fluctuations and (y) such baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto except as contemplated
in clause (a) of the immediately succeeding proviso; provided, however, that (a) if financial statements for one or more
subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available subsequent to the date of determination, the Testing Party may
elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such baskets, ratios and financial metrics on the basis of such financial
statements, in which case such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable Transaction
Test Date for purposes of such baskets, ratios and financial metrics, (b) if any ratios or financial metrics improve or
baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios, financial metrics or baskets may be utilized, (c)
if the Testing Party elects to have such determinations occur at the Transaction Test Date, any such transactions
(including the Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto) shall be deemed to have occurred
on the Transaction Test Date and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets, ratios or financial
metrics under the Indenture after the Transaction Test Date and before the consummation of such Specified
Transaction unless and until such Specified Transaction has been abandoned, as determined by the Testing Party, prior
to the consummation thereof and (d) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
will be calculated using an assumed interest rate based on the indicative interest margin, as reasonably determined by
the Testing Party in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has exercised its option pursuant to
the foregoing and any Default or Event of Default occurs following the Transaction Test Date (including any new
Transaction Test Date) for the applicable Specified Transaction and prior to or on the date of the consummation of
such Specified Transaction, any such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred or be
continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Specified Transaction
is permitted under the Indenture.

**Certain Compliance Determinations**

The Indenture shall provide that any calculations or measure that is determined with reference to the Issuer’s
financial statements (including, without limitation, Applicable Measurement Period, Consolidated Interest Expense,
Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total
Debt Ratio, Consolidated EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Fixed Charges, Permitted Receivables Financing,
Total Assets and clause (3)(a) of the first paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
Payments”) may be determined with reference to the financial statements of a Parent Entity of the Issuer instead, so
long as such Parent Entity is, as of the Applicable Calculation Date, providing the requisite financial and other
information under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information” in accordance with the seventh paragraph
under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information.”

Permitted Receivables Financing and Total Assets) under the Indenture, the U.S. dollar equivalent amount of any
amount denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated, to the extent not already reflected in U.S. dollars in the
relevant financial statements (which may be internal), based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect as of the
end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the
Applicable Calculation Date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken
in reliance on a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio,

323


-----

Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, such ratio(s) shall be calculated with respect to
such incurrence, issuance or other transaction without giving effect to amounts being utilized under any other basket
(other than a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio) on the same
date (whether such baskets are utilized in a single transaction, a series of related transactions or otherwise). Each item
of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that is incurred or issued, each Lien incurred and each other
transaction undertaken will be deemed to have been incurred, issued or taken first, to the extent available, pursuant to
the relevant Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio test.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in connection with a Testing Party’s election to use a Transaction
Test Date in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction, any reference to “date of
incurrence” or “time of incurrence” or other similar phrases with respect to the date or time an action is taken herein
will mean the Transaction Test Date.

Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” the Issuer may

election of an Elected Amount and (iii) for subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Elected

acquisition, disposition, Division, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation or operational change
that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such Applicable Measurement Period as if such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, Division, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation or operational changes had
occurred at the beginning of the Applicable Measurement Period. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a
Subsidiary was previously designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary but was redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary
during or subsequent to the Applicable Measurement Period and is a Restricted Subsidiary as of the Applicable
Calculation Date, the computation referred to above shall be calculated on a _pro forma_ basis assuming that such
redesignation as a Restricted Subsidiary (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and any change in
Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the Applicable Measurement Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever _pro forma_ effect is to be given to a transaction, the _pro forma_
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (and may include,

Transactions, and such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies, collectively “Specified
_Adjustments”), in each case calculated in accordance with and permitted by clause (b) of the definition of_
“Consolidated EBITDA,” which is being given _pro forma_ effect that have been or are expected to be realized);
_provided, that the Specified Adjustments made pursuant to this paragraph are reasonably anticipated to result from_
actions taken or to be taken (in the good faith determination of the Issuer) within 24 months after the consummation
of any transaction or change that is expected to result in such Specified Adjustment. If any Indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if

months or longer, and in the case of any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness with a remaining term

paragraph of this definition, interest on any Indebtedness under revolving credit facilities computed on a pro forma
basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period or, if

on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a

shall be irrevocable; provided, further, any calculation or determination in the Indenture that requires the application
of GAAP for periods that include fiscal quarters ended prior to the Issuer’s election to apply IFRS shall remain as
previously calculated or determined in accordance with GAAP. The Issuer shall give notice of any such election made
in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, solely making an election (without any
other action) referred to in this definition will not be treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness. If there occurs a change
in IFRS or GAAP, as the case may be, and such change would cause a change in the method of calculation of any

to the notes and pursuant to Regulation S as provided in the indentures that will govern the notes. Beneficial interests
in the Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes at any
time except in the limited circumstances described under “—Exchanges Between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A
Notes” below.

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another
nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be
exchanged for definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) except in the limited
circumstances described below. See “—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes” below. Except in the limited
circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive
physical delivery of notes in certificated form.

Rule 144A Notes (including beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes) will be subject to certain
restrictions on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” Regulation S
Notes will also be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will also bear a restrictive legend as described under
“Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the
applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg), which may change from time to time.

**Depository Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the
respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and
procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of
New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a

372


-----

“clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold
securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in
accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers or
affiliates thereof), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s
system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect
Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only
through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests
in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

- upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated by the initial
purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

- ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these
interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by
the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global
Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through
DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly
through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg) that are Participants. Investors in the
Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg
if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration
of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through
Participants in DTC other than Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities
accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which in turn hold such interests in
customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Citibank, N.A. acts as depositary for
Clearstream, Luxembourg, and Euroclear S.A./N.V. acts as depositary for Euroclear. All interests in a Global Note,
including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, may be subject to the procedures and
requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg may also be subject to the
procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical
delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a
Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which
in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to
pledge such interests to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.

**Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names,**
**will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners**
**or “holders” thereof under the indentures that will govern the notes for any purpose.**

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Global Note registered in the
name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture. Under
the terms of the indenture, we and the trustee thereunder will treat the persons in whose names the notes, including
the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes. Consequently, neither we nor any agent of ours or either trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability
for:

- any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to, or payments
made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or

373


-----

reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial
ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

- any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the
notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the
payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant
Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount
of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to
the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the
responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be our responsibility or the responsibility of
DTC or either trustee. Neither we nor the trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the
Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and we and the trustee may conclusively rely
on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between the Participants
will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between
participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg participants, on the
other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg, as the case may be, by its respective depositary. However, such cross-market transactions will require
delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such
system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such
system. Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement
requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by
delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in
accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and
Clearstream, Luxembourg participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction
of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect
of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have
given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under any of the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange
the Global Notes in respect of such notes for legended notes in certificated form and to distribute such notes to its
Participants.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes among participants in DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such
procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. Neither we nor the trustee nor any of our or its agents
will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or their respective
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

374


-----

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:

- DTC (1) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes or (2) has
ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, we fail to appoint a
successor depositary; or

- there has occurred and is continuing an event of default with respect to such notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior written
notice given to the trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes
delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary
procedures) and will bear a restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required
by applicable law.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

Certificated Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the transferor first
delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes.

**Exchanges Between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes may be
exchanged for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes only if:

- such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

- the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the
effect that the notes are being transferred to a person:

(i) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A;

(ii) purchasing for its own account or the account of a QIB in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A; and

(iii) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Notes, whether before or after the expiration of the Restricted Period,
only if the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available)
and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, the interest transferred will be held
immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule
144A Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the indenture trustee through
the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate
adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Notes and a
corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes or vice versa, as applicable. Any
beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest
in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in

375


-----

the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures
applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and
practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes prior to the expiration
of the Restricted Period.

**Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes**

A holder of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes must provide Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the indenture certifying that
the beneficial owner of the interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes is either a non-U.S. person or a U.S.
person that has purchased such interest in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements under the
Securities Act and Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, must deliver to the trustee (or the
paying agent if other than such trustee) a certificate in the form required by the indenture, prior to any exchange of
such beneficial interest for a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Permanent Global Notes.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

We will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its
nominee. We will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to Certificated Notes by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if
no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. The notes represented by
the Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted
secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately
available funds. We expect that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately
available funds.

Because of time-zone differences, credits of interests in the Global Notes received in Clearstream,
Luxembourg or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC Participant will be made during subsequent securities
settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions
involving interests in such Global Notes settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Clearstream,
Luxembourg or Euroclear participants on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear
as a result of sales of interests in the Global Notes by or through a Clearstream, Luxembourg participant or a Euroclear
Participant to a DTC Participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the
relevant Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC.

376


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The issuance and sale of the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws (and we are under no obligation to so register the notes), and may not be offered, sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, any U.S. person, except pursuant
to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
other applicable securities laws. Accordingly, the notes are being offered, sold and issued only to persons reasonably
believed to be “qualified purchasers” (“Qualified Purchasers”) (as defined in Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment
Company Act and the rules thereunder) who are also (i) reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” (as
defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act, “QIBs”) in a private transaction in reliance upon an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A and any other applicable securities laws or
(ii) persons other than U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States who will be required to make certain
representations to us and others prior to the investment in the notes in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities
Act.

**_Investment Company Act_**

In reliance on Section 3(c)(7) under the Investment Company Act, one or more guarantors of the notes have
not registered as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act. To facilitate reliance by such
guarantors on Section 3(c)(7), each Issuer must have a “reasonable belief” that all purchasers of the notes (including
the initial purchasers and subsequent transferees) are Qualified Purchasers at the time of their purchase of the notes.
Each Issuer will establish a reasonable belief for purposes of Section 3(c)(7) based upon the representations deemed
made by the purchasers of the notes as set forth under “—Purchaser Representations and Warranties” and the Issuers’
covenants and undertakings referred to below.

**_Purchaser Representations and Warranties_**

Each purchaser of notes is subject to restrictions on transfer as summarized below. By purchasing notes, each
purchaser (and in the case of clause (7), each transferee of the notes) will be deemed to represent, warrant,
acknowledge and agree as follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation S under
the Securities Act are used herein as defined therein):

(1) It understands and acknowledges that neither of the Issuers nor the guarantors are registered as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act, and that certain guarantors are excluded
from treatment as an investment company and from any requirement to be registered as such by
virtue of Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.

(2) It is not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Company or the
guarantors, that the purchaser is not acting on its behalf and that it is a Qualified Purchaser and either
(A) (i) is a QIB, (ii) is acquiring the notes for its own account or for the account of a QIB and (iii)
is aware that the initial purchasers are selling the notes to it in reliance on Rule 144A or (B) is not a
U.S. person and is acquiring the notes in an offshore transaction pursuant to Regulation S.

(3) It is not a broker-dealer which owns and invests on a discretionary basis less than $25,000,000 in
securities of issuers unaffiliated with such broker-dealer.

(4) It is not a participant-directed employee plan, such as a 401(k) plan, or a trust holding the assets of
such a plan, unless the investment decisions with respect to such plan are made solely by the
fiduciary, trustee or sponsor of such plan.

(5) It understands that the notes are being offered in a transaction not involving any public offering in
the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the notes have not been and will not
be registered under the Securities Act and that (A) if in the future it decides to offer, resell, pledge
or otherwise transfer any of the notes, such notes may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise
transferred only (i) for so long as the notes are eligible for resale under Rule 144A, to a person whom

377


-----

the seller reasonably believes is a Qualified Purchaser and QIB that is purchasing for its own account
or for the account of another Qualified Purchaser and QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements
of Rule 144A, (ii) outside the United States in a transaction with a Qualified Purchaser complying
with the provisions of Rule 904 under the Securities Act, (iii) pursuant to an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to Rule 144) or (iv) to us or any of our
subsidiaries, in each case in a minimum principal amount of notes of $250,000, for investment
purposes and not with a view to or for offer or sale in connection with any distribution in violation
of the Securities Act, in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any State of the United
States, and that (B) it will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent
purchaser of the notes from it of the resale restrictions referred to in clause (A) above.
Notwithstanding the availability of an exemption from the registration requirements under the
Securities Act, the notes may not be resold or transferred except to (i) investors that are QIBs
pursuant to Rule 144A that are also Qualified Purchasers or (ii) investors that are non-U.S. persons
pursuant to Regulation S that are also Qualified Purchasers.

(6) Each purchaser also acknowledges that we and the Trustee reserve the right to require in connection
with any offer, sale or other transfer of notes the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications
and/or other information satisfactory to us and the Trustee

(7) Each purchaser and each account for which it is purchasing or otherwise acquiring the notes (or
beneficial interests therein), will purchase, hold or transfer at least $250,000 of the notes (or
beneficial interests therein), except that, if such purchaser is a professional fiduciary and is
purchasing at least an aggregate $250,000 of the Notes on behalf of multiple fiduciary accounts,
each of which is a Qualified Institutional Buyer pursuant to Rule 144A that is also a Qualified
Purchaser (as defined in Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder),
each purchaser may allocate beneficial interests in such Securities to such accounts in amounts of
not less than $1,000.

(8) Each purchaser was not formed, reformed or recapitalized for the specific purpose of investing in
the Securities and/or other securities of the Trust (unless all of the beneficial owners of such
Purchaser’s securities are both Qualified Institutional Buyers and Qualified Purchasers).

(9) If the purchaser is an investment company excepted from the Investment Company Act pursuant to
Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereof and was formed on or before April 30, 1996, it has received
the consent of its beneficial owners who acquired their interests on or before April 30,1996, with
respect to its treatment as a Qualified Purchaser in the manner required by Section 2(a)(51)(C) of
the Investment Company Act and the rules promulgated thereunder.

(10) The Purchaser is not a partnership, common trust fund or corporation, special trust, pension fund or
retirement plan, or other entity, in which the partners, beneficiaries, beneficial owners, participants,
shareholders or other equity owners, as the case may be, may designate the particular investment to
be made, or the allocation thereof, unless all such partners, beneficiaries, beneficial owners,
participants, shareholders or other equity owners are both Qualified Institutional Buyers and
Qualified Purchasers.

(11) The Purchaser has not invested more than 40% of its assets in the notes (or beneficial interests
therein) and/or other notes of the Issuers after giving effect to the purchase of the notes (or beneficial
interests therein) (unless all of the beneficial owners of such Purchaser’s securities are both
Qualified Institutional Buyers and Qualified Purchasers).

(12) The Purchaser agrees that the Issuers shall be entitled to require any holder of the Securities (or a
beneficial interest therein) that is determined not to have been both a Qualified Institutional Buyer
and a Qualified Purchaser (or to have met the other requirements set forth in paragraphs 1 through
paragraphs 11 of this “—Purchaser Representations and Warranties”) at the time of acquisition of
such Securities (or such beneficial interest) to sell such Securities (or such beneficial interest) in
accordance with the provisions described in the legend below.

378


-----

The Purchaser understands that the Trust may receive a list of participants holding positions in the
Securities from DTC or any other depositary holding beneficial interests in the Securities.

(13) It understands that the notes will, unless otherwise agreed by the issuers and the holder thereof, bear
a legend substantially to the following effect:

acquisition and holding of such note and any interest therein will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar
violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

(18) It acknowledges that the trustee under the indentures that will govern the notes will not be required
to accept for registration of transfer any notes acquired by it, except upon presentation of evidence
satisfactory to us and the trustee that the restrictions set forth herein have been complied with.

(19) It acknowledges that we, the guarantors, the initial purchasers and others will rely upon the truth
and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements and agrees that if
any of the acknowledgments, representations or agreements deemed to have been made by its
purchase of the notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify us and the initial purchasers
thereof. If it is acquiring the notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it
represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such account and it has full
power to make the foregoing acknowledgments, representations, and agreements on behalf of each
such account.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this offering memorandum, the Issuers may issue notes, directly or
through the initial purchasers, to any person reasonably believed to be a Qualified Purchaser.

**_Reminder notices_**

At least annually, the Issuer will send, or cause to be sent, to all holders of the notes a reminder notice (each, a
“Reminder Notice”). Each Reminder Notice will state that: (1) each holder of a note (or an interest in note) must be
able to make the representations set forth above in paragraph 1 under “—Purchaser Representations and Warranties”
(the “3(c)(7) Representations”), (2) the notes (or interests in the notes) are transferable only to purchasers deemed to
have made the 3(c)(7) Representations and satisfy the other transfer restrictions applicable to the notes and (3) if any
holder of the notes (or an interest in the notes) is determined not to be a Qualified Purchaser at the time of transfer to
such holder, then the transfer to such holder will be null and void and such holder will be required to transfer all of its
notes (and all interests therein) to a transferee designated by the Issuer. The Issuer will send each Reminder Notice to
DTC with a request that participants provide them to the beneficial owners of the notes.

**_DTC actions with respect to the notes_**

The Issuer will direct DTC to take the following steps in connection with any Global Securities:

(i) to include the “3c7” marker for any Global Securities in order to indicate that sales are limited to
Qualified Purchasers;

(ii) to cause each (i) physical DTC delivery order ticket delivered by DTC to purchasers of the notes to
contain the 20-character security descriptor and (ii) DTC delivery order ticket delivered by DTC to
purchasers of the notes in electronic form to contain the “3c7” indicator and the related user manual
for participants; and

(iii) to send on or prior to the initial issuance date for the notes an “Important Notice” to all DTC
participants in connection with the offering of the notes. The “Important Notice” will be in
substantially the form of an exhibit to each of the indentures governing the notes and will notify
DTC’s participants that the notes are Section 3(c)(7) securities. The Issuer may instruct DTC from

381


-----

time to time (but not more frequently than every six months) to reissue the Important Notice.

In addition, the Issuer will from time to time make a request to DTC to deliver to the Issuer a list of all DTC Participants
holding an interest in the notes.

**_Bloomberg screens, etc._**

The Issuers will from time to time request all third-party vendors to include on screens maintained by such vendors
appropriate legends regarding Rule 144A, Regulation S and Section 3(c)(7) restrictions on the Global Securities. The
data provided by such third-party vendors may not always reflect such requests and may vary over time based on
hardware and software limitations. Without limiting the foregoing, the initial purchasers will request that Bloomberg,
L.P. include the following on each Bloomberg screen containing information about the Securities, on the bottom of
the “Security Display” page describing the Global Securities: “ISS’D UNDER 144A/3c7. OR REG S/3c7 SEE OMONLY QIB/QP. OR NON-U.S./QP NON-COMPLIANT PURCHASE MAY BE VOIDED/RESULT IN FORCED
SALE.”

**_CUSIPs_**

The Issuers will cause each “CUSIP” number obtained for a Global Security to have an attached “fixed field” that
contains “3c7” and “144A” indicators, in the case of the Rule 144A notes, and “3c7” and “REG S” indicators, in the
case of the Regulation S notes.

**_Legends_**

The Issuers will not remove from any notes (including any Global Security) the legend set forth in “—Purchaser
Representations and Warranties” above at any time.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the notes as of the date of this offering memorandum. This summary deals only with
notes held as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, assets held for investment)
by investors who purchase the notes for cash pursuant to this offering at their initial “issue price” (the first price at
which a substantial amount of the notes of the applicable series is sold to investors for cash (excluding sales to bond
houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or
wholesaler)).

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes that is for United States federal income
tax purposes any of the following:

- an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes)
created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

- an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

- a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United
States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in
effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

As used herein, the term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes (other than an entity treated
as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. holder.

If any entity classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds the notes, the tax
treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the
partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the notes, you should
consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences
applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including
(but not limited to) if you are:

- a dealer in securities or currencies;

- a financial institution;

- an individual retirement or other tax deferred account;

- a regulated investment company;

- a real estate investment trust;

- a tax-exempt organization;

- an insurance company;

- a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a
straddle;

- a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;

383


-----

- a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

- a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes (or a person who is
an investor in such an entity);

- a person subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the
notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement (as defined in Section 451 of the Code);

- a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

- a U.S. holder that holds the notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries;

- a “controlled foreign corporation”;

- a “passive foreign investment company”; or

- a United States expatriate.

This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), United States
Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be
changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different
from those summarized below. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service
or an opinion from legal or tax counsel regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the Internal
Revenue Service or a court will not take a contrary position to the tax consequences discussed.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of all the United States federal income tax
consequences applicable to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare
contribution tax on net investment income, U.S. federal estate and gift tax law, or the effects of any state, local or nonUnited States tax laws. **If you are considering purchasing notes, you should consult your own tax advisors**
**concerning the particular United States federal income and estate tax consequences to you of the purchase,**
**ownership or disposition of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under any other federal tax**
**laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**Characterization of the Notes**

In certain circumstances (see e.g. See “Description of Senior First Lien Notes—Optional Redemption,”
“Description of Senior Unsecured Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of Senior First Lien Notes—Change
of Control Triggering Event” and “Description of Senior Unsecured Notes—Change of Control Triggering Event”),
we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated principal on the notes. Our obligation to pay such excess
amounts may implicate the provisions of the Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments,”
in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different
from the consequences discussed herein. Under these Treasury regulations, however, one or more contingencies will
not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument if, as of the issue date, such
contingencies in the aggregate are considered “remote” or “incidental.” Although the matter is not free from doubt,
we believe and intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should be treated as remote and/or
incidental, in the aggregate, within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, and thus
do not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations.
Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS on its tax return for
the year during which it acquires the notes that it is taking a different position. However, this determination is not
binding on, and may be challenged by, the IRS. A successful challenge of this position by the IRS could affect the
timing and amount of a holder’s income and could cause the gain from the sale or other disposition of a note to be
treated as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, and a holder might be required to accrue income on the notes
based upon a “comparable yield” (as defined in the Treasury regulations) in excess of stated interest. This disclosure
assumes that the notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments. Holders are urged to consult their

384


-----

own tax advisors regarding the potential application to the notes of the contingent payment debt instrument Treasury
regulations and the consequences thereof.

**U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to U.S.
holders of the notes.

**_Stated Interest_**

Stated interest on the notes will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is received or
accrued, depending on your regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. It is expected,
and this discussion assumes, that the notes will be issued without original issue discount for United States federal
income tax purposes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note, you generally will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the disposition (which does not include
an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed above)
and the adjusted tax basis of the note. Your adjusted tax basis in a note will, in general, be your cost for that note. Any
gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals)
derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to nonU.S. holders of the notes.

**_United States Federal Withholding Tax_**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and “FATCA” below, United States federal withholding
tax will not apply to any payment of interest on the notes under the “portfolio interest rule,” provided that:

- interest paid on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States;

- you do not actually (or constructively) own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of
voting stock of the regarded parent entity of any Issuer, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, within the
meaning of the Code and applicable United States Treasury regulations;

- you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to the Issuers through stock ownership;

- you are not a bank that is receiving the interest on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement
entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and

- either (a) you provide your name and address on an applicable Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Form W-8,
and certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code or
(b) you hold your notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the certification requirements of
applicable United States Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply to non-U.S. holders that are
pass-through entities rather than corporations or individuals.

385


-----

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject to
a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly
executed:

- IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form) certifying an exemption from or reduction in
withholding under an applicable income tax treaty; or

- IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the notes is not subject to
withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States (as discussed below under “—United States Federal Income Tax”).

**_United States Federal Income Tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is effectively connected
with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a
United States permanent establishment or fixed base), then you will be subject to United States federal income tax on
that interest on a net income basis (although you will be exempt from the 30% United States federal withholding tax,
provided the certification requirements discussed above in “—United States Federal Withholding Tax” are satisfied)
in generally the same manner as if you were a United States person as defined under the Code. In addition, if you are
a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty
rate) of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to certain adjustments.

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and “FATCA” below, any gain realized on the sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note generally will not be subject to United States
federal income tax unless:

- the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required
by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base),
in which case you will be subject to United States federal income tax on such gain in the same manner as
described above with respect to effectively connected interest; or

- you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that
disposition, and certain other conditions are met, in which case you will be subject to United States federal
income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on such gain (net of certain
United States source losses).

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_U.S. Holders_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest on the notes and the
proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a note paid to you (unless
you are an exempt recipient). Backup withholding may apply to such payments (currently at a rate of 24%), unless the
holder (i) is an entity that is exempt from backup withholding (generally including corporations, tax-exempt
organizations and certain qualified nominees) and, when required, provides appropriate documentation to that effect
or (ii) provides the applicable withholding agent with its social security or other taxpayer identification number
(“TIN”) within a reasonable time after a request therefor, certifies that the TIN provided is correct and that the holder
has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding due to a prior underreporting of interest or
dividends, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A U.S. holder who
does not provide the applicable withholding agent with its correct TIN may be subject to penalties imposed by the
IRS.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability, provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

386


-----

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Interest paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments generally will be
reported to the IRS. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments and any withholding may also
be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside under the provisions of an applicable income
tax treaty. In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest on the notes
that we make to you provided that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know
that you are a United States person as defined under the Code, and such withholding agent has received from you the
required certification that you are a non-U.S. holder described above in the fifth bullet point under “—Non-U.S.
Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%)
will apply to the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of notes within the United States or conducted through certain
United States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to the payor under penalties of perjury that you are a
non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person
as defined under the Code), or you otherwise establish an exemption.

The proceeds of a disposition (including a retirement or redemption) effected outside the United States by a
non-U.S. holder of the notes to or through a foreign office of a broker generally will not be subject to backup
withholding or related information reporting. However, if that broker has certain types of relationships with the United
States described in Treasury regulations, such information reporting requirements will apply (but backup withholding
generally will not apply) unless that broker has documentary evidence in its files of such holder’s status as a non-U.S.
holder.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability, provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**FATCA**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as “FATCA”), may impose a
30% United States federal withholding tax on any interest income paid on the notes to (i) a “foreign financial
institution” (as specifically defined in the Code), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S.
government to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders
of such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account
holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) and to withhold certain amounts, or (ii) a foreign entity that is not
a financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such entity
provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial U.S. owners of the entity, which
generally includes any U.S. person who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity. If an interest payment
is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under “—Non-U.S.
Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax,” the withholding under FATCA may be credited against, and
therefore reduce, such other withholding tax.

An intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and the applicable foreign country, or future Treasury
regulations or other guidance, may modify these requirements. In many cases, non-U.S. holders may be able to indicate
their exemption from, or compliance with, FATCA by providing a properly completed Form W-8BEN or W-8BENE to the applicable withholding agent certifying as to such status under FATCA; however, it is possible that additional
information and diligence requirements will apply in order for a holder to establish an exemption from withholding
under FATCA to the applicable withholding agent. Investors are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors
regarding the implications of FATCA with respect to their investment in our notes. You should consult your own tax
advisor regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant to your ownership and disposition of the notes.

FATCA withholding rules were previously scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2019, that would have
applied to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of property of a type that can produce U.S.
source interest or dividends. However, such withholding has effectively been suspended under proposed Treasury
regulations that may be relied on until final regulations become effective. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that

387


-----

a similar rule will not go into effect in the future. Each non-U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding
the possible impact of FATCA withholding rules on such non-U.S. holder.

388

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the notes
by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or provisions under any other federal, state,
local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of the Code or ERISA (collectively,
“Similar Laws”), and entities or accounts whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such
plan, account or arrangement (each, a “Plan”).

**_General Fiduciary Matters_**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Part 4 of Title
I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of
an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises
any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition
of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an
ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine
whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the
Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**_Prohibited Transaction Issues_**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA,
or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party
in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes
and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged
in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.
The acquisition and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which any Issuer, a guarantor or an initial
purchaser is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired
and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this
regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply
to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting
transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance
company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting
life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset
managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither
the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority
or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction
and provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, nor pays no more, than adequate consideration in
connection with the transaction. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its
application. Fiduciaries of Plans considering acquiring and/or holdings the notes in reliance of these or any other
exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the
conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of
any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and
the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

389


-----

**_Representation_**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a note will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire
or hold the notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the purchase and holding of the notes
(or any interest therein) by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive nor should it be construed
as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in
non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering
purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential
applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption
would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. Purchasers have exclusive responsibility for ensuring
that their purchase and holding of the Notes do not violate the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction rules
of ERISA, the Code, or any applicable Similar Laws. Except as otherwise stated herein, the sale of any notes to a Plan
is in no respect a representation by the Issuers, an initial purchaser, or any of their respective affiliates or
representatives that such an investment meets all legal requirements with respect to such investments by any such Plan
generally or any particular Plan, or that such investment is appropriate for such Plans generally or any particular Plan.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

The Issuers and the guarantors have agreed not to, directly or indirectly,

391


-----

     - offer for sale, sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is
designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future
of) any of our debt securities substantially similar to the notes or securities convertible into or

for a period of 30 days after the date of this offering memorandum, in each case without the prior written
consent of the representatives, on behalf of the initial purchasers.

**Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may engage in certain transactions that stabilize,
maintain or otherwise affect the price of the notes. Specifically, the initial purchasers may overallot in connection
with the offering of the notes, creating a syndicate short position. In addition, the initial purchasers may bid for and
purchase notes in the open market to cover syndicate short positions or to stabilize the price of the notes. Any of these
activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the notes above what it would be in the absence of such
activities. The initial purchasers are not required to engage in any of these activities, and they may end any of them
at any time. The Issuers and the initial purchasers make no representation as to the direction or magnitude of any
effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither the Issuers nor
any of the initial purchasers make any representation that anyone will engage in such transactions or that such
transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Settlement**

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about     , 2021, which
is the business day following the date of the pricing of the notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+  ”).
Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the
next     succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+ , to
specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the
notes who wish to trade the notes during such period should consult their own advisors.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and certain of their respective affiliates or investment funds, separate accounts or other
entities owned (in whole or in part), controlled, managed and/or advised by their affiliates are full service financial
institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking,
financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and
brokerage activities. The initial purchasers and certain of their respective affiliates or investment funds, separate
accounts or other entities owned (in whole or in part), controlled, managed and/or advised by their affiliates have,
from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial and investment banking and
financial advisory services for the Issuers and their affiliates, for which they received or may in the future receive
customary fees and expenses. In particular, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates or investment funds,
separate accounts or other entities owned (in whole or in part), controlled, managed and/or advised by their affiliates
may be holders of our existing notes and/or lenders under our existing term loan facility and will receive a pro rata
portion of the net proceeds from this offering used to refinance such indebtedness. In addition, certain of the initial
purchasers or their affiliates are lenders and/or agents under our existing ABL facility and existing term loan facility,
and have entered into commitments in respect of our new ABL facility and new term loan facility and expect to enter

392


-----

into such facilities concurrent with the closing of this offering. In particular, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
is expected to be the administrative agent and collateral agent under such facilities for which it will receive customary
fees and commissions. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates also expect to enter into new credit facilities
with affiliates of ours, for which they will receive customary fees and commissions. Such initial purchasers or their
affiliates have received, will receive in connection with such new facilities, or may in the future receive, customary
fees and commissions for transactions under such facilities. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers or their
affiliates will be lenders and/or agents in respect of a financing agreement to be entered into by certain members of
the Investor Group in connection with the Transactions, for which they will receive customary fees and commissions.
This offering memorandum shall not constitute a notice of redemption with respect to any of the foregoing series of
notes or a notice of repayment with respect to the existing term loan facility, and any redemption of our existing notes
or repayment of our existing term loan facility will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant
indenture or such existing term loan facility, respectively.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates
or investment funds, separate accounts or other entities owned (in whole or in part), controlled, managed and/or
advised by their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities
(or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments
of the Issuers or their affiliates.

If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates or any investment fund, separate account or other entity
owned (in whole or in part), controlled, managed and/or advised by their affiliates has a lending relationship with us,
certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates or investment funds, separate accounts or other entities owned (in
whole or in part), controlled, managed and/or advised by their affiliates routinely hedge, and initial purchasers or their
affiliates or investment funds, separate accounts or other entities owned (in whole or in part), controlled, managed
and/or advised by their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk
management policies. Typically, these initial purchasers and their affiliates or investment funds, separate accounts or
other entities owned (in whole or in part), controlled, managed and/or advised by their affiliates would hedge such
exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of
short positions in our securities or the securities of our affiliates, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any
such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby.
The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates or investment funds, separate accounts or other entities owned (in
whole or in part), controlled, managed and/or advised by their affiliates may also communicate independent
investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in
respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long
and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

BC Partners Securities LLC, an affiliate of BC Partners, is one of the initial purchasers of this offering. BC
Partners Securities LLC will not confirm initial sales to any discretionary accounts over which it has authority without
the specific written approval of the customer.

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and unless so
registered, may not be offered or sold within the U.S., or to or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined
in Regulation S under the Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. See “Notice to Investors”. The
notes have no established trading market and will not be listed on any national securities exchange. The initial
purchasers have advised us of their intention to make a market for the notes, but have no obligation to do so and may
discontinue market-making at any time without providing any notice. The Issuers cannot assure you as to the liquidity
of any trading market for the notes.

The Issuers have been advised by the initial purchasers that the initial purchasers propose to resell these notes
to (a) persons they reasonably believe to be “qualified purchasers” (under Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment Company
Act) who are also qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (b) outside the

393


-----

Act. See “Notice to Investors.” Any offer or sale of the notes in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers
who are registered as such under the Exchange Act.

Each of the initial purchasers have acknowledged and agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase
agreement, in connection with sales outside the United States, they will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for
the account or benefit of U.S. persons (a) as part of their distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days after
the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes were originally issued. The initial purchasers will
send to each dealer to whom they sell the notes in reliance on Regulation S during the 40-day distribution compliance
period, a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United
States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings assigned
to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In addition, until the expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period referred to above, an offer or
sale of the notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule
144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

**Selling Restrictions**

No action has been taken by us or the initial purchasers that would permit a public offering of the securities
offered by this offering memorandum in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. The securities
offered by this offering memorandum may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this offering
memorandum or any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the offer and sale of any such
securities be distributed or published in any jurisdiction, except under circumstances that will result in compliance
with the applicable rules and regulations of that jurisdiction. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering and the
distribution of this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a
solicitation of an offer to buy any securities offered by this offering memorandum in any jurisdiction in which such
an offer or a solicitation is unlawful.

Apollo Global Securities, LLC, an initial purchaser in connection with this offering, shall not resell, and shall
not be deemed for any purpose to have resold, the notes offered hereby in connection with this offering to any
purchaser that is an affiliate or an investment fund, separate account or other entity owned (in whole or in part),
controlled, managed and/or advised by affiliates of Apollo Global Securities, LLC and any such notes purchased in
connection with this offering by an affiliate or an investment fund, separate account or other entity owned (in whole
or in part), controlled, managed and/or advised by affiliates of Apollo Global Securities, LLC shall be deemed to have
been resold by one or more initial purchasers other than Apollo Global Securities, LLC.

394


-----

(b) the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by means of sufficient information

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the
EEA or the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of
the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a

domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT**

PetSmart, Inc.
Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of PetSmart, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(the “Company”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, and
the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the
years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, and the related notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

**Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditors’ Responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

**Note 1 — The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Business_**

PetSmart, Inc., including its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries that we control (herein
collectively referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us,” unless the context requires otherwise), is a leading
specialty provider of products, services and solutions for the lifetime needs of pets. We offer a broad assortment of
products for all the life stages of pets, as well as various services, including professional grooming and boarding for
cats and dogs, and training and day camp for dogs. We also offer pet products through our e-commerce websites
(PetSmart.com, Chewy.com and OnlyNaturalPet.com) and maintain the content site PetMD.com. As of February 2,
2020, we operated 1,660 stores and had full-service veterinary hospitals, owned and operated by third-parties, in 848
of our stores.

On December 14, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Argos Holdings Inc. (“Argos
Holdings”) and Argos Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Argos Holdings. Argos
Holdings is indirectly controlled by Argos Intermediate Holdco I Inc. (“Intermediate Holdco I”), which is directly
controlled by a consortium including funds advised by BC Partners, Inc., La Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec,
affiliates of GIC Special Investments Pte Ltd, affiliates of StepStone Group LP, and Longview Asset Management,
LLC (collectively, the “Sponsors”). The transaction closed on March 11, 2015 (the “Transaction Date”). At closing,
Merger Sub was merged with and into PetSmart, Inc. (the “Merger”), with PetSmart, Inc. continuing as the surviving
corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Argos Holdings. Argos Holdings has no operating activity, and its sole
asset is its 100% ownership of PetSmart, Inc. We refer to the Merger on March 11, 2015 as the “Argos Transaction.”

The Company pays an aggregate of $4.0 million in annual management fees to select Sponsors, which are
related parties, under a service agreement entered into with the Sponsors on the Transaction Date, which are recorded
in operating, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Loss. The Company is subject to a termination fee equal to the net present value of the annual management fees that
would have been payable with respect to the period from the termination date through the twelfth (12th) anniversary
of the Transaction Date, or, if terminated following the twelfth (12th) anniversary of the Transaction Date, through
the first anniversary of the Transaction Date occurring after the termination date.

On April 17, 2017, we entered into an Agreement of Merger (the “Chewy Merger Agreement”) with Citrus
Merger Corp. (“Chewy Merger Sub”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc., and Chewy, Inc. On May 31,
2017 (the “Acquisition Date”), the transaction closed and as contemplated by the Chewy Merger Agreement, Chewy
Merger Sub merged with and into Chewy, Inc. (the “Chewy Merger”), with Chewy, Inc. surviving as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. We refer to the Chewy Merger and the acquisition of Chewy, Inc. by the Company on
May 31, 2017 herein as the “Chewy Acquisition.”

On July 2, 2018, we transitioned our online pet pharmacy business from PetSmart.com to Chewy.com. While
a portion of the online pet pharmacy activity legally resides within a wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. (the
“Pharmacy Subsidiary”) outside of Chewy, Inc., we have combined the financial results of the Pharmacy Subsidiary
with the financial results of Chewy, Inc. beginning on July 2, 2018 since Chewy, Inc. began to operate the online pet
pharmacy business, including the Pharmacy Subsidiary, at that time. We refer to Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries from
the Acquisition Date through July 2, 2018, and Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries plus the Pharmacy Subsidiary starting
on July 2, 2018, collectively as “Chewy.” The Pharmacy Subsidiary and Chewy, Inc. are also parties to a services
agreement that provides for the payment of a management fee by the Pharmacy Subsidiary to Chewy, Inc. for services
Chewy, Inc. provides to the Pharmacy Subsidiary. Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, Chewy, Inc. is entitled to
receive an amount equal to 25% of the Pharmacy Subsidiary’s net sales as fees for the services that it provides to the
Pharmacy Subsidiary. This management fee is eliminated in the combined Chewy financial results as well as the
consolidated results of the Company herein. We refer to our consolidated results, excluding Chewy, herein as
“PetSmart.”

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

On June 1, 2018, the board of directors of the Company declared and made a dividend in the form of 20.0%
of the outstanding common stock of Chewy, Inc. to its parent company, Argos Holdings. Also, on June 1, 2018, the
board of directors of Argos Holdings declared and made a dividend of this Chewy, Inc. common stock to its parent
company. Separately, on June 1, 2018, PetSmart, Inc. invested 16.5% of the outstanding common stock of Chewy,
Inc. in the form of a capital contribution to a wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. In connection
with these transactions, we incurred $61.2 million of costs, including $54.9 million related to the deferred tax impact,
directly associated with the change in ownership of Chewy, Inc. which were recorded to additional paid-in capital on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 3, 2019. These transactions were each approved by special committees
of disinterested directors of PetSmart and Argos Holdings, as applicable, each of which was advised by its own legal
and financial advisors.

On June 18, 2019, Chewy, Inc. completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of shares of Class A common
stock. A wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. sold 47,875,000 shares at $22.00 per share, including 6,975,000
shares sold upon exercise by the underwriters of the IPO of their option to purchase additional shares (“Shares Sold”).
The Company received net proceeds of $1,000.6 million from the sale of these shares after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions of $52.7 million. In addition, Chewy, Inc. sold 5,600,000 shares (“New Shares”) in the
IPO at $22.00 per share. Chewy, Inc. received net proceeds of $117.0 million from the New Shares after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.2 million.

Prior to completion of the IPO, Chewy, Inc.’s outstanding common stock was reclassified into Class B
common stock. The rights of the holders of Chewy, Inc. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are
identical, except with respect to voting, conversion and transfer rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled
to one vote. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes and is convertible at any time (and upon the
occurrence of certain events) into one share of Class A common stock. We refer to the IPO of Chewy, Inc. which was
completed on June 18, 2019 as the “Chewy IPO.”

On December 20, 2019, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. converted 6,352,546 shares of Chewy,
Inc. Class B common stock into Class A common stock and sold these shares at $27.95 per share pursuant to Rule
144 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”). Subsequently, on January 6, 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PetSmart, Inc. converted 3,850,000 shares of Chewy, Inc. Class B common stock into Class A common stock and sold
these shares at $28.75 per share also pursuant to Rule 144 of the Act (collectively, the “Rule 144 Transactions”). The
Company received net proceeds of $288.1 million from the Rule 144 Transactions after deducting commissions and
fees.

As of February 2, 2020, as a result of the Chewy IPO, the Rule 144 Transactions, and the vesting of restricted
stock units under the Chewy Omnibus Incentive Plan (refer to Note 7), the Company, through its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, owned 256,322,454 shares of Chewy, Inc. Class B common stock, which represented 63.9% of the total
outstanding shares of Chewy, Inc. common stock. This included 16.2% owned by a wholly-owned unrestricted
subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. and 47.7% owned by a wholly-owned restricted subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. Our Sponsors
own an additional 19.6% of Chewy, Inc. outstanding common stock, which is held by an entity outside of the
Company, and the remaining 16.5% is owned primarily by third-party investors. As of February 2, 2020, the shares
owned by wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company represented 75.0% of the combined voting power of Chewy,
Inc. common stock, and therefore, we continue to consolidate the financial results of Chewy, Inc.

**_Principles of Consolidation_**

Our consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned and
majority-owned subsidiaries that we control. We have eliminated all intercompany accounts and transactions.

**_Fiscal Year_**

Our fiscal years consist of 52 or 53-weeks and end on the Sunday nearest to January 31st. Fiscal year 2019,
which ended on February 2, 2020, was a 52-week year. Fiscal year 2018, which ended on February 3, 2019, was a 53week year. Fiscal year 2017, which ended on January 28, 2018, was a 52-week year. Unless otherwise specified, all
references to years in these consolidated financial statements are to fiscal years.

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period.
Management bases their estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions,
actual results could differ from these estimates.

**_Financial Instruments_**

Our short-term financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash,
receivables, accounts payable, accrued payroll, bonus, and employee benefits, and accrued occupancy expenses. These
balances, as presented in the consolidated financial statements as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019,
approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. Our long-term financial instruments consist primarily of
long-term debt, and are carried at historical cost as detailed in Note 10.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
or a liability. Accounting guidance prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the
categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value
measurement:

Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 – Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices
for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all
significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data.

Level 3 – Inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant
management judgment. Valuation techniques could include the use of discounted cash flow models and similar
techniques.

In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels
of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety
is classified is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our
assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and
considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

We consider any liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Included
in cash and cash equivalents are credit and debit card receivables from banks, which typically settle within five
business days, of $130.8 million and $112.2 million as of February 2, 2020, and February 3, 2019, respectively. Cash
equivalents also consist of institutional money market funds and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Under our cash management system, a book overdraft balance exists for our primary disbursement accounts.
This overdraft represents uncleared checks in excess of cash balances in the related bank accounts. Our funds are
transferred on an as-needed basis to pay for clearing checks. As of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, book
overdrafts of $28.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively, were included in accounts payable and book overdraft on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

**_Vendor Allowances_**

We receive vendor allowances from agreements made with certain merchandise suppliers in the form of
percentage or volume rebates. Additionally, certain vendors provide funding for discounts relating to our online autoship subscription program which are passed on to our customers. Rebates are generally determined using agreed upon
percentages. However, certain of our vendor rebates are dependent upon reaching minimum purchase thresholds. In
these instances, we evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current forecasts.
When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated and it is probable that minimum purchase thresholds will be met,
we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress toward the purchase threshold. Generally, rebates received from
vendors are recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of our inventory, and therefore, such amounts are ultimately
recognized as a reduction to cost of merchandise sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss when the inventory is sold.

Prior to fiscal year 2018, we also received vendor allowances in the form of temporary price reductions.
Temporary price reductions were typically 4-5 week promotional periods during which we agreed to reduce the retail
price of certain merchandise, and vendors reimbursed us at a price per unit for actual units sold during the period.
Temporary price reductions were recorded as direct reductions to cost of merchandise sales on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss when the inventory was sold.

We also receive vendor allowances in the form of advertising funding agreements. Beginning in fiscal year
2018, in connection with our annual vendor negotiations, we made changes to certain merchandise vendor contracts
which allow us greater flexibility in the way we use certain vendor allowances. As a result of these changes, these
vendor allowances are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of our inventory and, therefore, are ultimately
recognized as a reduction to cost of merchandise sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss when the inventory is sold. Under our vendor contracts prior to fiscal year 2018, advertising
vendor allowances were either related to specifically identifiable advertising costs incurred to promote and sell vendor
products or allowed for general marketing activities. Vendor allowances for specifically identifiable advertising costs
were recorded as a direct reduction to operating, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Vendor allowances for general marketing were recorded as a direct reduction
to cost of merchandise sales on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

Additionally, we receive vendor allowances as reimbursements of costs incurred for certain fixtures used to
display and sell our suppliers’ products. Vendor allowances for fixtures are recorded as a reduction to operating,
general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Finally,
we receive allowances for defective products and non-compliance with our shipping standards which are recorded as
reductions to cost of merchandise sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

**_Merchandise Inventories and Valuation Reserves_**

Merchandise inventories represent finished goods and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
We use a combination of the moving average cost method and the first-in first-out (FIFO) method when determining
the value of inventory. Inventory balances include inbound freight and customs fees on imported products.

We have established reserves for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventories. Physical
inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in our stores and inventory is adjusted accordingly. Stores generally
perform physical inventories at least once per year and count certain inventory items between physical inventories.
Distribution and fulfillment centers perform cycle counts on a regular basis. For each reporting period presented, we
estimate the inventory shrinkage based on historical trends. Changes in shrink results or market conditions could cause
actual results to vary from estimates used to establish the reserves.

We also have reserves for estimated inventory obsolescence and to reduce merchandise inventory to the lower
of cost or net realizable value. We evaluate inventory for excess, obsolescence, or other factors that may render
inventories unmarketable at historical cost. Factors used in determining obsolescence reserves, which are recorded to
reflect approximate net realizable value of our inventories, include current and anticipated demand, customer
preferences, age of merchandise, seasonal trends, and decisions to discontinue certain products. If assumptions about

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

future demand change, or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, we may
require additional reserves.

As of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, our inventory valuation reserves were $20.7 million and
$25.4 million, respectively.

**_Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets_**

Prepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following (in thousands):

**February 2, 2020** **February 3, 2019**
Prepaid expenses...................................................................... $ 76,014 $ 116,047
Other[(a)] ..................................................................................... 3,014 3,219
Prepaid expenses and other current assets ............................... $ 79,028 $ 119,266

(a) There were no other individual items within prepaid expenses and other current assets greater than 5% of
total current assets.

**_Property and Equipment_**

Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is
provided on furniture, fixtures, equipment, computer software and buildings using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements and finance right-of-use assets are amortized
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Computer software consists primarily of third-party software purchased for internal use. Costs associated with the
preliminary stage of a project are expensed as incurred. In the development phase, qualifying external and internal
costs, such as payroll and payroll-related costs of employees, external consulting, and internal labor costs directly
associated with developing significant computer software applications for internal use are capitalized. Training costs,
data conversion costs, and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Maintenance and repairs to furniture, fixtures,
and equipment are expensed as incurred.

We review property and equipment for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows on a quarterly basis
and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. If this review indicates that the carrying amount of the property and equipment is not recoverable, we
recognize an impairment loss, which is determined by calculating the fair value of the assets using estimated
discounted cash flows. We recognized impairment charges for property and equipment of $13.0 million, $4.8 million,
and $5.5 million related to under-performing stores, stores that were scheduled to be closed, and natural disasters for
the year ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, respectively.

Our property and equipment are depreciated using the following typical estimated useful lives:

Finance lease assets ............................................................. Shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life
Furniture, fixtures, and equipment ....................................... 2 to 10 years
Leasehold improvements ..................................................... 1 to 20 years
Computer software .............................................................. 3 to 7 years
Buildings.............................................................................. 39 years

Refer to Note 5 for further discussion regarding property and equipment.

**_Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets_**

The carrying value of goodwill was $7,687.0 million as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019 and
represents the excess of the consideration transferred to the acquired businesses over the fair market value of their net
assets. Goodwill as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019 primarily relates to the excess of the purchase price
consideration over net assets in relation to both the Chewy Acquisition and the Argos Transaction. We also had

F 12


-----

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

$2,380.0 million of trade name intangible assets determined to have indefinite-lives as of February 2, 2020 and
February 3, 2019.

The Company performs its review for potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
annually during the fourth quarter unless a triggering event occurs which would require that the review be performed
earlier. In performing the annual goodwill impairment review, we determined the consolidated reporting entity to have
the following two operating units which also represent two separate reporting units: PetSmart and Chewy. We may
elect to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our reporting
units is less than the carrying amount prior to performing a quantitative impairment test. If this is the case, a
quantitative impairment test is required. If it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is not less
than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required. If a quantitative impairment test is required,
or if we choose to bypass the optional qualitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its
carrying amount (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a
goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its
fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit under the quantitative impairment test is determined using a combination
of valuation methodologies, including a discounted cash flow analysis, a guideline public company analysis, and a
guideline transaction analysis.

When evaluating indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired. In performing
this qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that
impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and
circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, we are required to calculate the fair value
of the intangible asset group.

Refer to Note 3 and Note 4 for further discussion regarding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

**_Definite-Lived Intangible Assets_**

As of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, we had $336.4 million and $406.9 million of definite-lived
intangible assets, respectively, net of amortization, primarily associated with the Chewy Acquisition and the Argos
Transaction. Intangible assets determined to have definite-lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging
from 2 to 12 years, or the remaining assumed lease term for below market leasehold positions. Below market leasehold
positions and related accumulated amortization were reclassified to operating right-of-use assets, net, on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets upon our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic
_842), as of the first day of fiscal year 2019._

We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If this review
indicates that the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible assets is not recoverable, we recognize an
impairment loss, which is measured at fair value using estimated discounted cash flows.

Refer to Note 4 for further discussion regarding definite-lived intangible assets.

**_Insurance Liabilities and Reserves_**

We maintain workers’ compensation, general liability, product liability, property insurance and other types
of insurance policies related to our operations, properties, and leasehold interests. For some associates, we maintain
full coverage health insurance plans. For all other eligible associates, we maintain self-insured health plans. Workers’
compensation policies generally carry a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible exposure. Our general liability policies
specify a $1.0 million per occurrence self-insured retention. We establish reserves for claims under workers’
compensation and general liability plans based on periodic actuarial estimates of the amount of loss for all pending
claims, including estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported. Our loss estimates rely on actuarial
observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events, and changes in such assumptions could result in
an adjustment, favorable or adverse, to our reserves. As of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, we had

F 13


-----

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

approximately $81.7 million and $79.6 million, respectively, in reserves related to workers’ compensation, general
liability, and self-insured health plans, of which $46.9 million and $48.1 million were classified as other noncurrent
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

**_Other Current Liabilities_**

Other current liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):

**February 2, 2020** **February 3, 2019**
Accrued income and sales tax .................................................... $ 112,243 $ 59,427
Accrued outbound fulfillment and delivery ............................... 182,589 150,068
Accrued interest ......................................................................... 83,073 94,599
Accrued advertising ................................................................... 80,495 94,622
Non-trade accounts payable ....................................................... 95,543 76,285
Other[(a)] ....................................................................................... 162,869 144,389
Other current liabilities .............................................................. $ 716,812 $ 619,390

(a) There were no other individual items within other current liabilities greater than 5% of total current
liabilities.

**_Income Taxes_**

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred taxes are
measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the assets or liabilities are expected to be realized.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for any portion that is not more likely than not to be realized.

The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
as income tax expense.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to
as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). The Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. tax code. In the period
ended January 28, 2018, we recorded a provisional discrete net tax benefit associated with the Tax Act and related
matters. For the year ended February 3, 2019, we finalized our accounting for the Tax Act in accordance with
Securities and Exchange Commission guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, and the impact recorded was not
material.

As of February 3, 2019, we finalized our policy and have elected to use the period cost method for global
intangible low-tax income provisions and therefore have not adjusted any of the deferred tax assets or liabilities of our
foreign subsidiaries for the new tax.

Refer to Note 8 for further discussion regarding income taxes.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Revenue is recognized net of applicable sales tax on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss. We record the sales tax liability in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We recognize revenue for store merchandise sales when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the
register. We recognize revenue from professional grooming, boarding, and dog training when the services are
performed. Ship-to-home internet sales are recognized once an online order has shipped from one of our fulfillment
centers and delivered to the carrier. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to customers are reflected
in merchandise sales, and the related costs are reflected in cost of merchandise sales. Buy-online, pick-up in store
sales are recognized once the customer has picked up their order from our store.

F 14


-----

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

To encourage customers to purchase our products and services, we periodically provide incentive offers.
Generally, these promotions include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases and
other similar offers. These offers, when accepted by the customer, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of
the related transaction. These offers are included in net sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss.

We record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue in net sales when cards are
redeemed. Gift card breakage income is recognized over two years based upon historical redemption patterns and
represents the balance of gift cards for which we believe the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote.
We recognized $2.7 million, $2.6 million, and $3.2 million of gift card breakage income for the years ended
February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, respectively.

We record allowances for estimated returns based on historical return patterns. These allowances were not
material as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019.

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, _Revenue from_
_Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was further clarified and amended. The standard creates a_
comprehensive and converged standard on revenue recognition that supersedes revenue recognition requirements in
Topic 605 and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For public companies, as well as certain nonprofit
entities and employee benefit plans, this standard was effective for years beginning after December 15, 2017, and
interim periods within those years. For private companies, the standard was effective for years beginning after
December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. In each case, early adoption was permitted.

We adopted the standard on the first day of fiscal year 2018 using the modified retrospective transition
method. As a result of our adoption of the standard, gift card breakage, which was previously recorded as a reduction
to operating, general, and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other
Comprehensive Loss, is now recorded in other revenue. In addition, the balance sheet presentation of our sales return
reserve has changed to present a separate return asset and liability, instead of the net presentation in prior periods as
commonly used under previous GAAP. The return asset and liability are included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finally, under the
standard, we defer revenue related to certain promotional offers that are determined to represent a material right to the
customer. We recognize this revenue in net sales at the earlier of when the promotional offer is redeemed or expires.
None of the changes as a result of the standard required us to make a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening
balance of our accumulated deficit under the modified retrospective transition method, and none of the changes had a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Our net sales amount represents total revenue recognized from purchases of products and services by
customers, with the exception of sublease income and reimbursements for specific operating expenses charged to
third-party veterinary offices located within many of our stores under our agreements with them, which are included
in other revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. We recognized sublease
income and reimbursements for specific operating costs from third-party veterinary offices of $42.7 million,
$43.3 million, and $44.6 million for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018,
respectively. The related costs are included in cost of other revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss.

**_Customer Loyalty Program_**

During 2018, we implemented a customer loyalty program, PetSmart Treats, in which members earn points
primarily based on purchases in our stores and on PetSmart.com. Points earned by members are valid for at least one
year and may be redeemed against purchases of merchandise or services in our stores or on PetSmart.com. The
PetSmart Treats loyalty program represents a contract with each member that creates enforceable rights and
obligations. In exchange for the member’s consideration, the member is granted the right to a specified number of
loyalty points. The points earned are a distinct promise from the original purchase that can be exchanged for future

F 15

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

goods or services, which creates a performance obligation for the Company to provide goods or services until those
points are redeemed or expire.

The Company allocates revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defers recognition until the
points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which
includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed. The estimated redemption rate is based on historical
experience and other assumptions. The Company defers the value of points earned that are estimated to be redeemed
at the time of the initial purchase in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the points are
redeemed. As of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, deferred revenue related to the PetSmart Treats program was
$29.5 million and $19.9 million, respectively. Revenue recognized for redeemed points was $115.8 million and $14.4
million for the years ended February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, respectively.

**_Cost of Merchandise Sales_**

Cost of merchandise sales includes the following types of expenses:

- Purchase price of inventory sold;

- Transportation costs associated with inventory;

- Inventory shrinkage costs and valuation adjustments;

- Costs associated with operating our distribution network, including payroll and benefit costs, occupancy costs, utilities
costs, and depreciation;

- Costs associated with storage and handling of inventory;

- Store occupancy costs, including rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, and depreciation of
leasehold improvements and finance lease assets; and

- Reductions for vendor funded promotions, discounts, rebates, temporary price reductions, defective products, noncompliance and general marketing activities.

**_Cost of Services Sales_**

Cost of services sales primarily relates to payroll and benefit expenses for PetSmart-employed groomers,
trainers, and PetsHotel associates. Also included in cost of services sales are services-related costs for supplies and
repairs, as well as professional fees for the training of groomers, trainers, and PetsHotel associates.

**_Cost of Other Revenue_**

Cost of other revenue includes the costs related to license fees and specific operating expenses charged to
third-party veterinary offices located within many of our stores.

**_Vendor Concentration Risk_**

We purchase merchandise inventories from several hundred vendors worldwide. Sales of products from our
three largest vendors represented approximately 32.2%, 32.5%, and 30.9% of our merchandise sales for the years
ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, respectively.

**_Leases_**

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which was subsequently modified
through several additional ASUs (collectively, the “Lease Standard”). The Lease Standard is intended to increase

F 16


-----

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance
sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under prior GAAP. The Lease Standard requires that a lessee
should recognize a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset representing its right to use the
underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. We adopted the Lease Standard by recognizing a cumulative
effect adjustment as of the first day of fiscal year 2019, and as a result, we did not adjust prior periods. We elected the
package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance which allowed us not to reassess the
identification, classification and initial direct costs of existing leases as of the adoption date. Additionally, as of the
adoption date, we adjusted the carrying value of the lease liability for cumulative prepaid or accrued lease payments,
deferred lease incentives, unamortized initial direct costs, and above and below market leasehold positions, to arrive
at the ROU asset. The adoption of the Lease Standard resulted in the recognition of operating ROU assets and operating
lease liabilities of $1,849.0 million and $1,860.9 million, respectively. In addition, we recorded a decrease to
accumulated deficit of $15.2 million, less taxes of $3.6 million, as of February 4, 2019, primarily due to the
reassessment of our build-to-suit leases under the Lease Standard. For build-to-suit leases that were determined to be
operating leases under the Lease Standard, we derecognized the capital lease asset and liability and recorded the
difference to accumulated deficit. There was not a material net impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Loss or Statements of Cash Flows.

We lease the vast majority of our stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and
corporate offices generally under noncancelable operating and finance leases. For accounting purposes, the lease term
begins at the earlier of the date we become legally obligated for the rent payments or when we take possession of the
rental space. Generally, real estate leases require additional payments for property taxes, utilities, common area
maintenance, and insurance. Additionally, certain real estate leases contain provisions for future rent increases, rent
abatements, other incentives, or rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. We also lease certain equipment
under operating and finance leases. Our leases may involve significant assumptions and judgments to identify the
underlying real estate space or equipment subject to the lease and the discount rate used to calculate the present value
of remaining fixed lease payments over the lease term. The Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit
rate. Therefore, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined on a collateralized basis, in determining
the present value of future lease payments based on information available at the lease commencement date.

We record operating and finance lease ROU assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the sum of
the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for initial direct costs and lease incentives. We measure the
operating and finance lease obligations based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at
the commencement date. The initial measurement of the ROU assets and lease obligations include fixed payments
included in our lease agreements. The Company generally does not include renewal options in its determination of the
lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease commencement. We elected the practical
expedient to account for each separate lease component and non-lease component associated with our leases as a
single lease component for real estate leases. Rental payments are recognized as a reduction of the operating and
finance lease obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. We depreciate finance lease ROU assets over the term of the lease
and recognize interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. We have other
short-term leases with terms less than one-year. We elected not to apply the recognition requirements of the Lease
Standard to short-term leases, and as such, we recognize lease payments of short-term leases on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. Adjustments to lease payments due to inflation subsequent to lease commencement are recognized
in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred on the Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Loss.

Refer to Note 11 for further discussion regarding leases.

**_Advertising_**

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, except for television and radio airtime and store grand opening
costs, which are expensed the first time the advertising takes place, and are classified within operating, general, and
administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Total advertising

F 17


-----

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

expenses, including direct response advertising, net of vendor allowances, were $548.3 million, $516.9 million, and
$340.8 million for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, respectively.

Vendor allowances for advertising agreements reduced total advertising expense by $2.8 million,
$1.1 million, and $35.4 million for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018,
respectively.

**_Equity Compensation_**

We recognize equity compensation based on the fair value of awards from the Company’s equity plans.
Equity awards are amortized using the graded amortization method over the vesting period, net of estimated
forfeitures. Equity compensation expense is classified within operating, general, and administrative expenses on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Stock Compensation; Improvements to Nonemployee Share_Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718). The amendments in this ASU expand the scope of Topic 718 to include_
share-based payment awards to be issued to non-employees in exchange for acquiring goods and services. The ASU
aligned the accounting for awards issued to non-employees to be similar to employee awards. This standard was
effective for interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We
adopted the provisions in this ASU on the first day of fiscal year 2019, which did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

Refer to Note 7 for further discussion regarding equity compensation.

**_Noncontrolling Interests_**

Noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements represents the percentage of ownership
interests in Chewy, Inc. held by parties outside of PetSmart, Inc. As of February 3, 2019, noncontrolling interests
represented a 20.0% ownership in Chewy, Inc. that was owned by a related-party entity controlled by our Sponsors.
During the year ended February 2, 2020, the noncontrolling interests percentage of Chewy, Inc. changed due to shares
of Class A common stock sold during the Chewy IPO and the Rule 144 Transactions as well as settlement of restricted
stock units under the Chewy Omnibus Incentive Plan (refer to Note 7). As of February 2, 2020, noncontrolling interests
represented a 36.1% ownership interest in Chewy, Inc. held by parties outside of PetSmart, Inc., including 19.6%
owned by a related-party entity controlled by our Sponsors. Since the Company retained a controlling interest in
Chewy, Inc., the financial results of Chewy, Inc. are included in our consolidated financial statements. Changes in the
ownership interest in Chewy, Inc. that do not cause the Company to lose its controlling interest of Chewy, Inc. are
accounted for as equity transactions which adjust noncontrolling interests and additional paid-in capital.

The Company presents noncontrolling interests as a component of stockholders’ equity on its Consolidated
Balance Sheets and reports the portion of loss for noncontrolling interests as net loss attributable to noncontrolling
interests on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. During the year ended February 2,
2020, the noncontrolling interests percentages before and after the completion of the Chewy IPO, the Rule 144
Transactions and the settlement of restricted stock units under the Chewy Omnibus Incentive Plan were used to
calculate the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss.

Refer to Note 6 for further discussion regarding noncontrolling interests.

**_Concentration of Credit Risk_**

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents
in highly rated financial institutions and amounts may exceed federally insured limits. Concentration of credit risk on
accounts receivable is limited due to the nature of the Company’s receivables.

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

**_Foreign Currency_**

The local currency of the country in which a subsidiary operates is designated as the functional currency for
all of our subsidiaries. We translate assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency into United States dollars at
the current rate of exchange at period-end and translate revenues and expenses at the average exchange rate for the
period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive (loss) income and are reported
in equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Transaction gains and losses are included in net loss on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and were not material for the years ended February 2, 2020,
February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018, respectively.

**Note 2 — Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements**

**_Adopted in 2019_**

_Leases_

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which was subsequently modified
through several additional ASUs. We adopted this standard as of the first day of fiscal year 2019. Refer to Leases in
Note 1 for further discussion on the adoption of this standard.

_Equity Compensation_

In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Stock Compensation; Improvements to Nonemployee Share_Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718). We adopted the provisions in this ASU on the first day of fiscal year 2019,_
which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Equity Compensation in Note
1 for further discussion on the adoption of this standard.

_Statement of Cash Flows_

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash
_Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230). The amendments in this ASU address the following eight specific cash flow_
issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt
instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing;
contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance
claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies including bank-owned life insurance
policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and
separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. For public companies, this standard
is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with earlier adoption
permitted. For private companies, this standard is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim
periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019, with earlier adoption permitted. We adopted the
provisions in this ASU on the first day of fiscal year 2019, which did not have a material impact on our Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.

_Income Taxes_

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting
_for Income Taxes. The amendments in this ASU simplify the accounting for income taxes, changes the accounting for_
certain income tax transactions, and makes other minor changes. The amendments are primarily prospective. We
adopted the provisions in this ASU during fiscal year 2019, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

_Comprehensive Income (Loss)_

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income
_(Topic 220). The amendments in this ASU allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income_
(loss) to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act. This standard is
effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018,
with earlier adoption permitted. We adopted the provisions in this ASU on the first day of fiscal year 2019, which did
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

**_Not Yet Adopted_**

There were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted that we believe
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

**Note 3 — Acquisitions and Goodwill**

**_Chewy Acquisition_**

As discussed in Note 1, we completed the Chewy Acquisition on May 31, 2017, and as contemplated by the
Chewy Merger Agreement, Chewy Merger Sub merged with and into Chewy, Inc., with Chewy, Inc. surviving as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. Total consideration for the Merger was comprised of: (i) $3,000.0 million
aggregate purchase price for all outstanding shares of Chewy, Inc.’s capital stock (including options and restricted
shares), and (ii) fees and expenses related to the Chewy Acquisition to be assumed by PetSmart, Inc., subject to
adjustments as set forth in the Chewy Merger Agreement, including adjustments to reflect closing date debt and cash
of Chewy, Inc., the aggregate exercise price of outstanding options under Chewy, Inc.’s equity award plan, and fees
and expenses of Chewy, Inc.’s professional advisors related to the Chewy Acquisition in excess of $25.0 million, as
well as post-closing working capital adjustments (collectively, “Acquisition Consideration”). Of the total cash
consideration, $15.5 million was deposited into escrow as a hold-back subject to the determination of post-closing
working capital and other adjustments. During the year ended January 28, 2018, the $15.5 million was released from
escrow, with $11.2 million being paid to the former shareholders of Chewy, Inc. net of a working capital deficit
adjustment which was returned to PetSmart, Inc.

Pursuant to the Chewy Merger Agreement, each share of capital stock of Chewy, Inc. outstanding
immediately prior to the Acquisition Date was converted to a right to receive a proportionate share of the aggregate
Acquisition Consideration payable by PetSmart, Inc. All unvested options outstanding immediately prior to the
Acquisition Date under Chewy, Inc.’s equity award plan were deemed fully vested, and all outstanding and
unexercised options were converted into the right to receive a portion of the aggregate Acquisition Consideration, net
of the exercise price. All unvested restricted stock awards outstanding immediately prior to the Acquisition Date under
Chewy, Inc.’s equity award plan were deemed fully vested. Restricted stock awards were treated as shares of capital
stock of Chewy, Inc. and converted into the right to receive a proportionate share of the aggregate Acquisition
Consideration. A portion of the proceeds related to the accelerated outstanding options and restricted stock awards
was deposited into escrow subject to a six-month service period requirement. The total fair value of the consideration
deposited into escrow was $33.9 million, which was amortized over the six-month post-acquisition service period
within operating, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss during the year ended January 28, 2018.

The Chewy Acquisition was financed through (i) the issuance of $1,350.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of 5.875% senior first lien notes due 2025, (ii) the issuance of $650.0 million in aggregate principal amount
of 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2025, (iii) $1,000.0 million of Sponsors’ cash equity contributions, and (iv) cash
on hand. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion on the 5.875% senior first lien notes due 2025 and the 8.875% senior
unsecured notes due 2025.

_Direct Transaction Costs_

Direct transaction costs associated with the Chewy Acquisition of $64.9 million consisting primarily of
professional fees, were expensed as incurred within operating, general, and administrative expenses on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended January 28, 2018. Included in
these transaction costs were $30.1 million in structuring fees paid to Sponsors, a related party. No transaction costs
for the Chewy Acquisition were recognized for the years ended February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019.

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill is the excess of the consideration transferred to an acquired entity over the net amounts assigned
to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. No goodwill impairments were identified for the years ended February 2,
2020, February 3, 2019, or January 28, 2018. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, which is not subject to
amortization, were as follows (in thousands):

**Years Ended**
**February 2, 2020** **February 3, 2019**
**(52-weeks)** **(53-weeks)**
Beginning goodwill balance ................................................................ $ 7,687,007 $ 7,687,021
Chewy Acquisition including measurement period adjustments ......... — (14)
Ending goodwill balance ..................................................................... $ 7,687,007 $ 7,687,007

**Note 4 — Intangible Assets**

Intangible assets determined to be indefinite-lived consisted of trade names and were $2,380.0 million as of
February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019. No impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets were recognized for the
year ended February 2, 2020.

Due to the declining performance of the brick-and-mortar retail industry that impacts the estimated long-term
growth rate of our PetSmart trade name, we determined it necessary to perform a quantitative assessment of the fair
value of the indefinite-lived trade name during the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result of this assessment, we recognized
an impairment charge of $269.4 million for the year ended February 3, 2019, which was classified within operating,
general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The
fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name was calculated using the relief from royalty method (Level 3 inputs).

Due to declining net sales related to the PetSmart trade name in the fourth quarter of 2017, we determined it
was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment of the fair value of the indefinite-lived PetSmart trade name. As a
result of this assessment, we recognized an impairment charge of $399.4 million for the year ended January 28, 2018,
which was classified within operating, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name was calculated using the relief
from royalty method (Level 3 inputs).

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we made the decision to dissolve the majority of the remaining operations
of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pet360, Inc. (“Pet360”), and therefore, we determined the fair value of its indefinitelived trade names to be zero. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $6.1 million for the year ended
January 28, 2018, which was classified within operating, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

Intangible assets determined to have definite-lives were as follows (in thousands):

**As of February 2, 2020**
**Gross Carrying** **Accumulated** **Net Book**

**Amount** **Amortization** **Value**

Trade names, trademarks, and domain names ................................... $ 2,343 $ (437) $ 1,906

Intangible assets, subject to amortization .......................................... $ 476,586 $ (69,651) $ 406,935


Below market leasehold positions and related accumulated amortization were reclassified to operating lease
right-of-use assets, net, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets upon our adoption of the Lease Standard. See Note 1 for
additional discussion. No material impairments of definite-lived intangible assets were recognized for the years ended
February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we made the decision to dissolve the majority of the remaining operations
of Pet360, and therefore, we determined the fair value of its remaining definite-lived intangible assets to be zero. As
a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $6.3 million for the year ended January 28, 2018, primarily related
to the definite-lived content and customer relationships associated with our acquisition of Pet360, which was classified
within operating, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss. No other material impairments were recognized for the year ended January 28, 2018.

For the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018 we recognized $36.0 million,
$38.3 million, and $28.1 million, respectively, of amortization expense on definite-lived intangible assets. The
following table reflects the estimated amortization expense relative to definite-lived intangible assets recognized on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 2, 2020, for each of the next five years and the remaining years
thereafter (in thousands):

**February 2, 2020** **February 3, 2019**
Property and equipment, net ......................................................... $ 843,594 $ 1,007,972

Accumulated amortization of buildings recorded under finance leases was $258.2 million and $287.9 million
as of February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, respectively. All other property and equipment finance leases were
immaterial.

Depreciation and finance lease amortization expense for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019,
and January 28, 2018 was $245.9 million, $280.2 million, and $287.8 million, respectively.

**Note 6 — Stockholders’ Equity**

As discussed in Note 3, the Chewy Acquisition during the year ended January 28, 2018 was funded, in part,
through additional cash equity contributions of $1,000.0 million from the Sponsors. For the year ended January 28,
2018, we declared and paid a total of $9.2 million in cash dividends to our parent, Argos Holdings. As discussed in
Note 1, for the year ended February 3, 2019, we declared a dividend in the form of 20.0% of the outstanding common
stock of Chewy, Inc. to our parent. For the year ended February 2, 2020, we declared and paid a total of $3.7 million
in cash dividends to our parent (see Note 7 for further discussion). We do not expect material dividends to be recurring.

As discussed in Note 1, during the year ended February 2, 2020, Chewy, Inc. completed an IPO and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. sold shares of Chewy, Inc. Class A common stock in the Rule 144
Transactions. The total net proceeds received from the Shares Sold as part of the Chewy IPO, less estimated income
taxes and offering costs, in excess of our accounting basis for the Shares Sold, resulted in an increase to additional
paid-in capital of $839.8 million, partially offset by an increase to noncontrolling interests of $351.9 million during
the year ended February 2, 2020. The total net proceeds received from the New Shares sold as part of the Chewy IPO,
less offering costs, resulted in an increase to additional paid-in capital of $110.3 million, partially offset by an increase
to noncontrolling interests of $64.1 million during the year ended February 2, 2020. The total net proceeds received
from the Rule 144 Transactions, less estimated income taxes and offering costs, in excess of our accounting basis for
the Rule 144 Transactions, resulted in an increase to additional paid-in capital of $236.3 million, partially offset by an
increase to noncontrolling interests of $68.5 million during the year ended February 2, 2020.

We decreased additional paid-in capital by $12.7 million for the settlement of restricted stock units (“RSUs”),
including related tax withholdings, under the Chewy 2019 Plan as defined and discussed in Note 7. We increased
noncontrolling interests by $12.5 million for the settlement of RSUs. Additionally, we increased additional paid-in
capital for other adjustments to noncontrolling interests of $26.5 million during the year ended February 2, 2020 as
detailed below (in thousands):

**Year Ended**
**February 2, 2020**
Intercompany loan termination[(a)] ............................................................................................. $ (26,345)
Intercompany tax benefit ......................................................................................................... (56,447)
Equity compensation adjustments ........................................................................................... 50,519
Other adjustments .................................................................................................................... 5,732
Decrease to noncontrolling interests ........................................................................................ $ (26,541)

(a) PetSmart, Inc. and Chewy, Inc. were parties to an intercompany loan agreement pursuant to which each
party made loans from time to time to each other. The intercompany loan agreement was terminated during
the year ended February 2, 2020 in connection with the Chewy IPO without cash repayment of the
outstanding loan of $79.5 million from PetSmart, Inc. to Chewy, Inc. Other than adjusting the
intercompany loan balance for the percentage of noncontrolling interests at the time of termination, there
was no impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of the termination of this intercompany
loan agreement because it is eliminated upon consolidation.

**Note 7 — Equity Compensation**

**_Chewy Omnibus Incentive Plan_**

In June 2019, Chewy, Inc.’s board of directors adopted and approved the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan
(the “Chewy 2019 Plan”). The Chewy 2019 Plan became effective on June 13, 2019 and provides for the issuance of
up to 31,864,865 shares of Class A common stock. No awards may be granted under the Chewy 2019 Plan after June
2029.

The Chewy 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, including incentive stock options, non-qualified
stock options, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, stock payments, RSUs, performance shares, other incentive
awards, stock appreciation rights, and cash awards (collectively, the “Chewy Awards”). The Chewy Awards may be
granted to employees of Chewy, Inc., consultants, and directors, and the employees and consultants of Chewy, Inc.’s
affiliates and subsidiaries.

_Restricted Stock Units_

In connection with the consummation of the Chewy IPO, Chewy, Inc. granted RSUs under the Chewy 2019
Plan. Certain of the RSUs vest upon satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition (the “Service Condition”)
and a performance-based vesting condition (the “Share Price Condition”) as described below.

The Service Condition will be satisfied with respect to 25% of an employee’s RSUs on the first anniversary
of the Chewy 2019 Plan’s registration date and then with respect to 12.5% of an employee’s RSUs at the end of each
six-month period thereafter, subject to the employee’s continued employment with Chewy, Inc. through the applicable
vesting date.

The Share Price Condition shall be satisfied with respect to a percentage of an employee’s RSUs, as and
when the price per share of Class A common stock specified (each, a “Share Price Hurdle”) is achieved, on a volume
adjusted weighted-average basis, on every trading day during a consecutive 45-trading day period completed prior to
the fifth anniversary of the Chewy 2019 Plan’s effective date subject to the employee’s continued employment with
Chewy, Inc. through the applicable vesting date.

_Restricted Stock Unit Activity_

The following table summarizes the activity related to the RSUs under the Chewy 2019 Plan for the year
ended February 2, 2020, (in thousands, except for weighted average grant date fair value):

**Year Ended February 2, 2020**

**Weighted-Average**

**Number of RSUs** **Grant Date Fair Value**

Unvested at beginning of period ............................................................. — $ —
Granted ................................................................................................... 26,677 36.31
Vested ..................................................................................................... (2,778) 36.86
Forfeited ................................................................................................. (2,615) 36.62
Unvested at end of period ....................................................................... 21,284 $ 36.20

The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the year ended February 2, 2020 was $103.3 million. As of
February 2, 2020, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $192.3 million and is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average performance period of 1.9 years.

F 24


-----

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

The fair value of the RSUs with Share Price Hurdles was determined on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo
model to simulate total stockholder return for Chewy, Inc. and peer companies with the following assumptions:

Performance period **5 years**
Weighted-average risk-free interest rate .............................................................................................. 1.8%
Weighted-average volatility................................................................................................................. 49.6%
Weighted-average dividend yield ........................................................................................................ —%

The risk-free interest rate utilized is based on a 5-year term-matched zero-coupon U.S. Treasury security
yield at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the stock of the Chewy, Inc.’s peer
firms.

As of February 2, 2020, there were 7.8 million additional shares of Class A common stock of Chewy, Inc.
reserved for future issuance under the Chewy 2019 Plan.

**_Profits Interest Plans_**

_Argos Profits Interest Plan_

Subsequent to the Argos Transaction, Argos Holdings L.P. (the “Argos Partnership”), an indirect parent of
Argos Holdings, granted equity interests in the Argos Partnership to certain employees in the form of Special Class
A-2 Units, which fully vested upon grant, as well as profits interest units under the Argos Profits Interest Plan (“Argos
Profits Interest Units”). These grants are subject to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of the Argos
Partnership. The grants are non-transferable and are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions. In addition, the
Argos Partnership has the right to repurchase all or a portion of the vested equity interests after termination of a
grantee’s employment.

Argos Profits Interest Units are generally subject to time-based vesting. These awards typically vest
20% after one year of service and 1.667% per month thereafter with full vesting occurring upon five years of service.
The Argos Profits Interest Plan expires in 2025.

Activities in the Argos Profits Interest Plan were as follows (in thousands, except per unit values):

**Years Ended**

Unvested at end of period ......................... 137 $ 247.22 285 $ 193.79 280 $ 60.70

During the year ended February 2, 2020, 84,292 Argos Profits Interest Units were canceled and exchanged
for Tracking Units as discussed below. As of February 2, 2020, the total unrecognized equity compensation expense
related to unvested Argos Profits Interest Units, net of estimated forfeitures, was $15.4 million and is expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.

We estimate the fair value of the Argos Profits Interest Units issued using a Black-Scholes model (Level 3
inputs). Expected volatilities are based on historical implied stock price volatilities of comparable companies. The
expected life of the equity interests granted is based on management’s estimates and represents the period of time we
expect the equity awards to be outstanding. The risk-free rates for the periods within the expected term of the equity

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

interests are based on the United States Treasury yield in effect at the time of the equity grant using the expected life
of the option. Argos Profits Interest Units are amortized using the graded amortization method over the vesting period,
net of estimated forfeitures. Actual values of grants could vary significantly from the results of the calculations. The
following assumptions were used to value the Argos Profits Interest Units:

**Years Ended**
**February 2,** **February 3,** **January 28,**

**2020** **2019** **2018**

**(52-weeks)** **(53-weeks)** **(52-weeks)**

_Citrus Profits Interest Plan_

Subsequent to the Chewy Acquisition, Citrus Intermediate Holdings L.P. (the “Citrus Partnership”), an
affiliate of the Argos Partnership, granted profits interest units to certain employees of Chewy under the Citrus Profits
Interest Plan (“Citrus Profits Interest Units”). These grants were subject to the terms of the limited partnership
agreement of the Citrus Partnership. The grants were non-transferable and were subject to forfeiture and repurchase
under certain conditions. The Citrus Partnership ceased issuing Citrus Profits Interest Units at the time of the Chewy
IPO and in connection with the adoption of the Chewy 2019 Plan.

Citrus Profits Interest Units were generally subject to time-based vesting with 20% vested after one year of
service and 1.667% per month thereafter with full vesting occurring upon five years of service.

Activities in the Citrus Profits Interest Plan were as follows (in thousands, except per unit values):

**Years Ended**

In addition to the activities discussed above, an aggregate of 794,814 Citrus Profits Interest Units held by
employees of Chewy, Inc. and its affiliates were canceled as of June 13, 2019.

We estimated the fair value of the Citrus Profits Interest Units issued using the same method as the Argos
Profits Interest Units discussed above. The following assumptions were used to value the Citrus Profits Interest Units:

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

Hereafter, we refer to the Argos Profits Interest Plan and the Citrus Profits Interest Plan collectively as the
“Profits Interest Plans.”

**_Tracking Units_**

In connection with the Chewy IPO, on June 13, 2019 (“Grant Date”), certain participants of the Argos Profits
Interest Plan exchanged 50% of their Argos Profit Interest Units into a specified number of tracking units (the
“Tracking Units”). Once exchanged, the participant has no further rights with respect to the applicable Argos Profit
Interest Units which were canceled. The Tracking Units awarded consist of Initial Award Units and Service Award
Units. The Initial Award Units vested upon the closing of the Chewy IPO whereas the Service Award Units vest over
four years with 25% of the Service Award Units vesting each year beginning on the first anniversary of the Grant
Date. The Tracking Units are transferable under certain conditions and unvested Service Award Units are subject to
forfeiture upon termination of employment. Once vested, each Tracking Unit may be settled indirectly with one share
of Chewy, Inc. Class A common stock (“Chewy Shares”), or cash equal to the closing price of an equivalent number
of Chewy Shares on the last trading day prior to the settlement date, at the option of the general partner of the Argos
Partnership.

The cancellation of the Argos Profit Interest Units accompanied by the concurrent grant of Tracking Units
are accounted for as replacement awards and modification of terms. No incremental compensation cost was recognized
related to the modification because the fair value on the cancellation date of the awards granted was less than the fair
value of the awards canceled. The unrecognized compensation cost of $0.5 million will be recognized over the new
remaining service period. During the year ended February 2, 2020, 716,838 Tracking Units were granted with a fair
value of $22.00 per unit which represents the offering price of Class A common stock in the Chewy IPO.

During the year ended February 2, 2020, the general partner of the Argos Partnership elected to indirectly
settle the Initial Award Units in cash. The cash settlement was equal to the closing price of the Chewy Shares on
December 10, 2019, the last trading day prior to the settlement date, of $25.50 per share for the 143,368 Initial Award
Units that had vested upon the closing of the Chewy IPO. PetSmart distributed a cash dividend of $3.7 million to our
parent, Argos Holdings, to fund the settlement of the Initial Award Units. As of February 2, 2020, 536,287 Service
Award Units were unvested and 37,183 Tracking Units had been forfeited.

**_Long-Term Incentive Award Program_**

During the year ended February 2, 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved a new cash based longterm incentive program primarily for certain eligible PetSmart employees that joined the Company after the Chewy
IPO (“LTIP Awards”). In addition to a service condition, the LTIP Awards contain a performance condition that is
fulfilled upon a change of control or IPO of the Company as defined in the individual LTIP Award agreements. The
final value payable upon satisfaction of the performance condition is based on the enterprise value of the Company,
less the value of any direct or indirect ownership in Chewy, Inc., implied by the change of control or IPO and varies
between a minimum and maximum payout amount based on such enterprise value. The LTIP Awards vest 20% after
each year of service with full vesting occurring upon the first to occur of five years of service or a change of control,
subject to an employee’s continued employment through such change of control. The LTIP Awards are nontransferable and are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions. The LTIP Awards expire if neither a change of
control nor an IPO occurs prior to January 1, 2025. The LTIP Awards are to be settled in cash, unless the board of
directors of the Company, at its sole discretion, elects that they be settled in securities of the Company or its affiliates.

As of February 2, 2020, no equity compensation expense had been recognized for outstanding LTIP Awards
due to the uncertainty of the occurrence of a change of control or an IPO of the Company prior to January 1, 2025.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control or IPO before January 1, 2025, the value of the LTIP Awards will be
calculated, as set forth in the LTIP Award agreements, based on the enterprise value implied by the change of control
or IPO. In the event of an IPO, a cumulative effect adjustment to equity compensation will be recognized for the period
of service provided and the unrecognized equity compensation expense, if any, will be recognized over the remaining
service period. In the event of a change of control, a cumulative effect adjustment to equity compensation will be
recognized for the entire value of the LTIP Awards. As of February 2, 2020, outstanding LTIP Awards would settle

units expense was deductible for tax purposes during the year ended February 2, 2020. Equity compensation for
Tracking Units and $23.4 million of profit interest units expense was not deductible for tax purposes during the year
ended February 2, 2020. Equity compensation for profits interest units was not deductible for tax purposes during the
years ended February 3, 2019 and January 28, 2018.

**Note 8 — Income Taxes**

The Company’s taxable income is included on the consolidated federal and state income tax returns of
Intermediate Holdco I. Due to the Chewy IPO, the Company is computing the components of its tax provision under
the parent-company-down approach. Under this approach, the Company’s consolidated financial statements receive a
pro-rata allocation of total current and deferred income tax expense from Intermediate Holdco I based on the
Company’s percentage of total consolidated pretax income.

In connection with Chewy’s IPO during 2019, the Company entered into a tax matters agreement with
Intermediate Holdco I, which provides, in part, for the allocation of income tax liabilities and the use of tax attributes.
As of February 2, 2020, there is no payment obligation between these two parties related to this agreement.

Of the $478.2 million in net deferred income tax liabilities, $2.2 million was classified as a deferred tax asset
within other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 2, 2020. Of the $436.7 million in
net deferred income tax liabilities, $2.5 million was classified as a deferred tax asset within other noncurrent assets on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 3, 2019.

As of February 2, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $21.1 million which
expire in varying amounts beginning in 2020. We also had state tax credit carryforwards of $2.4 million which expire
in varying amounts between 2020 and 2027.

The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after
establishing a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from
tax authorities. As of February 2, 2020, we believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized
tax benefits will decrease by approximately $10.0 million within the next 12 months due to the closing of tax audit
periods. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are not material to the consolidated financial
statements.

We have substantially settled all federal income tax matters through 2015, state and local jurisdictions
through 2010, and foreign jurisdictions through 2011. We could be subject to audits in these jurisdictions for the
subsequent years.

**Note 9 — Employee Benefit Plans**

We have defined contribution plans that cover all U.S. and Canadian employees that meet certain service
requirements (“Defined Contribution Plans”). Under the Defined Contribution Plans, we match employee
contributions, up to specified percentages of those contributions. We recognized expense related to matching
contributions of $15.6 million, $11.3 million, and $8.7 million for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019,
and January 28, 2018, respectively.

We also have a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (“Deferred Plan”). Under the Deferred Plan,
certain employees can elect to defer receipt of certain salary and cash bonus payments, but the plan does not allow for
employer matching.

**Note 10 — Financing Arrangements**

**_PetSmart ABL Facility_**

On March 11, 2015, in connection with the Argos Transaction, we entered into an asset-backed revolving
loan credit agreement that originally provided for a $750.0 million asset-backed revolving credit loan (the “PetSmart
ABL Facility”) with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, Barclays Bank PLC, as syndication agent, Natixis, New

F 31

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

York Branch, as co-manager, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as senior managing agent, and other lending
parties thereto.

The PetSmart ABL Facility originally provided for a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility of up
to $750.0 million, subject to a borrowing base, available in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars, with a letter of credit
sub-limit of $300.0 million and an accordion feature allowing us to increase the revolving commitment by up to $350.0
million subject to specified conditions. On May 15, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the PetSmart ABL
Facility (“ABL Amendment 1”). ABL Amendment 1 extended the maturity of $545.0 million of the PetSmart ABL
Facility and established an incremental commitment under the PetSmart ABL Facility’s accordion feature of $205.0
million (collectively, “Tranche 2”). The $750.0 million in total commitments of Tranche 2 matures on December 10,
2021. The remaining $205.0 million of the original PetSmart ABL Facility continued to mature on March 11, 2020
(“Tranche 1”). No other significant terms of the PetSmart ABL Facility were changed as a result of ABL Amendment
1. We incurred issuance costs of $3.5 million related to ABL Amendment 1.

On June 18, 2019, Tranche 1 of the PetSmart ABL Facility was terminated. Additionally, Chewy, Inc. and
its subsidiaries were released from their obligations under the PetSmart ABL Facility in accordance with its terms.
Accordingly, assets of Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries are no longer included in the borrowing base under the
PetSmart ABL Facility. The Company also entered into Amendment No. 2 to the PetSmart ABL Facility in order to,
among other things, permit Chewy, Inc. and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries to enter into its own asset-backed
credit facility.

Issuance costs are amortized over the life of the PetSmart ABL Facility using the straight-line method. The
unamortized portion of deferred issuance costs related to the PetSmart ABL Facility is presented in other noncurrent
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We wrote off $0.4 million of unamortized deferred issuance costs as a
result of the termination of Tranche 1, which is included in loss on extinguishment of debt on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the year ended February 2, 2020.

The PetSmart ABL Facility allows us to borrow various types of revolving loans that bear interest, at our
option, at LIBOR or a base rate, plus the Applicable Rate for U.S. borrowings, and the Canadian Prime Rate or the
Canadian BA Rate plus the Applicable Rate for Canadian borrowings. The Applicable Rate varies based on Average
Excess Liquidity and is defined as follows:

##### Adjusted Alternative Base LIBOR and Rate (ABR)
 Canadian  and Canadian

**Average Excess Liquidity** **BA Rate** **Prime Rate**

Category 1

Average Excess Liquidity <= 33.3% of the Total Maximum
Borrowing Amount ......................................................................... 1.75% 0.75%
Category 2

Average Excess Liquidity > 33.3%, but <= 66.6% of the Total
Maximum Borrowing Amount ........................................................ 1.50% 0.50%
Category 3

Average Excess Liquidity > 66.6% of the Total Maximum
Borrowing Amount ......................................................................... 1.25% 0.25%

We are subject to commitment fees on the unused portion of the PetSmart ABL Facility, payable quarterly
at an annual rate of 0.375% of the unused amount of the PetSmart ABL Facility when our average revolving loan
utilization is less than or equal to 50%, or 0.250% of the unused amount of the PetSmart ABL Facility when our
average revolving loan utilization is greater than 50%.

The PetSmart ABL Facility also gives us the ability to issue letters of credit, which reduce the amount
available under the PetSmart ABL Facility. Letters of credit issued under the PetSmart ABL Facility, either as U.S.

F 32


-----

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

letters of credit or Canadian letters of credit, are subject to participation fees payable quarterly at the Applicable Rate
for Adjusted LIBOR loans and fronting fees payable quarterly at a rate of 0.125%.

As of February 2, 2020, we had $63.0 million in outstanding letters of credit under the PetSmart ABL Facility
primarily issued for guarantees for insurance programs. We had no borrowings under the PetSmart ABL Facility as
of or for the years ended February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, or January 28, 2018. However, on March 18, 2020, after
the end of the fiscal year, we borrowed $300.0 million under the PetSmart ABL Facility.

**_Chewy ABL Facility_**

On June 18, 2019, Chewy, Inc. and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries entered into a new five-year
senior secured asset-backed credit facility (the “Chewy ABL Facility”). The Chewy ABL Facility provides for nonamortizing revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300.0 million, subject to a borrowing base
comprised of, among other things, inventory and sales receivables (subject to certain reserves). The Chewy ABL
Facility provides Chewy, Inc. the right to request incremental commitments and add incremental asset-based revolving
loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million, subject to customary conditions.

Borrowings under the Chewy ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Chewy, Inc.’s option,
either a base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is generally determined based on
the average excess liquidity during the immediately preceding fiscal quarter as a percentage of the maximum
borrowing amount under the Chewy ABL Facility and is between 0.25% and 0.75% for base rate loans and between
1.25% and 1.75% for LIBOR loans. Chewy, Inc. is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.375%
with respect to the undrawn portion of the commitments, which is generally based on average daily usage of the
facility.

Chewy, Inc. incurred $1.5 million of issuance costs related to the Chewy ABL Facility which are amortized
over the life of the Chewy ABL Facility using the straight-line method. The unamortized portion of deferred issuance
costs related to the Chewy ABL Facility is presented in other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We had no borrowings under the Chewy ABL Facility as of or during the year ended February 2, 2020.

**_Term Loan_**

On March 11, 2015, in connection with the Argos Transaction, we also entered into a seven-year credit
agreement (“Credit Agreement”) that provides for a senior secured term loan in the aggregate principal amount of
$4,300.0 million (the “Term Loan”) with Citibank, N.A., as administrative and collateral agent (the “Original Agent”),
Barclays Bank PLC, as syndication agent, Natixis, New York Branch, as co-manager, and other lending parties thereto.

The Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments until maturity in 2022 and allows for incremental
borrowings subject to a prescribed leverage ratio, pursuant to an accordion feature subject to certain restrictions.
Beginning in the year ended January 29, 2017, the Term Loan also requires additional annual principal payments from
our excess cash flow (as defined by the Credit Agreement) if we exceed a prescribed leverage ratio. No additional
principal payments were required as a result of our leverage ratio and excess cash flow level for the years ended
February 2, 2020, February 3, 2019, and January 28, 2018.

The Term Loan (other than Consenting Term Loans as defined below), as amended, accrued interest and
required periodic interest payments dependent on the type of borrowing, as follows:

**Borrowing Type** **Interest** **Interest Payments**
ABR

Borrowing ............................................ Alternative Base Rate plus 2.0% Quarterly

Equivalent to LIBOR interest

Eurocurrency Adjusted LIBOR, at our option, period elected, not to exceed

Borrowing ............................................ subject to 1% floor, plus 3.0% three months

F 33

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

On April 2, 2019, we received unconditional consents from Term Loan lenders holding loans representing
$3,861.3 million aggregate principal amount, or 93.3% (“Consenting Term Loans”), of Term Loans outstanding on
such date to Amendment No. 3 (“Amendment 3”) to the Term Loan Credit Agreement. On April 17, 2019, we entered
into Amendment 3, which increased the interest spread on Consenting Term Loans to 3.25% for ABR Borrowings
and 4.25% for Eurocurrency Borrowings.

The interest rate spread on Consenting Term Loans is subject to adjustments as described below.
The weighted-average interest rate on all borrowings under the Term Loan was 5.6% as of February 2, 2020.

Amendment 3 also amended the Term Loan Credit Agreement to require the Company to make prepayments
of Consenting Term Loans, at par, in an aggregate amount of $250.0 million within twelve months of the effective
date of Amendment 3. On June 21, 2019, we used a portion of the after-income tax net proceeds received from the
Chewy IPO to make a principal prepayment of Consenting Term Loans, at par, in an aggregate amount of
$625.0 million, which satisfied the prepayment requirement of Amendment 3. The prepayment was first applied to
the quarterly principal payments for Consenting Term Loans, and then to the maturity payment for Consenting Term
Loans. In accordance with Amendment 3, on June 21, 2019, upon satisfaction of the $250.0 million prepayment
requirement, the interest rate spread for Consenting Term Loans was reduced to 3.0% and 4.0% for ABR Borrowings
and Eurocurrency Borrowings, respectively. The interest rate spread on Consenting Term Loans can be further reduced
based on the Company meeting certain first lien leverage ratios as prescribed by Amendment 3. The interest spread
and quarterly principal payments for non-consenting Term Loan lenders did not change as a result of Amendment 3.

As the Term Loan was a loan syndication immediately before and after Amendment 3 and lenders
participated in both credit facilities, we evaluated the accounting for unamortized debt discounts and issuance fees
resulting from the original Term Loan and previous amendments, as well as additional costs paid for Amendment 3,
on a lender by lender basis. We paid consent fees to Consenting Term Loan lenders for Amendment 3 of $19.3 million,
or 0.5%, of the outstanding Consenting Term Loans balance, and $22.1 million of third-party costs incurred by lenders
in connection with Amendment 3. As Amendment 3 was treated as a modification of debt, rather than an
extinguishment of debt, for all syndicates, we did not write-off any of the unamortized debt discounts and issuance
fees resulting from the original Term Loan and previous amendments, and we capitalized and treated as additional
debt discounts the consent fees paid to lenders as well as the amounts paid by us for third-party costs incurred by
lenders. All other third-party costs in connection with Amendment 3 were expensed as incurred within operating,
general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the
year ended February 2, 2020.

The principal prepayment made to Consenting Term Loans on June 21, 2019 was treated as a partial
extinguishment of debt. As such, we wrote off $12.9 million of debt discounts and deferred issuance costs associated
with the portion of the Consenting Term Loans that were extinguished which is included in loss on extinguishment of
debt on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the year ended February 2, 2020.

Additionally, on January 6, 2020 and January 9, 2020, we used a portion of the after-income tax net proceeds
received from the Rule 144 Transactions to make principal prepayments of Consenting Term Loans, at par, in an
aggregate amount of $117.0 million and $73.0 million, respectively, which were treated as a partial extinguishment
of debt. As such, we wrote off $3.2 million of debt discounts and deferred issuance costs associated with the portion
of the Consenting Term Loans that were extinguished which is included in loss on extinguishment of debt on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the year ended February 2, 2020.

On February 10, 2020, after the end of the fiscal year, we used the remaining portion of the Additional Tender
Cap (defined below) that was not validly tendered by holders of our 5.875% senior first lien notes due 2025 to make
an additional principal prepayment of Consenting Term Loans, at par, in an aggregate amount of $58.6 million
(exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest). See additional discussion below under the heading “5.875% Senior First
Lien Notes due 2025.”

We amortize debt discounts and deferred issuance costs over the contractual term of the Term Loan using
the effective interest method. The Term Loan is presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of the unamortized
discounts and deferred issuance costs, in current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt, less current portion.

**_7.125% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2023_**

Also in connection with the Argos Transaction, on March 4, 2015, we issued $1,900.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of 7.125% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “7.125% Notes”). Interest payments for the 7.125%
Notes are due semi-annually on March 15th and September 15th. The 7.125% Notes mature on March 15, 2023. We
currently have the option to call the 7.125% Notes, or a portion thereof. Our ability to exercise the call option is limited
by certain restrictions under the Term Loan and PetSmart ABL Facility. If we were to exercise call options, we would
be required to pay the following redemption prices (stated in percentages of principal amount of the 7.125% Notes) if
redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on March 15th of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2020 ...................................................................................................................................... 101.781%
2021 and thereafter ............................................................................................................... 100.000%

We amortize discount and deferred issuance costs over the contractual term of the 7.125% Notes using the
effective interest method. The 7.125% Notes are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of the unamortized
discount and deferred issuance costs, in long-term debt, less current portion.

**_5.875% Senior First Lien Notes due 2025_**

In connection with the Chewy Acquisition, on May 31, 2017, we issued $1,350.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of 5.875% senior first lien notes due 2025 (the “5.875% Notes”). Interest payments for the 5.875%
Notes are due semi-annually on June 1st and December 1st, beginning December 1, 2017. The 5.875% Notes mature
on June 1, 2025. We have the option to call the 5.875% Notes, or a portion thereof, beginning in June 2020. Our ability
to exercise the call option is limited by certain restrictions under the Term Loan and PetSmart ABL Facility. If we
were to exercise the call options, we would be required to pay the following redemption prices (stated in percentages
of principal amount of the 5.875% Notes) if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on June 1st of each
of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2020 ...................................................................................................................................... 102.938%
2021 ...................................................................................................................................... 101.469%
2022 and thereafter ............................................................................................................... 100.000%

In addition, we may redeem the 5.875% Notes in whole or in part at any time prior to June 1, 2020 at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole premium” specified in the indenture governing the 5.875% Notes.

Additionally, prior to June 1, 2020, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5.875% Notes may
be redeemed at a redemption price equal to (i) 105.875% of the principal amount thereof, with an amount equal to or
less than the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
not including, the redemption date.

On July 3, 2019, we commenced a cash tender offer (the “Offer”) to purchase an aggregate principal amount
(exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest) of up to $205.0 million (the “Tender Cap”) of our outstanding 5.875%
Notes. The Offer, which expired on July 31, 2019, provided for the repurchase of the 5.875% Notes at $950 per $1,000
(95%) principal amount (“Offer Consideration”) using a portion of the after-income tax net proceeds from the Chewy
IPO. However, holders of the 5.875% Notes that validly tendered their 5.875% Notes for repurchase prior to July 17,
2019 (the “Early Tender Time”) were entitled to the Offer Consideration plus an early tender premium of $50 per
$1,000 (5%) principal amount, thus providing for total principal payment at par (“Total Consideration”).

As of the Early Tender Time, holders of the 5.875% Notes comprising $1,241.2 million principal amount, or
approximately 92%, of the $1,350.0 million principal amount of the 5.875% Notes, had validly tendered their 5.875%

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

Notes. As a result, the Tender Cap was considered fully subscribed at the Early Tender Time, and tendered 5.875%
Notes were entitled to a pro rata share of the Tender Cap at the Total Consideration, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The Tender Cap of $205.0 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, was paid to holders of the 5.875% Notes on July
19, 2019 and the repurchased 5.875% Notes were canceled. As a result, we wrote off $4.0 million of deferred issuance
fees associated with the portion of the 5.875% Notes being extinguished which is included in loss on extinguishment
of debt on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the year ended February 2,
2020.

On January 9, 2020, we commenced an additional cash tender offer (the “Additional Offer”) to purchase an
aggregate principal amount (exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest) of up to $62.0 million (“Additional Tender
Cap”) of our outstanding 5.875% Notes. The Additional Offer, which expired on February 6, 2020, provided for the
repurchase of the 5.875% Notes, at par, using a portion of the estimated after-income tax net proceeds received from
the Rule 144 Transactions. The principal amount of the 5.875% Notes that was validly tendered as of February 6,
2020 was $3.4 million. On February 10, 2020, after the end of the fiscal year, we paid holders of the 5.875% Notes
$3.4 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and the repurchased 5.875% Notes were canceled. The remaining
$58.6 million not validly tendered was used to make a prepayment of the Consenting Term Loans, at par, as discussed
above under the heading “Term Loan.” The repurchase of the 5.875% Notes and the principal prepayment of
Consenting Term Loans were both treated as partial extinguishments of debt.

We amortize discount and deferred issuance costs over the contractual term of the 5.875% Notes using the
effective interest method. The 5.875% Notes are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of the unamortized
discount and deferred issuance costs, in long-term debt, less current portion.

**_8.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025_**

In connection with the Chewy Acquisition, on May 31, 2017, we issued $650.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the “8.875% Notes”). Interest payments for the 8.875% Notes
are due semi-annually on June 1st and December 1st, beginning December 1, 2017. The 8.875% Notes mature on June
1, 2025. We have the option to call the 8.875% Notes, or a portion thereof, beginning in June 2020. Our ability to
exercise the call option is limited by certain restrictions under the Term Loan and PetSmart ABL Facility. If we were
to exercise call options, we would be required to pay the following redemption prices (stated in percentages of
principal amount of the 8.875% Notes) if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on June 1st of each of
the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2020 ...................................................................................................................................... 104.438%
2021 ...................................................................................................................................... 102.219%
2022 and thereafter ............................................................................................................... 100.000%

In addition, we may redeem the 8.875% Notes in whole or in part at any time prior to June 1, 2020 at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole premium” specified in the indenture governing the 8.875% Notes.

Additionally, prior to June 1, 2020, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 8.875% Notes may
be redeemed at a redemption price equal to (i) 108.875% of the principal amount thereof, with an amount equal to or
less than the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
not including, the redemption date.

We amortize discount and deferred issuance costs over the contractual term of the 8.875% Notes using the
effective interest method. The 8.875% Notes are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of the unamortized
discount and deferred issuance costs, in long-term debt, less current portion.

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

**_Guarantees and Security_**

On June 18, 2019, Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries were released from their obligations under the PetSmart
ABL Facility. As such, the PetSmart ABL Facility is currently secured by a first-priority security interest in PetSmart,
Inc. and its subsidiaries’ inventory and credit card receivables (excluding the assets of Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries
and our unrestricted subsidiaries), less reserves (the “PetSmart ABL Collateral”), and a second-priority security
interest in all of the other assets of the Company and its current subsidiaries (excluding the assets of Chewy, Inc. and
its subsidiaries and our unrestricted subsidiaries). As a result of the 20% dividend of the outstanding stock of Chewy,
Inc. on June 1, 2018 as discussed in Note 1, which caused Chewy, Inc. to no longer be a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PetSmart, Inc. Chewy, Inc.’s guarantee of the obligations under the Term Loan were automatically released and
terminated. The release and termination of Chewy, Inc.’s guarantee of the obligations under the Term Loan also caused
its guarantee under the indentures governing the senior notes to be released and terminated.

The Term Loan and the 5.875% Notes are secured by a first-priority security interest in all assets of PetSmart,
Inc. and its current subsidiaries (excluding the assets of Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries, the assets of our unrestricted
subsidiaries, and the PetSmart ABL Collateral) and a second-priority security interest in the PetSmart ABL Collateral
(which, after June 18, 2019, excludes the assets of Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries). The 7.125% Notes and the 8.875%
Notes are general unsecured obligations effectively subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future secured
debt to the extent of the value of collateral securing such secured debt, are equal in right of payment with all existing
and future senior debt, and senior in right of payment to any future subordinate debt.

All obligations under the Chewy ABL Facility are guaranteed on a senior secured first-lien basis by Chewy,
Inc.’s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and secured, subject to permitted liens and
other exceptions, by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all of Chewy, Inc.’s and its whollyowned domestic subsidiaries’ assets.

Following the completion of the dividend and contribution transactions involving common stock of Chewy,
Inc. on June 1, 2018 as described in Note 1 (collectively, the “Transactions”), the Original Agent under the Term Loan
did not comply with the Company’s request to evidence the release and termination of certain guarantees and security
interests as a result of the Transactions. On June 26, 2018, we commenced an action against the Original Agent in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Action”). The Action requested a judgment,
among other things, directing the Original Agent to perform its obligations under the Term Loan, including the
execution and delivery of all documents necessary to evidence the release and termination of the Chewy, Inc.
guarantees and security interests, and declaring that no event of default occurred under the Term Loan as a result of
the Transactions. On August 16, 2018, we entered into an Agency Assignment Agreement in which the Original Agent
resigned as administrative and collateral agent under the Term Loan, and Wilmington Trust, National Association was
assigned as the successor administrative and collateral agent (“Successor Agent”). Simultaneously, the Successor
Agent was substituted for the Original Agent in the Action. On September 6, 2018, the Successor Agent filed its
answer to our complaint, together with a number of counterclaims against the Company and certain of its affiliates,
challenging the Transactions.

As previously discussed, on April 17, 2019, we entered into Amendment 3 to the Term Loan Credit
Agreement. Amendment 3 provided for, among other things, a direction from Consenting Term Loan lenders to the
Successor Agent to settle the Action. In exchange, Amendment 3 amended the Term Loan Credit Agreement to tighten
certain restrictive covenants, and improve certain economic terms for Consenting Term Loans, including an increase
in the applicable interest rate spread for Consenting Term Loans, requiring that the Company pay a consent fee to
Consenting Term Loan lenders, and requiring that the Company prepay Consenting Term Loans within twelve months
of the effective date of Amendment 3, at par, in an aggregate amount of at least $250.0 million. As discussed above,
the Consenting Term Loans prepayment requirement was satisfied with our principal prepayment of $625.0 million
of Consenting Term Loans made on June 21, 2019.

Also on April 17, 2019, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the “Settlement
Agreement”), which caused the provisions of Amendment 3 to become effective. Upon the effective date of the
Settlement Agreement and Amendment 3, (1) the Successor Agent was directed to (a) withdraw and dismiss, with
prejudice, any causes of action alleged in its answer and counterclaim in the Action and (b) evidence the release and

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

termination of the applicable guarantees and security interests as a result of the Transactions and (2) each consenting
lender (a) acknowledged and agreed that the Transactions were permitted under the Term Loan Credit Agreement,
(b) ratified the Transactions, and (c) provided customary releases with respect to the Transactions.

On April 17, 2019, a Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal was filed dismissing the Action as well as the
counterclaims asserted by the Successor Agent against the Company and certain of its affiliates.

**_Representations, Warranties, Covenants, and Restricted/Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The PetSmart ABL Facility, the Chewy ABL Facility, the Term Loan, the 7.125% Notes, the 5.875% Notes,
and the 8.875% Notes (collectively referred to as “Credit Facilities”) contain customary representations, warranties,
affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default and cross-default. The negative covenants include
restrictions on our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, make
investments, give guarantees, sell assets, merge, or consolidate. Under the PetSmart ABL Facility and the Term Loan,
we are subject to financial covenants, including certain leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios, and fixed charges
coverage ratios. These financial covenant ratios are only applicable in the event of future material events of the
Company. In addition, the Chewy ABL Facility requires Chewy, Inc. to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage
ratio depending on the excess availability under the facility. We were in compliance with all covenants as of February
2, 2020.

Chewy, Inc. remains a restricted subsidiary under the agreements governing the PetSmart ABL Facility and
the Term Loan as well as the indentures governing PetSmart, Inc.’s senior notes. Two of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, one of which holds 100% ownership of the other subsidiary, the sole asset of which is its ownership of
16.2% of the outstanding common stock of Chewy, Inc., are unrestricted subsidiaries under the credit agreements and
the indentures governing PetSmart, Inc.’s senior notes. The unrestricted subsidiary accounts for its ownership of
16.2% of the outstanding common stock of Chewy, Inc. using the equity method of accounting.

**Note 11 — Leases**

We lease the vast majority of our stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and
corporate offices under noncancelable operating and finance leases. The terms of our real estate leases generally range
from 10 to 20 years and typically allow us to renew for up to four additional five-year terms. Store leases, including
exercised renewal options, expire at various dates through 2033. Distribution and fulfillment center, customer service
center, and corporate office leases, including exercised renewal options, expire at various dates through 2032.
Generally, our real estate leases require us to pay variable lease costs of property taxes, utilities, common area
maintenance, and insurance. We also lease certain equipment under operating and finance leases.

Finance ROU assets are included in property and equipment, net, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and,
net of accumulated depreciation, were $262.5 million as of February 2, 2020.

The following table provides details of lease costs recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations

The rental commitments schedule above includes all locations for which we had the right to control the use
of the property and includes open stores, closed stores, stores to be opened in the future, distribution and fulfillment
centers, customer service centers, and corporate offices. In addition to the commitments scheduled above, we had
executed lease agreements with total minimum lease payments of $200.3 million as of February 2, 2020. The typical
lease term for these agreements is 10 years. We did not have the right to control the use of the property and equipment
under these leases as of February 2, 2020 because we had not taken physical possession of the property and equipment.

Future fixed annual rental commitments were not reduced by amounts expected to be received from
subtenants. Subtenants primarily consist of third-party veterinary offices located within many of our stores. As of
February 2, 2020, the future annual payments expected to be collected from subtenants were as follows (in thousands):

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

**Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Advertising Purchase Commitments_**

As of February 2, 2020, we had obligations to purchase $30.0 million of advertising in fiscal year 2020 and
$5.7 million in fiscal year 2021.

**_Product and Services Purchase Commitments_**

As of February 2, 2020, we had various commitments to purchase merchandise and services from certain
vendors, including $28.9 million in fiscal year 2020, $20.3 million in fiscal year 2021, $9.2 million in fiscal year 2022,
$6.0 million in fiscal year 2023, and $1.2 million in fiscal year 2024.

**_Sales Tax Liability_**

The Company collects and remits sales tax in jurisdictions in which it has a physical presence or it believes
nexus exists. The Company continually evaluates whether it may have nexus in new jurisdictions with respect to sales
tax. The Company has recorded an estimated liability for potential exposure in states where there is uncertainty about
the point in time at which the Company established a sufficient in-state business presence to create nexus and the
Company did not collect sales tax. Changes in management’s assumptions may occur in the future as the Company
obtains new information, which can result in adjustments to the recorded liability. Increases and decreases to the
liability for uncollected sales tax are included in operating, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

**_Litigation and Settlements_**

In the normal course of our business, we are subject to actual and threatened legal actions and proceedings,
including those related to alleged violations of labor and employment laws, intellectual property rights, consumer
protection laws, premises liability, contract disputes, and other laws and regulations.

While we currently do not expect that the ultimate outcome of the proceedings and claims pending or
threatened against us will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, the outcome of any
litigation is inherently uncertain, and if decided adversely to us, or if we determine that settlement of particular
litigation is appropriate, we may be subject to liability that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for a particular period.

**Note 13 — Subsequent Events**

The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through April 6, 2020, the date
at which the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued (“Filing Date”), and determined the
following items required additional disclosure.

As discussed in Note 10, on February 10, 2020, we repurchased $3.4 million of our 5.875% Notes and made
an additional principal prepayment of $58.6 million toward Consenting Term Loans.

On March 11, 2020, the recent outbreak of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, was declared a global pandemic
by the World Health Organization, which has led to volatile impacts on the U.S. and global economies. While the petrelated industry continues to be viewed as essential, the pandemic has created uncertainty regarding potential impacts
to our supply chain, operations, and customer demand. The pandemic has impacted and could further impact our
operations and the operations of our suppliers and vendors as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and
logistics restrictions.

F 41

**PetSmart, Inc. and Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

As a result of the uncertainty of this pandemic, the Company took precautionary action to enhance our
financial flexibility. As discussed in Note 10, on March 18, 2020, we borrowed $300.0 million under the PetSmart
ABL Facility.

Effective March 21, 2020, we elected to temporarily suspend all grooming services and temporarily restricted
most training services for a period of approximately two weeks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 6,
2020, following an evaluation of our grooming business and several changes to our processes, we reopened our
grooming operations in the majority of our markets. We have continued to restrict pet training services to one-on-one
programs. The majority of our PetsHotels remained open as these provide essential services for many of our customers.
As of the Filing Date, the vast majority of our stores remained open in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. However,
we reduced hours of operation for all of our stores.

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted.
This law has far reaching implications to businesses including PetSmart. The Company has not yet estimated the law’s
impact to the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in fiscal year 2020.

**Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**

(Unaudited)

**Note 1 — The Company and Basis of Presentation**

**_Business_**

PetSmart, Inc., including its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries that we control (herein
collectively referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us,” unless the context requires otherwise), is a leading
specialty provider of products, services and solutions for the lifetime needs of pets. We offer a broad assortment of
products for all the life stages of pets, as well as various services, including professional grooming and boarding for
cats and dogs, and training and day camp for dogs. We also offer pet products through our e-commerce websites
(PetSmart.com, Chewy.com and OnlyNaturalPet.com) and maintain the content site PetMD.com. As of November 1,
2020, we operated 1,650 stores and had full-service veterinary hospitals, owned and operated by third-parties, in 809
of our stores.

On March 11, 2015 (“Transaction Date”), PetSmart, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Argos
Holdings Inc. (“Argos Holdings”). Argos Holdings is indirectly controlled by Argos Intermediate Holdco I Inc.
(“Intermediate Holdco I”), which is directly controlled by a consortium including funds advised by BC Partners, Inc.,
La Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, affiliates of GIC Special Investments Pte Ltd, affiliates of StepStone
Group LP, and Longview Asset Management, LLC (collectively, the “Sponsors”). Argos Holdings has no operating
activity, and its sole asset is its 100% ownership of PetSmart, Inc.

The Company pays an aggregate of $4.0 million in annual management fees to select Sponsors, which are
related parties, under a service agreement entered into with the Sponsors on the Transaction Date, which are recorded
in operating, general, and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss. The Company is subject to a termination fee under the services agreement equal to the net
present value of the annual management fees that would have been payable with respect to the period from the
termination date through the twelfth (12th) anniversary of the Transaction Date, or, if terminated following the twelfth
(12th) anniversary of the Transaction Date, through the first anniversary of the Transaction Date occurring after the
termination date.

On May 31, 2017, the Company closed on the acquisition of Chewy, Inc. (“Chewy Acquisition”). On June
1, 2018, the board of directors of PetSmart, Inc. declared and made a dividend in the form of 20.0% of the outstanding
common stock of Chewy, Inc. to its parent company, Argos Holdings. Also, on June 1, 2018, the board of directors
of Argos Holdings declared and made a dividend of this Chewy, Inc. common stock to its parent company. Separately,
on June 1, 2018, PetSmart, Inc. invested 16.5% of the outstanding common stock of Chewy, Inc. in the form of a
capital contribution to a wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. These transactions were each
approved by special committees of disinterested directors of PetSmart and Argos Holdings, as applicable, each of
which was advised by its own legal and financial advisors.

On June 18, 2019, Chewy, Inc. completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of shares of Class A common
stock. A wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. sold 47,875,000 shares at $22.00 per share, including 6,975,000
shares sold upon exercise by the underwriters of the IPO of their option to purchase additional shares (“Shares Sold”).
The Company received net proceeds of $1,000.6 million from the sale of these shares after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions of $52.7 million. In addition, Chewy, Inc. sold 5,600,000 shares (“New Shares”) in the
IPO at $22.00 per share. Chewy, Inc. received net proceeds of $117.0 million from the New Shares after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.2 million.

Prior to completion of the IPO, Chewy, Inc.’s outstanding common stock was reclassified into Class B
common stock. The rights of the holders of Chewy, Inc. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are
identical, except with respect to voting, conversion and transfer rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled
to one vote. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes and is convertible at any time (and upon the
occurrence of certain events) into one share of Class A common stock. We refer to the IPO of Chewy, Inc. which was
completed on June 18, 2019 as the “Chewy IPO.”

On December 20, 2019, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. converted 6,352,546 shares of Chewy,
Inc. Class B common stock into Class A common stock and sold these shares at $27.95 per share pursuant to Rule

F 48


-----

**Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

(Unaudited)

144 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”). Subsequently, on January 6, 2020, the same wholly-owned subsidiary
of PetSmart, Inc. converted an additional 3,850,000 shares of Chewy, Inc. Class B common stock into Class A
common stock and sold these shares at $28.75 per share also pursuant to Rule 144 of the Act (collectively, the “Rule
144 Transactions”). The Company received net proceeds of $288.1 million from the Rule 144 Transactions after
deducting commissions and fees.

On May 8, 2020, in connection with the offering of Trust Securities (as defined and discussed in Note 7), a
wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiary of the Company converted 17,584,098 shares of Class B common stock of
Chewy, Inc. into Class A common stock of Chewy, Inc. On May 11, 2020, these shares of Class A common stock
were pledged by the wholly-owned unrestricted subsidiary of the Company to secure its obligations under the Forward
Contract (as defined and discussed in Note 7).

On September 21, 2020, Chewy, Inc. issued and sold 5,100,000 shares of Class A common stock in an
underwritten public offering at a price of $54.40 per share to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, who acted as sole
underwriter in the offering. Chewy, Inc. had granted the underwriter an option to purchase up to an additional 765,000
shares of Class A common stock at a price of $54.40 per share (“Option Shares”), which was exercised on September
30, 2020. Chewy, Inc. raised $318.4 million in net proceeds through the equity offering (including proceeds from the
sale of the Option Shares) after deducting offering costs of approximately $0.6 million (herein collectively referred to
as the “Chewy Offering”), which resulted in an increase to additional paid-in capital during the thirteen weeks ended
November 1, 2020. We also recorded a decrease to additional paid-in capital during the thirteen weeks ended
November 1, 2020 as a result of adjusting our noncontrolling interests as discussed below.

As of November 1, 2020, as a result of the Chewy IPO, the Rule 144 Transactions, the vesting of restricted
stock units under the Chewy Omnibus Incentive Plan (refer to Note 4), the conversion of certain Class B common
stock to Class A common stock of Chewy, Inc., and the Chewy Offering discussed above, the Company, through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, owned 17,584,098 shares of Chewy, Inc. Class A common stock and 238,738,356 shares
of Chewy, Inc. Class B common stock, which represented 62.2% of the total outstanding shares of Chewy, Inc.
common stock. This included 4.3% in Class A common stock of Chewy, Inc. owned by Buddy Chester Sub LLC, a
wholly-owned, unrestricted subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc., 11.5% in Class B common stock of Chewy, Inc. owned by
Buddy Chester Corp., a wholly-owned, unrestricted subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc., and 46.4% in Class B common stock
of Chewy, Inc. owned by PetSmart Buddy Holdings Corp., a wholly-owned, restricted subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc.
Our Sponsors own an additional 19.0% in Class B common stock of Chewy, Inc., which is held by an entity outside
of the Company, and the remaining 18.8% is Class A common stock owned primarily by third-party investors. As of
November 1, 2020, the shares owned by wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company represented 73.6% of the
combined voting power of Chewy, Inc. common stock, and therefore, we continue to consolidate the financial results
of Chewy, Inc.

**_Basis of Presentation_**

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim reporting.
Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for annual financial statements.
In our opinion, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a
normal, recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the interim periods presented. These unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and
notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020.

Due to the seasonal nature of our business and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of
operations for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results
expected for the full year. Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the Sunday nearest to January 31st.
Fiscal year 2020 ends on January 31, 2021 and fiscal year 2019 ended on February 2, 2020. Each of these fiscal years
are 52-weeks. Unless otherwise specified, all references to years in these condensed consolidated financial statements
are to fiscal years.

**_Principles of Consolidation_**

Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its whollyowned and majority-owned subsidiaries that we control. We have eliminated all intercompany accounts and
transactions.

**_Noncontrolling Interests_**

Noncontrolling interests in our condensed consolidated financial statements represents the percentage of
ownership interests in Chewy, Inc. held by parties outside of PetSmart, Inc. Changes in the ownership interest in
Chewy, Inc. that do not cause the Company to lose its controlling interest of Chewy, Inc. are accounted for as equity
transactions which adjust noncontrolling interests and additional paid-in capital. During the thirty-nine weeks ended
November 1, 2020, we decreased additional paid-in capital for adjustments to noncontrolling interests of $188.6
million as detailed below (in thousands):

**Thirty-Nine Weeks**

**November 1, 2020**
New Shares ............................................................................................................................ $ 23,341

Chewy Offering ..................................................................................................................... 145,292
Other adjustments .................................................................................................................. 15,279

Increase to noncontrolling interests ....................................................................................... $ 188,623

**Note 2 — Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements**

There were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted that we believe
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

**Note 3 — Intangible Assets**

Intangible assets determined to be indefinite-lived consisted of trade names and were $2,380.0 million as of
November 1, 2020, February 2, 2020, and November 3, 2019, respectively.

Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Definitelived intangible assets were as follows (in thousands):

**November 1, 2020** **February 2, 2020** **November 3, 2019**
Trade names, trademarks, and domain

Definite-lived intangible assets, net ........ $ 309,675 $ 336,350 $ 345,212

During the thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, we recognized $9.0 million of
amortization expense on definite-lived intangible assets. During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 and
November 3, 2019, we recognized $27.0 million of amortization expense on definite-lived intangible assets.

**Note 4 — Equity Compensation**

**_Chewy Omnibus Incentive Plan_**

In June 2019, Chewy, Inc.’s board of directors adopted and approved the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the
“Chewy 2019 Plan”). The Chewy 2019 Plan became effective on June 13, 2019 and provides for the issuance of up to
31,864,865 shares of Class A common stock. No awards may be granted under the Chewy 2019 Plan after June 2029.

The Chewy 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, including incentive stock options, non-qualified
stock options, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, stock payments, restricted stock units, performance shares, other
incentive awards, stock appreciation rights, and cash awards (collectively, the “Chewy Awards”). The Chewy Awards
may be granted to employees of Chewy, Inc., consultants, and directors, and the employees and consultants of Chewy,
Inc.’s affiliates and subsidiaries.

_Service and Performance-Based Awards_

Beginning in June 2019, Chewy, Inc. granted restricted stock units that vest upon satisfaction of both a
service-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition (“PRSUs”) as described below.

The service-based vesting condition was or will be satisfied with respect to 25% of an employee’s PRSUs on
either (i) the first anniversary of the registration date (as defined in the Chewy 2019 Plan) or (ii) the first anniversary
of the vesting commencement date, and will then be satisfied with respect to 12.5% of an employee’s PRSUs at the
end of each six month period thereafter, subject to the employee’s continued employment with Chewy, Inc. through
the applicable vesting date.

The performance-based vesting condition shall be satisfied with respect to a percentage of an employee’s
PRSUs, as and when the price per share of Class A common stock specified is achieved, on a volume adjusted
weighted-average basis, on every trading day during a consecutive 45-trading day period completed prior to the fifth
anniversary of the Chewy 2019 Plan’s effective date subject to the employee’s continued employment with Chewy,
Inc. through the applicable vesting date. As of June 13, 2020, the performance-based vesting condition was fully
satisfied.

_Service-Based Awards_

During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, Chewy, Inc. granted restricted stock units with a
service-based vesting condition (“RSUs”). The service-based vesting condition for employees will be satisfied with
respect to 25% of an employee’s RSUs on the one-year anniversary of the vesting commencement date and 12.5% of
an employee’s RSUs at the end of each six month period thereafter, subject to the employee’s continued employment
with Chewy, Inc. through the applicable vesting date.

_Service and Performance-Based Awards Activity_

The following table summarizes the activity related to the PRSUs under the Chewy 2019 Plan for the thirtynine weeks ended November 1, 2020, (in thousands, except for weighted-average grant date fair value):

**Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**

**November 1, 2020**

**Weighted-**

**Number of** **Average Grant**

**PRSUs** **Date Fair Value**

Unvested at beginning of period............................................................... 21,284 $ 36.20
Granted ................................................................................................. 805 $ 32.30
Vested ................................................................................................... (5,389) $ 36.37
Forfeited ............................................................................................... (959) $ 34.86
Unvested at end of period 15,741 $ 36.03


The total fair value of PRSUs that vested during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 was $577.3
million. As of November 1, 2020, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested PRSUs was $106.9
million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average performance period of 1.8 years.

The fair value of the PRSUs with share price hurdles was determined on the date of grant using a Monte
Carlo model to simulate total stockholder return for Chewy, Inc. and peer companies with the following assumptions:

Performance period ...................................................................................................................... 5 years
Weighted-average risk-free interest rate....................................................................................... 1.8%
Weighted-average volatility ......................................................................................................... 49.7%
Weighted-average dividend yield ................................................................................................. —%

The risk-free interest rate utilized is based on a 5-year term-matched zero-coupon U.S. Treasury security
yield at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the stock of Chewy, Inc.’s peer firms.

_Service-Based Awards Activity_

The following table summarizes the activity related to Chewy, Inc.’s RSUs during the thirty-nine weeks
ended November 1, 2020 (in thousands, except for weighted-average grant date fair value):

**Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**

**November 1, 2020**

**Weighted-**

**Number of** **Average Grant**

**RSUs** **Date Fair Value**

Unvested at beginning of period............................................................... — $ —
Granted ................................................................................................. 674 $ 42.85
Forfeited ............................................................................................... (25) $ 39.20
Unvested at end of period ......................................................................... 649 $ 42.85


As of November 1, 2020, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $24.2
million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average performance period of 3.5 years. The fair value for
RSUs is established based on the market price of Chewy, Inc.’s Class A common stock on the date of grant. As of
November 1, 2020, there were 7.3 million additional shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance
under the Chewy 2019 Plan.

**_Profits Interest Plans_**

_Argos Profits Interest Plan_

Argos Holdings L.P. (the “Argos Partnership”), an indirect parent of Argos Holdings, granted equity interests
in the Argos Partnership to certain employees in the form of Special Class A-2 Units, which fully vested upon grant,
as well as profits interest units under the Argos Profits Interest Plan (“Argos Profits Interest Units”). These grants are
subject to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of the Argos Partnership. The grants are non-transferable and
are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions. In addition, the Argos Partnership has the right to repurchase all or
a portion of the vested equity interests after termination of a grantee’s employment.

Argos Profits Interest Units are generally subject to time-based vesting. These awards typically vest 20%
after one year of service and 1.667% per month thereafter with full vesting occurring upon five years of service. The
Argos Profits Interest Plan expires in 2025. During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, the Argos
Partnership granted 49,251 Argos Profits Interest Units. There were no Argos Profits Interest Units granted during the
thirteen weeks ended November 1, 2020. We do not expect the Argos Partnership to grant additional Argos Profits
Interest Units in the future.

There were no Argos Profits Interest Units granted during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended
November 3, 2019. During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019, 84,292 Argos Profits Interest Units were
canceled and exchanged for tracking units as discussed below.

_Citrus Profits Interest Plan_

Subsequent to the Chewy Acquisition, Citrus Intermediate Holdings L.P. (the “Citrus Partnership”), an
affiliate of the Argos Partnership, granted profits interest units to certain employees of Chewy under the Citrus Profits
Interest Plan (“Citrus Profits Interest Units”). These grants were subject to the terms of the limited partnership
agreement of the Citrus Partnership. The grants were non-transferable and were subject to forfeiture and repurchase
under certain conditions.

Citrus Profits Interest Units were generally subject to time-based vesting with 20% vested after one year of
service and 1.667% per month thereafter with full vesting occurring upon five years of service. During the thirty-nine
weeks ended November 3, 2019, prior to the Chewy IPO, the Citrus Partnership granted 228,435 Citrus Profits Interest
Units. There were no Citrus Profits Interest Units granted during the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2019. The
Citrus Partnership ceased issuing Citrus Profits Interest Units at the time of the Chewy IPO and in connection with
the adoption of the Chewy 2019 Plan.

**_Tracking Units_**

In connection with the Chewy IPO, on June 13, 2019 (“Grant Date”), certain participants of the Argos Profits
Interest Plan exchanged 50% of their Argos Profits Interest Units into a specified number of tracking units (the
“Tracking Units”). Once exchanged, the participant has no further rights with respect to the applicable Argos Profits
Interest Units which were canceled. The Tracking Units awarded consist of Initial Award Units and Service Award
Units. The Initial Award Units vested upon the closing of the Chewy IPO whereas the Service Award Units vest over
four years with 25% of the Service Award Units vesting each year beginning on the first anniversary of the Grant
Date. The Tracking Units are transferable under certain conditions and unvested Service Award Units are subject to
forfeiture upon termination of employment. Once vested, each Tracking Unit may be settled indirectly with one share
of Chewy, Inc. Class A common stock (“Chewy Shares”), or cash equal to the closing price of an equivalent number
of Chewy Shares on the last trading day prior to the settlement date, at the option of the general partner of the Argos
Partnership (“Argos General Partner”).

The cancellation of the Argos Profits Interest Units accompanied by the concurrent grant of Tracking Units
represented replacement awards and modification of terms and were initially accounted for as equity awards. No
incremental compensation cost was recognized related to the modification because the fair value on the cancellation
date of the awards granted was less than the fair value of the awards canceled. During the thirty-nine weeks ended

(Unaudited)

November 3, 2019, 716,838 Tracking Units were granted with a fair value of $22.00 per unit which represents the
offering price of Class A common stock in the Chewy IPO. There were no Tracking Units granted during the thirteen
weeks ended November 3, 2019.

During the thirteen weeks ended February 2, 2020, the Argos General Partner elected to settle the Initial
Award Units with cash. At that time, the Argos General Partner had not made a decision on the settlement option for
the Service Award Units. As such, the Service Award Units remained classified as equity awards as of February 2,
2020, and the compensation expense was recorded using the original grant date value of the canceled awards.

During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, the Argos General Partner elected to settle the first
tranche of the Service Award Units with cash. Based on the Argos General Partner’s historical decisions to settle the
Initial Award Units and the first tranche of the Service Award Units with cash, all of the Service Award Units were
reclassified as liability awards during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 and were recorded at fair market
value using the trading price of the Class A common stock of Chewy, Inc. as of the end of the period. During the
thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, the Company paid a cash dividend to our parent to settle the first tranche
of the Service Award Units.

**_Long-Term Incentive Award Program_**

In December 2019, the Company’s board of directors approved a new cash based long-term incentive
program primarily for certain eligible PetSmart employees that joined the Company after the Chewy IPO (“LTIP
Awards”). In addition to a service condition, the LTIP Awards contain a performance condition that is fulfilled upon
a change of control or IPO of the Company as defined in the individual LTIP Award agreements. The final value
payable upon satisfaction of the performance condition is based on the enterprise value of the Company, less the value
of any direct or indirect ownership in Chewy, Inc., implied by the change of control or IPO and varies between a
minimum and maximum payout amount based on such enterprise value. The LTIP Awards vest 20% after each year
of service with full vesting occurring upon the first to occur of five years of service or a change of control, subject to
an employee’s continued employment through such change of control. The LTIP Awards are non-transferable and are
subject to forfeiture under certain conditions. The LTIP Awards expire if neither a change of control nor an IPO occurs
prior to January 1, 2025. The LTIP Awards are to be settled in cash, unless the board of directors of the Company, at
its sole discretion, elects that they be settled in securities of the Company or its affiliates.

There was no equity compensation expense recognized for outstanding LTIP Awards as of or during the
thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020 due to the uncertainty of the occurrence of a change of control or an IPO
of the Company prior to January 1, 2025. Upon the occurrence of a change of control or IPO before January 1, 2025,
the value of the LTIP Awards will be calculated, as set forth in the LTIP Award agreements, based on the enterprise
value implied by the change of control or IPO. In the event of an IPO, a cumulative effect adjustment to equity
compensation will be recognized for the period of service provided and the unrecognized equity compensation
expense, if any, will be recognized over the remaining service period. In the event of a change of control, a cumulative
effect adjustment to equity compensation will be recognized for the entire value of the LTIP Awards. As of
November 1, 2020, outstanding LTIP Awards would settle between a total of $6.3 million and $31.7 million
depending on the enterprise value implied by a change of control or IPO and assuming all service conditions had been
met in the case of an IPO.

**_Equity Compensation Expense_**

Equity compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line method with respect to the RSUs and the
graded amortization method for PRSUs, profits interest units, and Tracking Units. The Company recognized equity
compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, as follows (in thousands):

**Thirteen Weeks Ended** **Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**
**November 1,** **November 3,** **November 1,** **November 3,**

**2020** **2019** **2020** **2019**

PRSUs ............................................................... $ 22,886 $ 40,185 $ 98,393 $ 62,630
RSUs ................................................................. 2,345 — 3,576 —
Profits interest units ........................................... 4,801 4,530 33,978 34,940
Tracking Units ................................................... 3,392 119 15,600 419

Total equity compensation expense ................... $ 33,424 $ 44,834 $ 151,547 $ 97,989

**Note 5 — Income Taxes**

At the end of each interim period, we estimate the annual effective tax rate and apply that rate to our quarterly
earnings. The tax expense or benefit related to significant, unusual, or extraordinary items is recognized in the interim
period in which those items occur. In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws, rates, or tax status is
recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision
for income taxes may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained, or the tax environment changes.

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted.
The CARES Act includes numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes
regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses, temporary changes to the prior and future limitations
on interest deductions, temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer’s portion of Social
Security taxes, technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax depreciation of certain qualified improvement
property and net operating losses, and the creation of certain refundable employee retention credits. The Company
continues to assess the impact of these new tax provisions but has preliminarily recorded income tax benefits of $7.4
million and a deferral of the employer’s portion of Social Security taxes of $72.4 million, which can be paid back in
two equal installments on December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, if not paid back earlier.

In connection with the Forward Contract (defined and discussed in Note 7), we determined during the thirteen
weeks ended November 1, 2020 that Chewy, Inc. will no longer be included in the consolidated federal income tax
return of the Company for fiscal year 2020.

**Note 6— Financing Arrangements**

**_PetSmart ABL Facility_**

On March 11, 2015, we entered into an asset-backed revolving loan credit agreement (the “PetSmart ABL
Facility”) with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, Barclays Bank PLC, as syndication agent, Natixis, New York
Branch, as co-manager, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as senior managing agent, and other lending parties
thereto.

The PetSmart ABL Facility originally provided for a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility of up
to $750.0 million, subject to a borrowing base, available in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars, with a letter of credit
sub-limit of $300.0 million and an accordion feature allowing us to increase the revolving commitment by up to $350.0
million subject to specified conditions. On May 15, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the PetSmart ABL
Facility (“ABL Amendment 1”). ABL Amendment 1 extended the maturity of $545.0 million of the PetSmart ABL
Facility and established an incremental commitment under the PetSmart ABL Facility’s accordion feature of $205.0
million (collectively, “Tranche 2”). The $750.0 million in total commitments of Tranche 2 matures on December 10,
2021. The remaining $205.0 million of the original PetSmart ABL Facility matured on March 11, 2020 (“Tranche 1”).
No other significant terms of the PetSmart ABL Facility were changed as a result of ABL Amendment 1.

**Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

(Unaudited)

On June 18, 2019, Tranche 1 of the PetSmart ABL Facility was terminated. Additionally, Chewy, Inc. and
its subsidiaries were released from their obligations under the PetSmart ABL Facility in accordance with its terms.
Accordingly, assets of Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries are no longer included in the borrowing base under the
PetSmart ABL Facility. The Company also entered into Amendment No. 2 to the PetSmart ABL Facility in order to,
among other things, permit Chewy, Inc. and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries to enter into its own asset-backed
credit facility.

The PetSmart ABL Facility allows us to borrow various types of revolving loans that bear interest, at our
option, at LIBOR or a base rate, plus the Applicable Rate for U.S. borrowings, and the Canadian Prime Rate or the
Canadian BA Rate plus the Applicable Rate for Canadian borrowings. Interest payments are due based on the LIBOR
interest period elected but not to exceed three months. The Applicable Rate varies based on Average Excess Liquidity
and is defined as follows:

**Alternative Base**

**Adjusted LIBOR** **Rate (ABR) and**
**and Canadian BA** **Canadian Prime**

**Average Excess Liquidity** **Rate** **Rate**

**Category 1**

Average Excess Liquidity <= 33.3% of the Total Maximum
Borrowing Amount ...................................................................... 1.75% 0.75%
**Category 2**

Average Excess Liquidity > 33.3%, but <= 66.6% of the Total
Maximum Borrowing Amount .................................................... 1.50% 0.50%
**Category 3**

Average Excess Liquidity > 66.6% of the Total Maximum
Borrowing Amount ...................................................................... 1.25% 0.25%

We are subject to commitment fees on the unused portion of the PetSmart ABL Facility, payable quarterly
at an annual rate of 0.375% of the unused amount of the PetSmart ABL Facility when our average revolving loan
utilization is less than or equal to 50%, or 0.250% of the unused amount of the PetSmart ABL Facility when our
average revolving loan utilization is greater than 50%.

The PetSmart ABL Facility also gives us the ability to issue letters of credit, which reduce the amount
available under the PetSmart ABL Facility. Letters of credit issued under the PetSmart ABL Facility, either as U.S.
letters of credit or Canadian letters of credit, are subject to participation fees payable quarterly at the Applicable Rate
for Adjusted LIBOR loans and fronting fees payable quarterly at a rate of 0.125%. As of November 1, 2020, we had
$62.0 million in outstanding letters of credit under the PetSmart ABL Facility primarily issued for guarantees for
insurance programs.

On March 18, 2020, we borrowed $300.0 million under the PetSmart ABL Facility (“March 2020 ABL
Draw”). The interest rate on the March 2020 ABL Draw was 2.1%. We repaid the March 2020 ABL Draw in full
during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020. We had no additional borrowings under the PetSmart ABL
Facility during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020. We had no borrowings under the PetSmart ABL
Facility as of or during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019.

Issuance costs are amortized over the life of the PetSmart ABL Facility using the straight-line method. The
unamortized portion of deferred issuance costs related to the PetSmart ABL Facility is presented in other noncurrent
assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We wrote off $0.4 million of unamortized deferred issuance
costs as a result of the termination of Tranche 1, which is included in loss on extinguishment of debt on our Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3,
2019.

**_Chewy ABL Facility_**

On June 18, 2019 Chewy, Inc. and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries entered into a new five-year senior
secured asset-backed credit facility (the “Chewy ABL Facility”). The Chewy ABL Facility provides for nonamortizing revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300.0 million, subject to a borrowing base
comprised of, among other things, inventory and sales receivables (subject to certain reserves). The Chewy ABL
Facility provides Chewy, Inc. the right to request incremental commitments and add incremental asset-based revolving
loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million, subject to customary conditions.

Borrowings under the Chewy ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Chewy, Inc.’s option,
either a base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is generally determined based on
the average excess liquidity during the immediately preceding fiscal quarter as a percentage of the maximum
borrowing amount under the Chewy ABL Facility and is between 0.25% and 0.75% for base rate loans and between
1.25% and 1.75% for LIBOR loans. Chewy, Inc. is required to a pay commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.375%
with respect to the undrawn portion of the commitments, which is generally based on average daily usage of the
facility.

Chewy, Inc. incurred $1.5 million of issuance costs related to the Chewy ABL Facility which are amortized
over the life of the Chewy ABL Facility using the straight-line method. The unamortized portion of deferred issuance
costs related to the Chewy ABL Facility is presented in other noncurrent assets on the Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

We had no borrowings under the Chewy ABL Facility as of or during the thirty-nine weeks ended November
1, 2020 or November 3, 2019.

**_Term Loan_**

On March 11, 2015, we entered into a seven-year credit agreement (“Term Loan Credit Agreement”) that
provides for a senior secured term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $4,300.0 million (the “Term Loan”) with
Citibank, N.A., as administrative and collateral agent (the “Original Agent”), Barclays Bank PLC, as syndication
agent, Natixis, New York Branch, as co-manager, and other lending parties thereto.

The Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments to non-Consenting Term Loans (defined below) until
maturity in 2022 and allows for incremental borrowings subject to a prescribed leverage ratio, pursuant to an accordion
feature subject to certain restrictions. Beginning in the year ended January 29, 2017, the Term Loan also requires
additional annual principal payments from our excess cash flow (as defined by the Term Loan Credit Agreement) if
we exceed a prescribed leverage ratio. No additional principal payments were required as a result of our leverage ratio
and excess cash flow level for the year ended February 2, 2020.

The Term Loan (other than Consenting Term Loans as defined below), as amended, accrued interest and
required periodic interest payments dependent on the type of borrowing, as follows:

**Borrowing Type** **Interest** **Interest Payments**


ABR Borrowing ............................................

Eurocurrency Borrowing ...............................


Alternative Base Rate plus

Quarterly
2.0%

Adjusted LIBOR, at our Equivalent to LIBOR interest
option, subject to 1% floor, period elected, not to exceed

plus 3.0% three months


On April 2, 2019, we received unconditional consents from Term Loan lenders holding loans representing
$3,861.3 million aggregate principal amount, or 93.3% (“Consenting Term Loans”), of Term Loans outstanding on
such date to Amendment No. 3 (“Amendment 3”) to the Term Loan Credit Agreement. On April 17, 2019, we entered
into Amendment 3, which increased the interest spread on Consenting Term Loans to 3.25% for ABR Borrowings
and 4.25% for Eurocurrency Borrowings.

F 57


-----

**Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

(Unaudited)

The interest rate spread on Consenting Term Loans is subject to adjustments as described below. The
weighted-average interest rate on all borrowings under the Term Loan was 4.5% as of November 1, 2020.

Amendment 3 also amended the Term Loan Credit Agreement to require the Company to make prepayments
of Consenting Term Loans, at par, in an aggregate amount of $250.0 million within twelve months of the effective
date of Amendment 3. On June 21, 2019, we used a portion of the after-income tax net proceeds received from the
Chewy IPO to make a principal prepayment of Consenting Term Loans, at par, in an aggregate amount of $625.0
million, which satisfied the prepayment requirement of Amendment 3. The prepayment was first applied to the
quarterly principal payments for Consenting Term Loans, and then to the maturity payment for Consenting Term
Loans. In accordance with Amendment 3, on June 21, 2019, upon satisfaction of the $250.0 million prepayment
requirement, the interest rate spread for Consenting Term Loans was reduced to 3.0% and 4.0% for ABR Borrowings
and Eurocurrency Borrowings, respectively. Effective September 30, 2020, the interest rate spread on Consenting
Term Loans was further reduced to 2.5% and 3.5% for ABR Borrowings and Eurocurrency Borrowings, respectively,
based on the Company meeting certain first lien leverage ratios as prescribed by Amendment 3. The interest spread
and quarterly principal payments for non-consenting Term Loan lenders did not change as a result of Amendment 3.

As the Term Loan was a loan syndication immediately before and after Amendment 3 and lenders
participated in both credit facilities, we evaluated the accounting for unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs
resulting from the original Term Loan and previous amendments, as well as additional costs paid for Amendment 3,
on a lender-by-lender basis. We paid consent fees to Consenting Term Loan lenders for Amendment 3 of $19.3 million,
or 0.5%, of the outstanding Consenting Term Loans balance, and $22.1 million of third-party costs incurred by lenders
in connection with Amendment 3. As Amendment 3 was treated as a modification of debt, rather than an
extinguishment of debt, for all syndicates, we did not write-off any of the unamortized debt discounts and issuance
costs resulting from the original Term Loan and previous amendments, and we capitalized and treated as additional
debt discounts the consent fees paid to lenders as well as the amounts paid by us for third-party costs incurred by
lenders. All other third-party costs in connection with Amendment 3 were expensed as incurred within operating,
general, and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Loss for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 3, 2019.

The principal prepayment made to Consenting Term Loans on June 21, 2019 was treated as a partial
extinguishment of debt. As such, we wrote off $12.9 million of debt discounts and deferred issuance costs associated
with the Consenting Term Loans being extinguished which is included in loss on extinguishment of debt on our
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the thirty-nine weeks ended
November 3, 2019.

Additionally, on January 6, 2020 and January 9, 2020, we used a portion of the after-income tax net proceeds
received from the Rule 144 Transactions to make principal prepayments of Consenting Term Loans, at par, in an
aggregate amount of $117.0 million and $73.0 million, respectively.

On February 10, 2020, we used the remaining portion of the Additional Tender Cap (defined below) that was
not validly tendered by holders of our 5.875% senior first lien notes due 2025 to make an additional principal
prepayment of Consenting Term Loans, at par, in an aggregate amount of $58.6 million (exclusive of accrued and
unpaid interest), which was treated as a partial extinguishment of debt. As such, we wrote off $0.9 million of debt
discounts and deferred issuance costs associated with the portion of the Consenting Term Loans that were extinguished
which was included in loss on extinguishment of debt on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020. See additional discussion below under
the heading “5.875% Senior First Lien Notes due 2025.”

On May 13, 2020, we used the net proceeds from the Forward Contract (defined and discussed in Note 7),
net of expenses, to make a principal prepayment of Consenting Term Loans, at par, in an aggregate amount of $534.0
million which was treated as a partial extinguishment of debt. As such, we wrote off $7.6 million of debt discounts
and deferred issuance costs associated with the portion of the Consenting Term Loans that were extinguished which
was included in loss on extinguishment of debt on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020.

(Unaudited)

On August 25, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 4 (“Amendment 4”) to the Term Loan Credit
Agreement after receiving unconditional consents from Term Loan lenders holding a majority of the aggregate
principal amount of Term Loans outstanding. Amendment 4 permits the Company to form additional unrestricted
subsidiaries as subsidiaries of our existing unrestricted subsidiaries in order to facilitate potential sales of, or contracts
to sell, Chewy, Inc. common stock that is already held by our existing unrestricted subsidiaries.

We amortize debt discounts and deferred issuance costs over the contractual term of the Term Loan using
the effective interest method. The Term Loan is presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of the
unamortized discounts and deferred issuance costs, in current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt, less
current portion.

**_7.125% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2023_**

On March 4, 2015, we issued $1,900.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.125% senior unsecured
notes due 2023 (the “7.125% Notes”). Interest payments for the 7.125% Notes are due semi-annually on March 15th
and September 15th. The 7.125% Notes mature on March 15, 2023. We currently have the option to call the 7.125%
Notes, or a portion thereof. Our ability to exercise the call option is limited by certain restrictions under the Term
Loan and PetSmart ABL Facility. If we were to exercise call options, we would be required to pay the following
redemption prices (stated in percentages of principal amount of the 7.125% Notes) if redeemed during the twelvemonth period beginning on March 15th of each of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2020 .............................................................................................................................................. 101.781%
2021 and thereafter ....................................................................................................................... 100.000%

We amortize discount and deferred issuance costs over the contractual term of the 7.125% Notes using the
effective interest method. The 7.125% Notes are presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of the
unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs, in long-term debt, less current portion.

**_5.875% Senior First Lien Notes due 2025_**

In connection with the Chewy Acquisition, on May 31, 2017, we issued $1,350.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of 5.875% senior first lien notes due 2025 (the “5.875% Notes”). Interest payments for the 5.875%
Notes are due semi-annually on June 1st and December 1st, beginning December 1, 2017. The 5.875% Notes mature
on June 1, 2025. We have the option to call the 5.875% Notes, or a portion thereof, beginning in June 2020. Our ability
to exercise the call option is limited by certain restrictions under the Term Loan and PetSmart ABL Facility. If we
were to exercise the call options, we would be required to pay the following redemption prices (stated in percentages
of principal amount of the 5.875% Notes) if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on June 1st of each
of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2020 ................................................................................................................................................ 102.938%
2021 ................................................................................................................................................ 101.469%
2022 and thereafter ......................................................................................................................... 100.000%

On July 3, 2019, we commenced a cash tender offer (the “Offer”) to purchase an aggregate principal amount
(exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest) of up to $205.0 million (the “Tender Cap”) of our outstanding 5.875%
Notes. The Offer, which expired on July 31, 2019, provided for the repurchase of the 5.875% Notes at $950 per $1,000
(95%) principal amount (“Offer Consideration”) using a portion of the after-income tax net proceeds from the Chewy
IPO. However, holders of the 5.875% Notes that validly tendered their 5.875% Notes for repurchase prior to July 17,
2019 (the “Early Tender Time”) were entitled to the Offer Consideration plus an early tender premium of $50 per
$1,000 (5%) principal amount, thus providing for total principal payment at par (“Total Consideration”).

**Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)**

(Unaudited)

As of the Early Tender Time, holders of the 5.875% Notes comprising $1,241.2 million principal amount, or
approximately 92%, of the $1,350.0 million principal balance of the 5.875% Notes, had validly tendered their 5.875%
Notes. As a result, the Tender Cap was considered fully subscribed at the Early Tender Time, and tendered 5.875%
Notes were entitled to a pro rata share of the Tender Cap at the Total Consideration, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The Tender Cap of $205.0 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, was paid to holders of the 5.875% Notes on July
19, 2019 and the repurchased 5.875% Notes were canceled. As a result, we wrote off $4.0 million of deferred issuance
fees associated with the portion of the 5.875% Notes being extinguished which is included in loss on extinguishment
of debt on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the thirty-nine
weeks ended November 3, 2019.

On January 9, 2020, we commenced an additional cash tender offer (the “Additional Offer”) to purchase an
aggregate principal amount (exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest) of up to $62.0 million (“Additional Tender
Cap”) of our outstanding 5.875% Notes. The Additional Offer, which expired on February 6, 2020, provided for the
repurchase of the 5.875% Notes, at par, using a portion of the estimated after-income tax net proceeds received from
the Rule 144 Transactions. The principal amount of the 5.875% Notes that was validly tendered as of February 6,
2020 was $3.4 million. On February 10, 2020, we paid holders of the 5.875% Notes $3.4 million, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, and the repurchased 5.875% Notes were canceled and treated as a partial extinguishment of debt. As
such, we wrote off $0.1 million of discount and deferred issuance costs associated with the portion of the 5.875%
Notes that were extinguished which was included in loss on extinguishment of debt on our Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020. The
remaining $58.6 million not validly tendered was used to make a prepayment of the Consenting Term Loans, at par,
as discussed above under the heading “Term Loan.”

We amortize discount and deferred issuance costs over the contractual term of the 5.875% Notes using the
effective interest method. The 5.875% Notes are presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of the
unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs, in long-term debt, less current portion.

**_8.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025_**

In connection with the Chewy Acquisition, on May 31, 2017, we issued $650.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the “8.875% Notes”). Interest payments for the 8.875% Notes
are due semi-annually on June 1st and December 1st, beginning December 1, 2017. The 8.875% Notes mature on June
1, 2025. We have the option to call the 8.875% Notes, or a portion thereof, beginning in June 2020. Our ability to
exercise the call option is limited by certain restrictions under the Term Loan and PetSmart ABL Facility. If we were
to exercise call options, we would be required to pay the following redemption prices (stated in percentages of
principal amount of the 8.875% Notes) if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on June 1st of each of
the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2020 ............................................................................................................................................ 104.438%
2021 ............................................................................................................................................ 102.219%
2022 and thereafter ..................................................................................................................... 100.000%

We amortize discount and deferred issuance costs over the contractual term of the 8.875% Notes using the
effective interest method. The 8.875% Notes are presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of the
unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs, in long-term debt, less current portion.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

On June 18, 2019, Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries were released from their obligations under the PetSmart
ABL Facility. As such, the PetSmart ABL Facility is currently secured by a first-priority security interest in PetSmart,
Inc. and its subsidiaries’ inventory and credit card receivables (excluding the assets of Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries
and our unrestricted subsidiaries), less reserves (the “PetSmart ABL Collateral”), and a second-priority security
interest in all of the other assets of the Company and its current subsidiaries (excluding the assets of Chewy, Inc. and

its subsidiaries and our unrestricted subsidiaries). As a result of the 20% dividend of the outstanding stock of Chewy,
Inc. on June 1, 2018 as discussed in Note 1 which caused Chewy, Inc. to no longer be a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PetSmart, Inc., Chewy, Inc.’s guarantee of the obligations under the Term Loan were automatically released and
terminated. The release and termination of Chewy, Inc.’s guarantee of the obligations under the Term Loan also caused
its guarantee under the indentures governing the senior notes to be released and terminated.

The Term Loan and the 5.875% Notes are secured by a first-priority security interest in all assets of PetSmart,
Inc. and its current subsidiaries (excluding the assets of Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries, the assets of our unrestricted
subsidiaries, and the PetSmart ABL Collateral) and a second-priority security interest in the PetSmart ABL Collateral
(which, after June 18, 2019, excludes the assets of Chewy, Inc. and its subsidiaries). The 7.125% Notes and the 8.875%
Notes are general unsecured obligations effectively subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future secured
debt to the extent of the value of collateral securing such secured debt, are equal in right of payment with all existing
and future senior debt, and senior in right of payment to any future subordinate debt.

All obligations under the Chewy ABL Facility are guaranteed on a senior secured first-lien basis by Chewy,
Inc.’s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and secured, subject to permitted liens and
other exceptions, by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all of Chewy, Inc.’s and its whollyowned domestic subsidiaries’ assets.

Following the completion of the dividend and contribution transactions involving common shares of Chewy,
Inc. on June 1, 2018 as described in Note 1 (collectively, the “Transactions”), the Original Agent under the Term Loan
did not comply with the Company’s request to evidence the release and termination of certain guarantees and security
interests as a result of the Transactions. On June 26, 2018, we commenced an action against the Original Agent in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Action”). The Action requested a judgment,
among other things, directing the Original Agent to perform its obligations under the Term Loan, including the
execution and delivery of all documents necessary to evidence the release and termination of the Chewy, Inc.
guarantees and security interests, and declaring that no event of default occurred under the Term Loan as a result of
the Transactions. On August 16, 2018, we entered into an Agency Assignment Agreement in which the Original Agent
resigned as administrative and collateral agent under the Term Loan, and Wilmington Trust, National Association was
assigned as the successor administrative and collateral agent (“Successor Agent”). Simultaneously, the Successor
Agent was substituted for the Original Agent in the Action. On September 6, 2018, the Successor Agent filed its
answer to our complaint, together with a number of counterclaims against the Company and certain of its affiliates,
challenging the Transactions.

As previously discussed, on April 17, 2019, we entered into Amendment 3 to the Term Loan Credit
Agreement. Amendment 3 provided for, among other things, a direction from Consenting Term Loan lenders to the
Successor Agent to settle the Action. In exchange, Amendment 3 amended the Term Loan Credit Agreement to tighten
certain restrictive covenants, and improve certain economic terms for Consenting Term Loans, including an increase
in the applicable interest rate spread for Consenting Term Loans, requiring that the Company pay a consent fee to
Consenting Term Loan lenders, and requiring that the Company prepay Consenting Term Loans within twelve months
of the effective date of Amendment 3, at par, in an aggregate amount of at least $250.0 million. As discussed above,
the Consenting Term Loans prepayment requirement was satisfied with our principal prepayment of $625.0 million
of Consenting Term Loans made on June 21, 2019.

Also on April 17, 2019, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the “Settlement
Agreement”), which caused the provisions of Amendment 3 to become effective. Upon the effective date of the
Settlement Agreement and Amendment 3, (1) the Successor Agent was directed to (a) withdraw and dismiss, with
prejudice, any causes of action alleged in its answer and counterclaim in the Action and (b) evidence the release and
termination of the applicable guarantees and security interests as a result of the Transactions and (2) each consenting
lender (a) acknowledged and agreed that the Transactions were permitted under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, (b)
ratified the Transactions, and (c) provided customary releases with respect to the Transactions.

On April 17, 2019, a Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal was filed dismissing the Action as well as the
counterclaims asserted by the Successor Agent against the Company and certain of its affiliates.

**_Representations, Warranties, Covenants, and Restricted/Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The PetSmart ABL Facility, the Chewy ABL Facility, the Term Loan, the 7.125% Notes, the 5.875% Notes,
and the 8.875% Notes (collectively referred to as “Credit Facilities”) contain customary representations, warranties,
affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default and cross-default. The negative covenants include
restrictions on our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, make
investments, give guarantees, sell assets, merge, or consolidate. Under the PetSmart ABL Facility and the Term Loan,
we are subject to financial covenants, including certain leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios, and fixed charges
coverage ratios. These financial covenant ratios are only applicable in the event of future material events of the
Company. In addition, the Chewy ABL Facility requires Chewy, Inc. to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage
ratio depending on the excess availability under the facility. We were in compliance with all covenants as of
November 1, 2020.

Chewy, Inc. remains a restricted subsidiary under the agreements governing the PetSmart ABL Facility and
the Term Loan as well as the indentures governing PetSmart, Inc.’s senior notes. Two of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Buddy Chester Corp. and Buddy Chester Sub LLC, are unrestricted subsidiaries under the credit
agreements and the indentures governing PetSmart, Inc.’s senior notes. Buddy Chester Corp.’s assets are comprised
of its ownership of 47,260,902 shares of Class B common stock of Chewy, Inc. (11.5% of the total outstanding shares
of Chewy, Inc. common stock) and its 100% ownership in Buddy Chester Sub LLC. Buddy Chester Sub LLC’s
primary asset is its ownership of 17,584,098 shares of Class A common stock of Chewy, Inc. (4.3% of the total
outstanding shares of Chewy, Inc. common stock), which are pledged as collateral to secure its obligations under the
Forward Contract as discussed in Note 7.

**Note 7 — Forward Purchase Agreement**

On May 11, 2020, the 2020 Mandatory Exchangeable Trust, a third-party Delaware statutory trust (the
“Trust”), closed the offering of 690,000 of its 2020 Mandatory Exchangeable Trust Securities (the “Trust Securities”)
exchangeable into Class A common stock of Chewy, Inc. in a private placement to investors for an aggregate purchase
price of $690.0 million before discounts.

On the same day, the Trust entered into a forward purchase agreement (the “Forward Contract”) with Buddy
Chester Sub LLC (the “Seller”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of PetSmart, Inc. The Forward Contract obligates the
Seller to deliver up to 17,584,098 shares of Class A common stock of Chewy, Inc. (or, at the Seller’s election, an
equivalent amount of cash based on the market price of the Class A common stock at that time) to the Trust on May
16, 2023 (the “Exchange Date”). Under certain circumstances, the Trust Securities may be exchanged prior to the
Exchange Date. On May 11, 2020, the Seller received $535.2 million from the Trust (“Net Proceeds”), which
represented proceeds from the sale of the Trust Securities, excluding an initial purchasers’ discount and amounts
withheld by the Trust to pay for expenses and to purchase U.S. Treasury securities, which will fund quarterly
distributions on the Trust Securities.

On May 13, 2020, the Company used the Net Proceeds, net of expenses incurred by the Seller in connection
with the Forward Contract, to make a principal prepayment of Consenting Term Loans, at par, in an aggregate amount
of $534.0 million.

In connection with the offering of the Trust Securities, on May 8, 2020, the Seller converted 17,584,098
shares of Class B common stock of Chewy, Inc. into Class A common stock of Chewy, Inc. On May 11, 2020, these
shares of Class A common stock were pledged by the Seller to secure its obligations under the Forward Contract. The
number of shares of Class A common stock to ultimately be delivered to the Trust under the Forward Contract will be
equal to the number of Trust Securities outstanding multiplied by a conversion rate, which will be between 21.2368
and 25.4842 and will be determined by reference to the volume-weighted average trading price of the Class A common
stock of Chewy, Inc. during the 20-trading day observation period beginning on, and including, the 24th scheduled
trading day immediately preceding the Exchange Date (the “Daily VWAP”).

The conversion rate will be determined over the 20-trading day observation period as follows for each trading
day during the period: (a) if the Daily VWAP is equal to or greater than $47.09 (the “Threshold Appreciation Price”),
the conversion rate will be equal to 21.2368 divided by 20; (b) if the Daily VWAP is equal to or less than the Threshold
Appreciation Price but greater than or equal to the last reported sale price per share of the Class A common stock on
the New York Stock Exchange as of May 4, 2020, which was $39.24 (the “Initial Price”), the conversion rate will be
between 21.2368 and 25.4842 divided by 20; and (c) if the Daily VWAP is equal to or less than the Initial Price, the
conversion rate will be 25.4842 divided by 20.

Although the settlement of the Forward Contract by the Seller will not occur until the Exchange Date (or
earlier under certain circumstances), the Company’s total ownership of Chewy, Inc. as of November 1, 2020 would
be diluted (all else equal) from 62.2% to a range of 57.9% to 58.6% given the possible range of shares of Class A
common stock to be delivered to the Trust under the Forward Contract.

The Forward Contract is treated as a derivative liability in accordance with ASC 815, _Derivatives and_
_Hedging, and therefore, is recorded at fair value and presented under the caption derivative liability on the Condensed_
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The derivative liability is revalued as of each balance sheet date, and gains and losses
from the change in the fair value of derivative liability are recorded in loss from change in fair value of derivative
liability on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Cash received by the
Seller under the Forward Contract is presented as a financing activity on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows.

The derivative liability was valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions:

**As of**
**November 1, 2020**
Volatility ............................................................................................................................. 51.3%
Risk-free interest rate .......................................................................................................... 0.17%

Fluctuations in the stock price of Chewy, Inc. are a primary driver for the changes in the derivative liability
valuation during each reporting period. As the stock price increases, the value of the instrument generally increases,
therefore increasing the liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, stock price volatility
is one of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s derivative liability.
The simulated fair value of the derivative liability is sensitive to changes in the expected volatility of the stock price
of Chewy, Inc. Increases in expected volatility would generally result in a lower fair value measurement.

During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, we recognized a loss from the change in
fair value of derivative liability of $130.2 million and $402.3 million, respectively. The following table provides a
summary of changes in fair value of the Company’s Level 3 derivative liability during the thirty-nine weeks ended
November 1, 2020 (in thousands):

**Thirty-Nine Weeks**

**Ended**
**November 1, 2020**
Proceeds from Forward Contract......................................................................................... $ 535,223
Loss from change in fair value of derivative liability .......................................................... 402,342

Ending balance of derivative liability .................................................................................. $ 937,565

**Note 8— Leases**

We lease the vast majority of our stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and
corporate offices under noncancelable operating and finance leases. The terms of our real estate leases generally range
from 10 to 20 years and typically allow us to renew for up to four additional 5-year terms. Store leases, including
exercised renewal options, expire at various dates through 2033. Distribution and fulfillment center, customer service
center, and corporate office leases, including exercised renewal options, expire at various dates through 2037.
Generally, our real estate leases require us to pay variable lease costs of property taxes, utilities, common area
maintenance, and insurance. We also lease certain equipment under operating and finance leases. Finance lease rightof-use assets, net of accumulated depreciation, are included in property and equipment, net, on the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In April 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance allowing entities to make a policy
election whether to account for lease concessions related to the COVID-19 pandemic as lease modifications. The
election applies to any lessor-provided lease concession related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, provided

the concession does not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or in the obligations of the lessee.
During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020, we received non-substantial concessions from certain
landlords in the form of abatements. We have elected to not account for these rent concessions as lease modifications.
The recognition of rent concessions did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements
as of or during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 1, 2020.

On August 12, 2020, Chewy, Inc. finalized agreements with a local government agency for certain ad valorem
tax benefits provided to Chewy, Inc. in connection with a maximum capital investment of $70 million in property and
equipment purchases for a new fulfillment center over a three-year timeframe. To facilitate the incentives, the
government agency will issue its Taxable Industrial Development Revenue Bonds, Series 2020 (the “Bonds”), in a
maximum aggregate principal amount of $70 million. In exchange for the Bonds, Chewy, Inc. will convey the
purchased equipment to the local government agency and will lease the equipment from this agency. Chewy, Inc. will
not pay any cash for the Bonds nor receive any cash for the conveyance of the equipment. Upon termination of the
lease, including early termination, the equipment will be conveyed to Chewy, Inc. for a nominal fee.

**Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Advertising Purchase Commitments_**

As of November 1, 2020, we had obligations to purchase $12.2 million of advertising through the remainder
of fiscal year 2020 and $14.0 million in fiscal year 2021.

**_Product and Services Purchase Commitments_**

As of November 1, 2020, we had various commitments to purchase merchandise and services from certain
vendors, including $8.6 million through the remainder of fiscal year 2020, $39.4 million in fiscal year 2021, $26.1
million in fiscal year 2022, $12.2 million in fiscal year 2023, $3.7 million in fiscal year 2024, and $1.2 million
thereafter.

**_Sales Tax Liability_**

The Company collects and remits sales tax in jurisdictions in which it has a physical presence or it believes
a nexus exists. The Company continually evaluates whether it may have a nexus in new jurisdictions with respect to
sales tax. The Company has recorded an estimated liability for potential exposure in states where there is uncertainty
about the point in time at which the Company established a sufficient in-state business presence to create a nexus and
the Company did not collect sales tax. Changes in management’s assumptions may occur in the future as the Company
obtains new information, which can result in adjustments to the recorded liability. Increases and decreases to the
liability for uncollected sales tax are included in operating, general, and administrative expenses on the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

**_Litigation and Settlements_**

In the normal course of our business, we are subject to actual and threatened legal actions and proceedings,
including those related to alleged violations of labor and employment laws, intellectual property rights, consumer
protection laws, premises liability, contract disputes, and other laws and regulations.

While we currently do not expect that the ultimate outcome of the proceedings and claims pending or
threatened against us will have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements, the
outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, and if decided adversely to us, or if we determine that settlement of
particular litigation is appropriate, we may be subject to liability that could have a material adverse effect on our
condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for a particular period.

**Note 10 — Subsequent Events**

The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through December 8, 2020, the
date at which the condensed consolidated financial statements were available to be issued, and determined that there
were no additional items to disclose.
