The transaction was carried out through the incorporation of BEEP S.p.A. (“BEEP”), which acquired the entire shareholding of BIP S.p.A., and subsequently BEEP was merged with and into BIP. As BEEP was incorporated on March 13, 2018 and took control of BIP S.p.A. on March 27, 2018, the income statement presented for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 is for the period from March 13, 2018, the date of BEEP’s incorporation, to December 31, 2018, and reflects the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of BIP for the period from March 27 until December 31, 2018. As such, the results of operations for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 are not directly comparable to those for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. In order to show the underlying trend of the business we present pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 which also includes the consolidated financial information of BIP for the period prior to the acquisition on March 27, 2018.

630_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.3,Comparability of Financial information,7.3.3,Application of IFRS 16 (Leases),"We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on January 1, 2019. The main impact of the new standard for lessors is the recognition of nearly all leases in the statement of financial position, subject to certain exemptions including in relation to short term and low value leases, effectively eliminating the different methods for accounting for operating leases and financial leases. IFRS 16 provides for recognizing a right-of-use asset (right to use the leased asset) and a lease liability referring to the future payments for which a contractual obligation exists. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2019 using the simplified approach, without restating the comparative period for the year ended December 31, 2018. Right-of-use assets were initially valued in accordance with the lease liability (adjusted for any prepaid or allocated lease costs as of December 31, 2018). The lease liability was discounted by applying a discount rate to the present value of the expected future lease payments as of January 1, 2019. Due to the adoption of such new reporting standard, our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the corresponding figures presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be directly comparable with the corresponding figures derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540
630_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.4,Impact of the Acquisition,7.4.1,,"The consolidated financial statements of BIP in this Offering Memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect any changes which might occur as a result of the purchase price allocation (“PPA”) to be performed in connection with the Acquisition. The application of PPA adjustments could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our statement of financial position, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, brands, rights of use, contractual rights with franchisees leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future consolidated financial statements could be materially different from the Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum, once the PPA adjustments have been made. Under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations,” the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair market values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the acquirer’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In accordance with IFRS 3, the allocation of the purchase price can be provisional from the acquisition date for up to twelve months, although management must make its best estimate at the reporting date within that period. xiii -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. For more information about how we define these non-IFRS measures, see “Summary Consolidated Financial Information—As Adjusted Financial Information and Other Financial _Data.” Non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS or any_ other generally accepted accounting principles. Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently and, consequently, our presentation may not be readily comparable to other companies’ figures. In particular, you should not consider our non-IFRS measures to be alternatives to (i) profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (iii) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Although certain of this data has been extracted or derived from our consolidated financial statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, this data has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of performance under IFRS and you should not consider them as an alternative to profit/(loss) before taxes or profit/(loss) for the period determined in accordance with IFRS, or, as the case may be, or to cash flows from/(used in) operating activities, xiv ----- cash from/(used in) investing activities or cash flow from/(used in) financing activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant finance expenses, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; - although depreciation, amortization and write-offs are non-monetary items, the assets being depreciated, amortized and/or written-off will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; and - the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. These measures presented in this Offering Memorandum are not prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting principles and may be used by different companies for different purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. You should exercise caution in comparing this data to similar measures used by other companies. The information presented has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards. In addition, the presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and will not be subject to review by the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of this information. These measures are not measurements of performance under IFRS or any other accounting principles and you should not consider them as an alternative to profit/(loss) before taxes or profit/(loss) from continuing operations determined in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting principles, or, as the case may be, or to cash flows from/(used in) operating activities, cash used in investing activities or cash flow from/(used in) financing activities.

630_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading European consulting firm, providing management consulting, business integration and digital transformation services to more than 600 clients. We were established in 2003 as a result of a spin-off from Deloitte Consulting Italia. As of June 30, 2021, we had 3,641 employees. Our professional team includes 36 equity partners (the “Equity Partners”) and 111 partners, directors, associate partners, client partners and competence partners. Since we were established, we have expanded our geographic reach to 12 countries with 16 offices through our strong organic growth of approximately 16.7% per annum from 2004 to 2020 (in particular, we maintained organic growth during the financial crisis from 2008 to 2012 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020) and selective accretive acquisitions. We provide a wide range of advisory solutions and services to enterprise clients, including business advisory, strategy and innovation, technological advisory, digital advisory, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, digital twin, blockchain, data and analytics and digital delivery. Recognizing the importance of technological advances and digital transformation for clients and businesses, we were early to establish our innovation practice in 2009 and digital practice in 2013. The growing importance of technological advances and digital transformation to our clients combined with our in-depth industry specific knowledge and technological and digital competencies, have resulted in approximately 64% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 being related to digital transformation projects. We generated approximately 68.4% of our revenues in Italy for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Our other principal geographies include Brazil, the UK, Spain, Switzerland, the USA, and Colombia. In addition, we operate in other countries including Chile, Turkey, Austria, Belgium, and the UAE. We operate across several sectors of the economy with industry-specific knowledge supported by our technology and digital innovation competencies. Our key industries include (i) Energy & Utilities, (ii) Telecommunication, Media & Entertainment (“TMT”), (iii) Financial Services, (iv) Public Sector & Healthcare, (v) Manufacturing, (vi) Retail, (the “Reference Industries”) as well as (vii) Transportation. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated revenues of €330.7 million, Adjusted EBITDA of €61.5 million (representing an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 18.6%) and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €62.3 million. We also have a strong pipeline of ongoing projects, with a total Backlog as of June 30, 2021 of €134.8 million (compared to €81.8 million as of June 30, 2020), of which we expect €117.0 million to be converted into revenue in 2021. Our cash conversion rate (calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA) was 93% over the same period. 1 ----- The charts below set forth our revenue by industry and geography for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and by service area for the year ended December 31, 2020:",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

According to Source Global Research, our addressable market, which includes the Reference Industries in Italy, the UK, Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, other South America, the USA and the Middle East (“Reference Geographic Market,” together with the Reference Industries, the “Reference Market”) was estimated to be valued at approximately $58.0 billion in annual global sales in 2020, having grown at a CAGR of approximately 6% between 2018 and 2019. The market has been temporarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and is expected to rebound from 2021 and grow at a CAGR of 12.5% between 2020 and 2024. We have consistently out-performed the Reference Market, including during the COVID-19 pandemic reporting 7% organic growth in terms of revenues between 2019 and 2020. Our Reference Market benefits from strong ongoing digitalization trends across the public and private sectors and changes in operating models of companies and clients, further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, driving the need of specialized external consulting resources and increasing spending on transformation projects. Our wide range of end to end solutions, with distinctive digital capabilities, coupled with in-depth specific industry know-how and long-lasting relationships with our clients and partners, position us effectively to capitalize on the strong growth in demand for consulting services across our main industry verticals. Our clients include more than 600 private and blue chip companies, as well as public sector organizations, comprising Energy & Utilities companies (including Gruppo Enel, BP (British Petroleum), Gruppo Eni, Gruppo ACEA, Gruppo A2A, Enagas, Naturgy, Petrobras, Repsol and Snam), TMT companies (including Sky, Telecom Italia, Fastweb, and Teamsystem), Italian and European Financial Services institutions (including Allianz, UniCredit, Gruppo Generali, Gruppo BNP Paribas, ICCREA, AGOS, Nexi, Santander, UBS, and Visa), Public Sector organizations (including Poste Italiane, Banca d’Italia, the Istituto Nazionale Previdenza Sociale (INPS), the Italian Ministry of Justice (Ministero della Giustizia), and the Home Office (UK)), Healthcare companies (including Pfizer, GE healthcare, Novartis, Astrazeneca, Roche and Sanofi), Manufacturing companies (including Amplifon, Barilla, Leonardo and Daimler), Retail business (including Esselunga, Kering, and Luxottica), and Transportation companies (including ENAV). We aim to create long-term, strategic relationships with our clients, and to be an integral part of our clients’ business development and strategy implementation, focusing on value added projects that are normally related to recurring capital expenditures with lower renewal risk. Historically, we have been able to achieve long-lasting client relationships by providing a broad services offering covering our clients’ needs, including significantly customized and highly specialized services, as well as delivering consistent high-quality services. As of June 30, 2021, we had an average client relationship tenure of approximately 18 years for our top 10 clients and approximately nine years for our top 11 to top 20 clients. We have a low client concentration across all of our industry verticals, with no client accounting for more than 7.5% of our revenues and no industry vertical accounting for more than 27.7% of our revenues for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our top 10 clients generated approximately 33.3% of our revenues. 2 ----- Our ability to deliver value to our clients is a result of the character and expertise of our people. We rely on an entrepreneurial and committed leadership team of 36 Equity Partners, 111 partners, directors, associate partners, client partners and competence partners, and an experienced team of 257 senior managers and principals, who are supported by a talented pool of 3,237 other employees as of June 30, 2021. We combine core consulting skills and industry know-how with digital expertise in areas such as data and analytics, cybersecurity, customer relationship management (“CRM”) and digital delivery, cloud and artificial intelligence and automation, all fostered by a culture of innovation that extends to all reaches of our company. Historically, we have devoted significant resources to attract, train, develop, and retain our people. As a result, our workforce has grown from approximately 2,200 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 3,641 as of June 30, 2021, of which approximately 28% is based outside of Italy, driven by the increase of our digital practice as well as our internationalization, coupled with what we believe is best in class talent retention policies. We believe our business model has allowed us to quickly respond to our clients’ needs and continue to efficiently operate our business during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, during the periods of lockdown in Italy, Spain, Brazil and the UK, we were able to continue to ensure business continuity and service our clients, while safeguarding the health and safety of our employees. We successfully transitioned substantially all of our employees to remote working over a short period of time, maintaining high levels of service and assisting our clients with their responses to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of €286.2 million, compared to €242.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 representing an increase in revenues of 17.9%, of which approximately 7% was organic compared to an estimated approximately 13% decrease for the overall global consulting market.

630_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.1,Large and growing consulting market with BIP exposed to the most attractive trends shaping the management consulting space,"The global consulting market, which was estimated to be valued at approximately $136.0 billion in annual global sales in 2020 by Source Global Research, is a large and attractive market, having grown at a CAGR of approximately 6% between 1997 and 2019, with a continuous positive trend as companies have historically increased spend on external consulting services. Our Reference Market grew at a CAGR of approximately 6% between 2018 and 2019 and was only temporarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. While the overall global consulting market experienced a 13% decrease, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of €286.2 million, compared to €242.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 representing an increase in revenues of 17.9%, of which approximately 7% was organic. We have consistently out-performed the Reference Market, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Reference Market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of approximately 12.5% from 2020 until 2024 principally driven by (i) ongoing digitalization trends across the public and private sectors accompanied by an increase in spending on digital transformation projects, (ii) changes in operating models of companies and clients, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has focused businesses on the need for specialized external consulting resources, and (iii) shifting demand from traditional IT outsourcing and system integration to value-added technology advisory and delivery. We believe that our wide range of services, with distinctive digital capabilities, coupled with in-depth specific industry know-how underpinned by long-lasting client relationships, position us favorably to capitalize on the strong growth in demand for consulting services across our main markets. We have an extensive track record innovating, designing and implementing digital transformation projects that rethink our clients’ service delivery and sales functions, and these projects will continue to be central to the strategy of the major organizations of our Reference Industries. The consulting market in Italy, our primary geographic market, was estimated to be valued at approximately €4.6 billion in 2020 according to Assoconsult. The Italian consulting market grew at a CAGR of approximately 8.0% between 2015 and 2019, and experienced a temporary decrease of approximately 4.2% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Assoconsult. Despite this decrease, our revenues in Italy were €212.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €20.0 million, or 10.4%, compared to €192.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019 due to the organic growth of our business, an increase in demand for traditional and digital services, and the minor acquisition of Vidiemme. In 2021, the Italian consulting market is estimated to increase by approximately 8.5%, driven by demand for: (i) digital 3 ----- projects including artificial intelligence, CRM, cloud services, internet of things (“IoT”), cybersecurity, digital twin and blockchain; and (ii) green projects such as developing and implementing sustainability strategies and plans to achieve greater corporate social responsibility. In addition, growth of the Italian consulting market is expected to further benefit from the structural under penetration of consulting spend in Italy, according to Assoconsult. Additionally, the Italian government and regulators are implementing policies that favor digitalization through IT investments, such as the Industry 4.0 plan and the National Plan for Innovation 2025. In addition, in July 2021, the Italian Government adopted the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e _Resilienza) (the “RRP”) which is expected to allocate resources totaling €235.0 billion between 2021 and 2026_ for a reform agenda and investment program encompassing six policy areas or “missions” in Italy, of which approximately €50.0 billion is expected to be invested in the “digitalization, innovation, competitiveness, and culture” mission in Italy, and approximately €70.0 billion is expected to be invested in the “green revolution and ecologic transition” mission in Italy. We are at the intersection of these megatrends with an innovative and digital-focused practice, deep industry experience, and proven capabilities in the energy transition. We aim to capture part of the budget allocated to these initiatives to be spent by corporate and public sector organizations, which we believe will provide us with further opportunity to grow and boost our track record in next-generation advisory.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

In addition, we offer a wide range of services from strategy development to strategy implementation, with a strong focus on digital transformation and innovation.

As of June 30, 2021, we had an average relationship tenure of approximately 18 years for our top 10 clients and approximately nine years for our top 11 to top 20 clients. We have a track-record of new client additions, having increased our client base from approximately 280 clients as of December 31, 2017 to approximately 600 clients as of December 31, 2020 as a result of a combination of organic growth in our key markets and selective merger and acquisition (“M&A”) activity in existing and new markets. We believe that our increased client base and enhanced geographic diversification, also following our recent acquisition of Chaucer in the UK, will offer us significant cross-selling opportunities and new avenues of growth outside of Italy.

Additionally, our revenue has remained resilient throughout volatile macroeconomic cycles, including through the period following the 2008 financial crisis, with our revenues’ organic growth continuously outperforming the overall consulting market as well as Italian GDP growth on a year-over-year basis. Leveraging our resilient and flexible business model, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating performance and our ability to deliver our services to clients during the government imposed lockdowns was minimal.

The Private PIK Notes will mature in 2028 and have incurrence covenants substantially similar to the covenants of the Notes, as amended to reflect, among other things, the different position of Holdco and the Private PIK Notes in the capital structure. Interest on the Private PIK Notes is payable in kind.

The Private PIK Notes are not guaranteed by, and do not receive any other credit support from, the Issuer and its subsidiaries. For further information, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Private PIK Notes.” The net proceeds from the Private PIK Notes were downstreamed from Holdco to Midco via a shareholder loan with mirror terms and subsequently contributed to the equity of Bidco, and thereafter, with other sources of financing, used to complete the Acquisition. (4) The Shareholder Funding represents €405.5 million in equity contributed by Holdco to Midco to the Issuer resulting, indirectly, from equity contributions from CVC and the Equity Partners and the net proceeds of the Private PIK Notes. See “Summary—The _Transactions—Financing the Acquisition.”_ (5) Bach Midco S.p.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of a newly formed company incorporated under the laws of Italy (“Midco”) is the holding company that directly owns the Issuer and was formed to acquire, directly or indirectly: (a) 100% of the issued share capital of Milapax S.à r.l.

Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, if the Issuer, any Guarantor or the paying agent is required by law to withhold or deduct such taxes with respect to a payment on any Note, such Issuer or Guarantor will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by each holder after such withholding is not less than the amount that would have been received in the absence of the withholding. The Issuer is organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy and therefore payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. Subject to and as set forth in “Description of _the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will not be liable to pay_ any additional amounts to holders of the Notes if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from 18 ----- time to time) (“Decree No. 239”) or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time) (“Decree No. 461”), except, in the case of Decree No. 239 and Decree No. 461, where the procedures required under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461, as applicable, in order to benefit from an exemption have not been complied with due to solely the actions or omissions of the Issuer or its agents. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Although we believe that, under current law, Italian substitute tax will not be imposed under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 where a holder of Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy included in the list provided for by Italian Ministerial Decree dated September 4, 1996, as amended from time to time, or, as from the tax year in which the Ministerial Decree to be issued under Article 11, paragraph 4, let. c) of Decree No. 239 is effective, included in the list therein provided (the “White List”) and such holder of Notes complies with certain certification requirements, there is no assurance that this will be the case. Moreover, holders of the Notes will bear the risk of any change in Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 after the date hereof, including any change in the white list countries. See “Description of the _Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Prospective purchasers of Notes should_ consult their tax advisors as to the overall tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes, including, in particular, the effect of any state, regional or local tax laws of any country or territory. Tax Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction are announced and become effective on or after the issuance of the Notes that would require the Issuer or the Guarantors (if any) to pay additional amounts (as defined in “Description of the Notes— _Withholding Taxes”), the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but_ not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. See “Description of _the Notes—Change of Control.”_ Original Issue Discount . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for US federal income tax purposes. In such event, US Holders (as defined under “Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations”) generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, US Holders will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

The transaction was carried out through the incorporation of BEEP S.p.A. (“BEEP”), which acquired the entire shareholding of BIP S.p.A., and subsequently BEEP was merged with and into BIP. As BEEP was incorporated on March 13, 2018 and took control of BIP S.p.A. on March 27, 2018, the income statement presented for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 is for the period from March 13, 2018, the date of BEEP’s incorporation, to December 31, 2018, and reflects the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of BIP for the period from March 27 to December 31, 2018. As such, the results of operations for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 are not directly comparable to those for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. In order to show the underlying trend of the business we present pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 which also includes the consolidated financial information of BIP for the period prior to the acquisition on March 27, 2018. The pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 was prepared by adding BIP’s financial statement figures for the period from March 13, 2018 (reflecting BIP results and cash flows from March 27, 2018) until December 31, 2018 taken or derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements to the amounts for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 26, 2018 taken or derived from the consolidated historical financial information of BIP S.p.A. prior to its merger with BEEP, which are not included in this Offering Memorandum. The pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented for illustrative purposes only, has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the US Exchange Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any other generally accepted accounting principles, and has not been audited nor reviewed in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Italy) or any other 22 ----- auditing standards. In addition, the pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 was not prepared in accordance with IFRS 16 as we adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on January 1, 2019. _Application of IFRS 16 (Leases)_ We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on January 1, 2019. The main impact of the new standard for lessors is the recognition of nearly all leases in the statement of financial position, subject to certain exemptions including in relation to short term and low value leases, effectively eliminating the different methods for accounting for operating leases and financial leases. IFRS 16 provides for recognizing a right-of-use asset (right to use the leased asset) and a lease liability referring to the future payments for which a contractual obligation exists. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2019 using the simplified approach, without restating the comparative period for the year ended December 31, 2018. Right-of-use assets were initially valued in accordance with the lease liability (adjusted for any prepaid or allocated lease costs as of December 31, 2018). The lease liability was discounted by applying a discount rate to the present value of the expected future lease payments as of January 1, 2019. Due to the adoption of such new reporting standard, our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the corresponding figures presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be directly comparable with the corresponding figures derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of performance under IFRS and you should not consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as alternatives to operating income or consolidated profit or as a measure of our operating performance, cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful indicators of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist securities analysts, investors and other parties to evaluate us. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures may be used by different companies for different purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies.

We experience fluctuations in our annual and quarterly financial results, including revenues, operating income and EBITDA, for reasons that include: (i) the types and complexity, number, size, timing and duration of client engagements; (ii) the timing of revenues; (iii) as consulting staff headcount growth is the primary means by which we are able to recognize revenue growth, any inability to hire additional, qualified personnel or failure to timely and effectively deploy such personnel against funded Backlog could negatively affect our ability to grow our revenue; (iv) the utilization of revenue-generating professionals, including the ability to adjust staffing levels up or down to accommodate the business and prospects of the applicable industry and service area; (v) the time it takes before a new hire becomes profitable; (vi) the geographic locations of our clients or the locations where services are rendered; (vii) billing rates and fee arrangements, including the opportunity and ability to successfully reach milestones, and complete engagements and collect outcome-contingent or performance-based fees; (viii) the length of billing and collection cycles and changes in amounts that may become uncollectible; (ix) changes in the frequency and complexity of government regulatory and enforcement activities; (x) business and asset acquisitions; and (xi) economic factors beyond our control. The results of the industries in which our clients operate and the service areas we offer may be affected differently by the above factors. Certain of the industries that we serve and our service areas tend to experience their highest demand during periods when market conditions are less favorable for many businesses. For example, in periods of limited credit availability, reduced M&A activity and/or declining business and/or consumer spending, while not always the case, there may be increased restructuring opportunities that will cause the financial services industry to experience higher demand. On the other hand, those same factors may cause a number of other industries or our service areas to experience reduced demand. The positive effects of certain events or factors on certain industries or our service areas may not be sufficient to overcome the negative effects of those same events or factors on other parts of our business. In addition, our mix of service areas adds complexity to the task of predicting revenues and results of operations and managing our staffing levels and expenditures across changing business cycles and economic environments. Our results are subject to seasonal and similar factors, such as during the third quarter when our employees and clients typically take vacations. We may also experience fluctuations in cash flows because of the timing of incentive payments, which we generally pay during the second and the third quarter of each year. Also, the timing of investments or acquisitions and the cost of integrating them may cause fluctuations in our financial results, including operating income and cash flows. This volatility makes it difficult to forecast our future results with precision and to assess accurately whether increases or decreases in any one or more quarters are likely to cause annual results to exceed or fall short of previously issued guidance. While we assess our annual guidance at the end of each quarter and update such guidance when we think it is appropriate, unanticipated future volatility can cause actual results to vary significantly from our guidance, even where that guidance reflects a range of possible results and has been updated to take account of partial-year results. 29 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

We cannot be certain that our Backlog will generate the expected revenue or cash flows or generate them when we expect. Unforeseen events or circumstances, including, for example, termination or scaling down of contracts, increased time requirements to complete the work, delays in commencing work, disruption of work, litigation associated with amounts included in our Backlog, resulting in the termination of such contracts or exclusion of our ability to perform them, or other unforeseen events (such as those discussed in these “Risk Factors”) may affect contracts in our Backlog and could negatively impact our results of operation and financial position.

Because of contract terminations or suspensions and changes in contract scope and schedule, we cannot predict with certainty when, or if, our Backlog will be actualized. We can provide no assurance that we will not receive additional terminations, and, even where a contract proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the client may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us. To the extent we are unable to realize the pipeline of revenue associated with contracts in our Backlog due to material delays, terminations or payment defaults, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our agreements with contractors also include provisions requiring such contractors to enter into suitable insurance. We also maintain general liability insurance coverage, for damage caused by disclosure of confidential information, system failures, errors, or unsatisfactory performance of services to our clients in the event of a third-party claim citing damages or financial loss. However, we may incur losses that may be beyond the limits, or outside the scope, of coverage of our insurance and that may limit or prevent indemnification under our insurance policies. In addition, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future. Further, certain categories of risks may not be insurable at a reasonable cost, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. It is unclear if, and how, our insurance policies will cover any damages we may suffer in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and how our insurers will handle any related requests for damages in the future. Should our insurance providers fail to cover losses or damages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or should they modify their approach in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected.

The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported profitability when translated into euros for financial reporting purposes. The majority of our revenue is denominated in euros, and our costs are primarily in euros. These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for services provided by us. As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party clients in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the “functional currency”). Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations.

In addition, our ability to service our clients is also impacted by our subcontractors ability to fulfil their obligations to us in a timely, quality manner. In particular, large and complex projects often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems, or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers. Our profitability, in part, depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors, and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance, and we may be held liable to our clients for the correct performance of contractual obligations of such subcontractors, vendors, or service providers. In addition, we provide implementation, maintenance, and other services to our clients with respect to software and platforms created or provided by third parties. Such third parties may disagree with the way we implement, maintain, or provide our services with respect to their products to our clients, or may claim that we interfere with their relationship with our client, as a result of which we could become liable for damages or our relationship with our clients could be negatively impacted. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and we might incur significant additional liabilities if any of our third-party providers ceases its operations, does not meet its obligations or client expectations, or if it terminates or refuses to renew its relationships with us or seeks to renegotiate prices or other terms of our contracts with them at more onerous terms for us. 31 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

We have previously recorded impairment charges to the carrying value of goodwill, and it is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges in the future. Such charges have had and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We expect that we may record certain amounts of goodwill in connection with the Merger.

With our primary clients, we often utilize framework agreements that regulate the rates and contract conditions, and these are negotiated from time to time. The volume of work performed for any particular client is likely to vary from year to year, and a major client in one financial period may not require, or may decide not to use, our services in any subsequent financial period. Moreover, a large portion of our new engagements comes from existing clients. Accordingly, the failure to obtain new large engagements or multiple engagements from existing or new clients could have a material adverse effect on the amount of revenues we generate. In addition, companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If one of our current client merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for the services and solutions we offer, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunities from the merger or consolidation. In a particular geographic market, service, or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service, or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service, or industry group. Many of our engagement agreements can also be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty. In client engagements that involve multiple engagements or stages, there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements. For clients in bankruptcy, a bankruptcy court could elect not to retain our interim management consultants, terminate our retention, require us to reduce our fees for the duration of an engagement, elect not to approve claims against fees earned by us prior to or after the bankruptcy filing, or subject previously paid amounts to be returned to the bankruptcy estate as preferential payments under the bankruptcy code. Terminations of engagements, cancellations of portions of the project plan, delays in the work schedule, or reductions in fees could result from factors unrelated to our services. When engagements are terminated or reduced, we lose the associated future revenues, and we may not be able to recover associated costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to minimize the negative impact. In addition, our clients’ ability to terminate engagements with little or no notice and without penalty makes it difficult to predict our operating results in any particular fiscal period. If any of the clients we derive a significant portion of our revenue from terminate, cancel, delay projects, or reduce our fees, or if we are unable to obtain new engagements from these clients, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 32 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540
630_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,"Risks Related to our Industry, Client Concentration and Competition",13.2.2,The markets in which we operate are highly competitive.,"We offer consulting services across a number of technology focused service areas including: (i) business advisory; (ii) technology advisory; (iii) advisory digital; (iv) strategy digital; (v) x-tech (our exponential technologies service area); (vi) cybersecurity; and (vii) delivery digital. For more information about these service areas, please see “Business—Our Service Areas.” Our business advisory service area represents our core offering and accounted for the 36% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. We also provide technology focused services in countries such as Brazil, Italy, Spain, and the UK. Our competitors vary across all of our service areas, industries or geographic regions. For example, we compete with different companies or businesses depending on the particular nature of a proposed engagement, and the types of requested services and the location of the client or delivery of the services. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid change. We believe the principal competitive factors in these markets are service quality, technical and industry expertise, price, innovation, established relationships with key clients, often on a local level, knowledge of the regulatory framework, rapidity in providing services requested by clients and the ability to add value to our clients’ businesses. We compete for business with a variety of players, including large multinational firms and local players that provide a broad range of consulting, technology and/or business process services, in-house potential client engagement services, software services companies that provide business process services and accounting firms that provide IT consulting services, which offer niche services that are the same or similar to the services we offer. Some of our competitors have significantly more financial resources, more expansive national or international presence, more personnel, and greater brand recognition than we do. Some have lower overhead and other costs and can compete through lower cost-service offerings. We depend, in large part, on professional relationships. As a result, our business has low barriers to entry for professionals electing to start their own firms or work independently. In addition, it is relatively easy for professionals to change employers. Our main competitors include Deloitte, Accenture, Ernst & Young, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Boston Consulting Group, and Kearney, among others. Some of our competitors may benefit from greater economies of scale, have greater financial, marketing, technological, or other resources, larger client bases and better-established reputations and client relationships in our markets than we do, and have greater geographic coverage. As a result, some of our competitors may be able to: - more efficiently or more rapidly develop superior services or solutions, gain greater market acceptance, and expand their service offerings; - more quickly adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements; - bundle services with other services they provide at reduced prices and offer services across more countries and regions; - adopt more aggressive pricing policies, offer more favorable terms, and devote greater resources to the promotion, marketing, which could cause us to have to lower prices for certain services to remain competitive in the market; - devote greater resources to the research and development of their services; and - better withstand adverse market conditions. Increased competition may also result in lower prices and volumes, higher costs for resources, especially personnel, higher costs for research and development programs and, thus, lower profitability. As a result, we may not be able to supply clients with services that they deem superior at competitive prices, we may be unable to continue to attract new clients, and we may lose market share to our competitors. Any inability to face increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Involvement in, as well as bidding for, contracts with governments or governmental agencies, public clients, and private entities in regulated industries carry various risks and uncertainties inherent in the contracting process, including the following: - government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and a change in the applicable law, among 33 ----- other reasons. Centralization of public spending decisions and other changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions, or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses, and profits on work completed prior to the termination; - terms and conditions of contracts with public sector entities tend to be more onerous than other contracts and may include, among others, extensive rights of audit, more punitive service-level penalties, and other restrictive covenants; - contractual non-compliance (including improper billing), failure to comply with procurement regulations and regulation regarding the protection of classified information, and other improper or illegal activities, may result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government, in addition to other typical remedies for breach of contract, which may include termination of the relevant contracts, forfeiture of profits, and suspension of payments; - government contracts are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other contracts. Any negative publicity related to such contracts, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity, may adversely affect our business and reputation; - participation in government contracts could subject us to stricter regulatory requirements, which may increase our cost of compliance, as well as limit and/or prevent our ability to participate to certain public tenders due to such regulatory or compliance requirements; - political and economic factors, such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision-makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenue, can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs for which we bid for, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services, and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed; - government contracts may involve multiple parties in the delivery of services and require greater project management efforts on our part, and any failure in this regard may adversely impact our performance and reputation; - participation in contracts with the governments or governmental agencies, and public and private clients who operate in regulated industries, for which we have partnered with another consulting firm or third party may be limited or prevented if that the third party or consulting firm does not have sufficient resources to prepare the bid and proposal, lacks the required financial commitment required for such process, is unable to obtain internal approvals or if there is a conflict of interest, among other reasons; - competing tenderers who lose a tender may challenge the decision of the governments or governmental agencies, and public and private clients who operate in regulated industries to award us a contract (which may be based on various reasons, such as the claim that the competing tenderer was not granted a fair chance of obtaining the contract). In such a scenario, we may have limited ability to (if any) intervene or defend such a claim, which may result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in termination, reduction, or modification of the awarded contract as well as expenses and delays; - the substantial cost and managerial time and effort spent to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us; - the ability to accurately estimate the resources and costs that will be required to service any contract we are awarded; - litigation or disputes with government and public entities may lead to us being banned from contracting with other government and public entities or participating in public tenders, which would have both an economic and a reputational impact on us; and - public sector-related clients sometimes follow payment management processes that are subject to review by other government authorities or other entities, which may cause delays or adjustments to their own payment schedule.

The agreements prohibit such individuals from competing with us during the term of their employment and for a fixed period afterwards and from seeking to solicit our employees or clients. In some cases, but not all, we may obtain non-competition or non-solicitation agreements from parties who sell us their businesses or assets. The duration of post-employment non-competition and non-solicitation agreements typically ranges from six to 12 months. Non-competition agreements with the sellers of businesses or assets that we acquire typically continue longer than 12 months.

We cannot assure you that one or more of the parties from whom we acquire a business or assets, or who do not join us or leave our employment, will not compete with us or solicit our employees or clients in the future. States and foreign jurisdictions may interpret restrictions on competition narrowly and in favor of employees or sellers. Therefore, certain restrictions on competition or solicitation may be unenforceable. In addition, we may not pursue legal remedies if we determine that preserving cooperation and a professional relationship with a former employee or his or her clients, or other concerns, outweighs the benefits of any possible legal recourse or the likelihood of success does not justify the costs of pursuing a legal remedy.

Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and human resources in balance with client demand around the world. To attract and retain clients, we need to demonstrate professional acumen and build trust and strong relationships. Our professionals have highly specialized skills. They also develop strong bonds with the clients they serve. Our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain professionals who have expertise, a good reputation, and strong client relationships. We face intense competition in recruiting and retaining highly qualified professionals, in particular professionals with digital capabilities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain qualified professionals to maintain or expand our business. If we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate, and retain qualified professionals, our ability to continue to secure work may suffer. Moreover, competition has caused our costs of retaining and hiring qualified professionals to increase, a trend that could continue and could adversely affect our operating and financial results. Our people are our primary assets and account for the majority of our expenses. During periods of reduced demand for our services, or in response to unfavorable changes in market or industry conditions, we may seek to align our cost structure more closely with our revenues and increase our utilization rates by reducing headcount and eliminating or consolidating underused locations. Following such actions, in response to subsequent increases in demand for our services, including as a result of favorable changes in market or industry conditions, we may need to hire, train and integrate additional qualified and skilled personnel, and may be unable to do so to meet our needs or our clients’ demands on a timely basis. If we are unable to manage staffing levels on a timely basis in light of changing opportunities or conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to accept or service business opportunities and client engagements, take advantage of positive market and industry developments, and realize future growth could be negatively affected, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. In addition, while increased utilization resulting from headcount reductions may enhance our profitability in the near term, it could negatively affect our business over the longer term by limiting the time our professionals have to seek out and cultivate new client relationships and win new projects. Flexibility in human resource management is also significantly affected by labor laws and regulations and by the terms of the agreements with unions and government authorities. Labor law and union practices provide significant protections for worker rights in various countries in which we operate, including Italy. If there is a market decline or a reduction in business and we are unable to reorganize our workforce consistently with the resulting fluctuation in work load, or otherwise to adjust our production capacity, or is required to incur significant costs in connection therewith, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 35 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The replacement of certain members of our senior leadership team may involve the expenditure of significant time and financial resources, and the loss of any such individual may delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. Competition for senior management and other personnel in our industry is intense, and the pool of suitable candidates is limited. If qualified personnel become scarce or difficult to attract or retain in our industry for compensation-related or other reasons, we could experience higher labor, recruiting, or training costs. Further, new hires may require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, and they may not become as productive as we expect. The failure to attract, retain, and properly motivate members of our senior leadership team, to find suitable replacements for them in the event of death, illness, or their desire to pursue other professional opportunities, or to maintain our corporate culture as we continue to grow, could have a negative effect on our operating results.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Therefore, the barriers to our professionals pursuing independent business opportunities or joining our competitors should be considered low. Although our clients generally contract for services with us as a company, and not with an individual professional, in the event a professional leaves, such clients may decide they prefer to continue working with a specific professional rather than with us. Many of our written employment agreements with our senior leadership team and equivalent employees include non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. These restrictions have generally been drafted to comply with state “reasonableness” standards. However, certain jurisdictions may interpret restrictions on competition narrowly and in favor of employees.

Certain of our clients prefer fixed and other alternative fee arrangements, that place revenue ceilings or other limitations on our fee structure or may shift more of our revenue-generating potential to back-end contingent and success fee arrangements. With respect to such alternative fee arrangements, we may discount our rates initially, which could mean that the cost of providing services exceeds the fees that we collect during all or a portion of the term of the engagement. In such cases, failure to manage the engagement efficiently or collect the success or performance fees could expose us to a greater risk of loss on such engagement than other fee arrangements, or may cause variations in our revenues and operating results due to the timing of achievement of the performancebased criteria, if achieved at all.

Efforts to expand entail inherent risks. For example, there may be certain risks associated with innovation and competition from other participants in new geographies. In addition, we may fail to comply with uncertain evolving legal standards in new geographies that are applicable to certain of our service offerings, including those in the cybersecurity area. We may also face risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions, such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations that may impose different and, occasionally, conflicting or contradictory requirements. Such expansion may result in other risks which could adversely affect our business or our results of operations, including: - compliance with additional regulations and laws of other nations including employment laws, including immigration laws affecting the mobility of employees; - social, cultural, and language differences; - potential difficulty to maintain our collaborative culture and effective management controls; - losses related to start-up costs, lack of revenue, and higher costs due to low utilization; - currency fluctuations between the euro and other foreign currencies; - restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; - potentially adverse tax consequences and limitations on our ability to utilize losses generated in our foreign operations; - different regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business; - different or less stable political and economic environments; - greater personal security risks for employees traveling to or located in unstable locations; and - civil disturbances or other catastrophic events. Further, conducting business in other countries subjects us to increased regulatory compliance and oversight. A failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in regulatory enforcement actions as well as substantial civil and criminal penalties assessed against us and our employees. In addition, expanding into new geographic areas and expanding current service offerings is challenging and may require integrating new employees into our culture, as well as assessing the demand in the applicable market. If we cannot manage the risks associated with new service offerings or new locations effectively, we are unlikely to be successful in these efforts, which could harm our ability to sustain profitability and our business prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions.”_ We may, however, be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including any misjudgment of the key elements of an acquisition, competition among buyers, the high valuations of businesses in our industry, the need for regulatory and other approvals, lack of internal resources to actively pursue all attractive opportunities and availability of capital. When we do identify and complete acquisitions, we may face financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention and resources needed for existing operations, difficulty with integrating acquired businesses, acquiring business that are not consistent with our long-term strategies, integration of different corporate cultures, increased expenses, potential 40 ----- dilution of our brand, assumption of unknown liabilities, indemnities, potential disputes with the sellers and the need to evaluate the financial systems of, and establish internal controls for, acquired entities. Further, we seek out acquisitions of companies that maintain the same high-quality standards that we maintain, and if we misjudge or overestimate a company’s product quality standards, we may not be able to use these products or implement the strategies that were the primary reason for the acquisition, which would lead to a significant loss both financially and in time spent by our teams trying to integrate the product or implement the strategy. There can be no assurance that we will engage in any additional acquisitions nor that we will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits. In addition, our ability to realize the benefits we anticipate from our acquisition activities, including any anticipated sales growth, cost synergies, and other anticipated benefits, will depend in large part upon whether we are able to integrate such businesses efficiently and effectively. Integration is an ongoing process, and we may not be able to fully integrate such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may take longer than expected. Further, the integration of certain operations and the differences in operational culture following such activity will continue to require the dedication of significant management resources, which may distract management’s attention from day-to-day business operations. There may also be unasserted claims or assessments that we failed or were unable to discover or identify in the course of performing due diligence investigations of target businesses. If we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our business, we may be unable to realize the sales growth, cost synergies, and other anticipated benefits of such transactions, and our business, results of operations, and cash flow could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud-, and securityrelated offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as developments in areas such as network automation, 5G, IoT, digital twin, blockchain, augmented reality/virtual reality and other emerging technologies. 41 ----- Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements, and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing models that reflect the value of these technological developments, or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall. Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, could also shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected. We operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants. New services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to competitively use innovative or technologically advanced software and products to provide our services, and anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients, we could be unable to retain clients, grow our business and capitalize on market opportunities, which would adversely affect our operating margins and financial results.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the increased use of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services in recent years, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases. Such breaches and cyberattacks could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data of, among others, our employees, clients, contractors, vendors, and other business partners, as well as personal data stored on our products or through our services by our clients, which may result in damage to our reputation and brand and adversely affect our relationships with our clients. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving and have increased in sophistication and speed in recent years, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on one of our clients and its clients. The risk of such attacks includes breaches and attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also of those of our clients, employees, contractors, business partners, vendors, and other third parties, as well as of third-party systems on which we rely to operate our digital platforms. Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of our data or systems or those of our clients or other third parties, theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means, and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. Furthermore, certain industries in which our clients operate, including the healthcare and finance industries, require heightened standards for the handling of sensitive data and can be subject to regulatory overview, which can result in an increase in our compliance expenses and negative publicity for our products and services in case of a breach or attempted breach. In the event of such actions, we, our clients, and other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as to the loss of existing or potential clients, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. We also experience and respond to cybersecurity threats from time to time. As our business and the cybersecurity landscape evolve, we may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. However, there can be no assurance that such investments will prevent future cyberattacks or other threats from occurring which may result in material adverse effects on our business and operations. In addition, the trend to publicize vulnerabilities discovered in our industry increases the risks posed by these attacks and the potential costs that we, our partners and/or our clients might have to incur to respond and remediate to any of such attacks.

We also enter into proprietary information and intellectual property agreements with employees, which require them to disclose any invention created during employment, to convey such rights to inventions to us, and to restrict any disclosure of proprietary information. In addition, our employment contracts generally require our employees to convey to us rights to any inventions created during their employment and restrict employees from disclosing proprietary information. Trade secrets are generally difficult to protect. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection 43 ----- may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or the infringement of our patents and copyrights. From time to time, our trademarks are challenged by third parties who may allege infringement with their own intellectual property rights or that our trademarks could generate confusion among the public.

Further, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to adequately protect, maintain, or enforce our intellectual property rights may adversely limit our competitive position. In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties (including competitors as well as non-practicing holders of intellectual property assets), and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Furthermore, we may not be aware if our employees have misappropriated and/or misused intellectual property, and their actions could result in claims of intellectual property misappropriation and/or infringement from third parties. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time. In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients. If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we are unable to implement in a cost-effective manner alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients. Any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend, or could lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us. Further, we rely on third-party software to provide some of our services and solutions. If we lose our ability to continue using any such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the rapidly spreading COVID-19 outbreak was a global pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments around the world have implemented, and continue to implement, a variety of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions and bans, social distancing requirements for both individuals and businesses, shelter-in-place and lockdown orders and required closures of non-essential businesses. The various lockdowns in the 12 countries in which we operate have directly impacted our clients. On a global scale, due to the shutdown of businesses across the industries in which we operate, clients have delayed projects, decreased their scope, and in some cases, cancelled them all together. Uncertainty about the lifting of lockdowns and the return of business activity, as well as the possibility of future lockdown measures, could lead to lower demand from our clients, and we cannot provide assurance that the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic or any resurgence or outbreak of other contagious diseases will not have a material adverse effect on our operations. The circumstances of the COVID-19 outbreak are continuing to change rapidly, and we are unable to reasonably estimate the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results and liquidity, as well as operations. Future developments of the COVID-19 pandemic could give rise to circumstances that result in one or more of the following: - we could lose key clients, clients could become insolvent or we could have a reduction or volatility in demand for our consulting services, which may be caused by, among other things: decreased demand as a result of travel restrictions and bans, social distancing requirements for both individuals and businesses, shelter-in-place and lockdown orders, and required closures of non-essential businesses; - confidence in the markets in which we operate could be undermined, leading to clients reducing, delaying, or eliminating spending for our services; 44 ----- - the markets that we serve may grow at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time; - cancellation, stoppage, delay or decline in the number and size of merger and acquisition (“M&A”) transactions, litigation and governmental and regulatory proceedings, antitrust and competition matters, or other types of investigations and matters on which we advise; - we could be subject to changes in laws and governmental regulations that adversely affect our business and operations; - the third parties on which we rely and independent contractors, may fail to meet their obligations to us, or may face significant disruptions in their ability to do so; - we could be subject to adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates; - we might lose key management and operating personnel; - we may face higher employee ancillary costs, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees; - we may be impacted by government budget constraints, tax constraints, or government shutdowns; - our access to capital markets may be restricted, which could adversely affect our short-term liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations, including those under the Notes; - we may be impacted by deterioration in the global credit, financial and economic environment, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows; - we may be subject to increased information technology (“IT”) security threats and reduced network access availability; - our operations or the operations of our principal clients could be designated as non-essential across our key markets; - we may experience a disruption or delay in executing our strategic capital initiatives due to travel restrictions and/or health and safety concerns.

The GDPR obligates European Union-based companies or companies that process personal data about European Union subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate, for example, to, (i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security and confidentiality; (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability); (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing; (iv) the rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, a right of access, the right to rectification, and the right to erasure, and (v) and (v) mandatory data breach notifications to the supervisory authorities and, in certain cases, the affected individuals. The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies, or types of data. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in significant penalties including fines of up to 4% of total annual worldwide turnover or €20.0 million (whichever is higher), depending on the type and severity of the breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease processing). Our data security insurance coverage may be limited and we cannot guarantee that our data security insurance coverage or our general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data security systems. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any applicable data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings, investigations, or other actions (including class actions) brought against us by governmental entities and agencies or private individuals and entities, which may result in significant fines, penalties, judgments, and reputational damages to our business, and require us to change business practices and increase the costs and complexity of compliance, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, evolving regulation relating to privacy, information security, and data protection could increase our costs and affect or limit the way through which we collect, process, use, store, and transfer personal data. Compliance with, and monitoring such laws and regulations is demanding, time consuming, and costly. Further, such laws and regulations, including their interpretation and application, change from time to time, and such changes could impose new burdens and expose us to further liability, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, in the aftermath of temporary personnel initiatives implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as a reliance on remote working, as well as an increased amount of employee health data being processed, our exposure to this risk is temporarily heightened. The increased emphasis on information security and the requirements to comply with applicable data security and privacy laws and regulations has increased, and is expected to continue to increase, our related costs of doing business and could negatively impact our financial results. Any failure to comply with the applicable regulations, could result in fines, enforcement actions by governments or competent authorities, injunctions or other measures which could result in reputational harm, reduced market share and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The amount of ROL not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income can be carried forward, increasing the amount of ROL for the following five fiscal years. Interest expense not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years, provided that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income is lower than 30% of ROL.

In particular, the Italian Revenue Agency confirmed as a general principle that LBO transactions are generally based on sound economic reasons considering that the financing from third party lenders is usually conditional on acquisition of control over the target company by a special purpose vehicle and the following merger with debt push down. As a result of such guidance, LBO transactions are generally not considered irregular for tax purposes absent specific circumstances in which the tax authorities contend that the structuring of any such transaction was designed to obtain unlawful tax advantages in violation of the law or established legal principles (e.g., re-leveraged transactions without a change of control).

Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code is the central provision in the Italian legislation regulating merger debt push-downs (thus its application constitutes a safeharbor vis-à-vis the risk that any such merger can be considered unlawful, also from a financial assistance perspective, with ensuing consequences). In order to complete the Merger, there are various steps that we must take, including the preparation of a merger plan, a report by the directors of the companies involved in the Merger (relazione dell’organo amministrativo) and a report by an independent expert appointed by the court, assessing the sustainability of debt at the level of Mergerco. Our estimate of the timing required to complete the Merger is based upon market practice for leveraged buyouts in Italy, which typically involve acquisition vehicles in the form of joint stock companies (società per azioni) where an independent expert is required to be appointed by the competent court, which creates an inherent uncertainty as to the length of time in which the Merger can be expected to take place. In addition, there can be no assurance that the independent expert will release its report or that the other steps required for the Merger will 54 ----- be taken in a timely manner, or at all. Subject to certain exceptions, the Merger can only be implemented following the expiration of 60 days after the latest filing with the competent companies’ registry of the resolutions approving the Merger. Within this 60-day deadline, the creditors of the companies involved in the Merger is entitled to challenge the Merger. Moreover, pursuant to the applicable “golden power” legislation, the Merger may be subject to a new filing with the Italian Council of Ministries and the obtainment of the relevant clearance will be subject to a simplified procedure being an extraordinary transaction implemented by companies belonging to the same group. Following the Merger, in the event that BIP is the successor company of the Merger, Mergerco will, upon consummation of the Merger, assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture. Although as of the date of this Offering Memorandum we expect that BIP will be the surviving entity of the Merger, if the Merger are ultimately structured such that BIP is not the surviving entity, or if there is a new resulting entity, then BIP will be required to transfer licenses and permits relating to the conduct of its business operations to the new entity resulting from the Merger. There is no assurance that in such event BIP will be able to transfer its licenses or permits in a timely manner, or at all, or that our business may not be materially adversely affected as a result. Concurrently with the Merger, certain Note Collateral will be extinguished by operation of law and, in particular, in the event that BIP is the successor company of the Merger, the share pledge over the shares of the Issuer will be extinguished by operation of law. In addition, subject to and on terms consistent with the Agreed Security Principles, 20 business days following completion of the Merger, Mergerco will grant (or reconfirm, as applicable) and Midco will reconfirm the security interests in the Post-Merger Collateral.

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral. See “Description of the Notes—Security— _Release of Liens.” Not all of our assets secure the Notes, and the Indenture allows the Issuer and its restricted_ subsidiaries to secure certain future indebtedness permitted to be incurred with certain property and assets that do not secure the Notes. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Notes Guarantee thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Notes Collateral securing the Notes. The claims of secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. 55 ----- The value of the Notes Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Notes Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Notes Collateral in an orderly sale, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the condition of the Italian economy and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Notes Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Notes Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Notes Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, (i) the pledges, shares and ownership interests of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding because all of the obligations of the entity must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the entity and (ii) the total amount secured under the Notes Collateral is not linked to the market value of the underlying assets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could materially adversely affect the value of the Notes Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Notes Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions (including the laws of Italy). If the proceeds of any sale of the Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, investors in the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Notes Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Notes Collateral or any intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Notes Collateral. In addition, the Notes Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. The Notes Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. In addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Notes Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, due consideration should be given by investors to the circumstance that enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Italy may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In addition, our business requires a variety of licenses. Our continued operation depends on the maintenance of such licenses. Under some of our licenses, public authorities impose restrictions on the transfers of the ownership of the license holder, including a change of control clause, which prohibits the transfer of the ownership of the license holder without the prior approval of the authority. In the event of an enforcement action under the terms of the Notes which results in the transfer of ownership of the Issuer or its subsidiaries, or a change in the shareholding of the Group for other reasons, the authorities may attempt to cancel our licenses. In addition, the uncertainty concerning the transferability of such licenses themselves could significantly reduce the value placed on the licenses by third parties and ultimately reduce the amount recovered in the event of an enforcement action. The applicable governmental authorities may not consent to the transfer of any of such licenses. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

As the Notes will be issued by the Issuer, an enforcement over the shares of the Issuer would involve the enforcement over the share pledge of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In 56 ----- addition, the Indenture will not prohibit the Issuer from incurring additional debt claims in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the Issuer’s debt obligations, which could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the value of the pledge over the shares of the Issuer may be limited. In addition, the Notes Collateral includes, inter alia, a security interest over the shares of each of the Issuer, Targets and Mergerco. To the extent the enforcement of this security interest would result in an acquisition of a holding in the Issuer, the Targets or Mergerco, any such enforcement would require clearance by the Italian Government, pursuant to the applicable Italian “golden power” legislation.

However, the obligations of each Guarantor, the enforcement of a Notes Guarantee and the obligations of the grantor of security and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce on the Notes Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor or provided by the relevant grantor of security under the applicable laws of Italy, which has been determined so as to ensure that amounts payable will not result in violations of laws related to, among others, corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or transactions under value, or otherwise cause the relevant Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under applicable law or such Notes Guarantee to be deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of such Guarantor to be held in breach of applicable corporate or commercial law for providing such Notes Guarantee. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Collateral and any _Future Notes Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Accordingly, enforcement of any such Notes Guarantee or Notes Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or security provider would be subject to certain defenses available to the relevant Guarantors or security provider generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Notes Guarantees or pledge of security designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors or security providers. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency, voidable preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulation or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, the liability of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee or of a security provider could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the amounts of its other obligations and the law applicable to it.

It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or a creditor of a Guarantor or a security provider, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor or a security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee or security interest on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Notes Guarantee or pledge should be limited or voided. In the event that any Guarantee or security interest is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent such limitations on the Notes Guarantee or security obligation apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider to the extent of such limitations. Future pledges or guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. 59 ----- Additionally, the grant of Notes Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest. Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even if such claims are secured claims.

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Notes Collateral may be restricted by Italian law.,"The security interests in the Notes Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Notes Collateral are taken, including the Republic of Italy. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including the Republic of Italy). In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable as Italian law does not provide for such a construct. All or part of the pledges and other security interests in jurisdictions utilizing the Parallel Debt construct will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law, and to the extent that the security interests in the Notes Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Notes Collateral. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Collateral and any Future Notes _Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Moreover, in Italy the Notes Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interests and guarantees by a 60 ----- _rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf_ of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Notes Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void.

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Although we currently intend to hedge the interest rate with respect to the Notes, we may not be able to obtain such hedges, or replace such hedges, on terms that are acceptable to us, and any such hedge may not be fully effective, which would expose us to interest rate risk.

This means that interest on the Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Notes issued on the Issue Date. See “Description of the Notes—Principal and Maturity” and “Description of the Notes—Interest.” The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Indenture) without the consent of the holders of the Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt, including the Notes. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the interest rate on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, holders of the Notes may in certain circumstances require us to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the purchase date.

Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when our subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer, our subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes.

See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes, respectively, in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of “change of control” contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

As set forth in “Description of the Notes—Meeting of Noteholders,” the majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of the Notes will be one or more persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders of the Notes, including holders of the Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of the Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes, to change the quorum requirements relating to meetings, to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and/or to change the amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of Notes and may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes. Under Italian law, the approval of an extraordinary resolution typically requires the consent of more than one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Our decision to increase the majority requirement is untested under Italian law, may be challenged by holders of the Notes, the Issuer and others, and if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian court, with the consequence being that the majority voting threshold may be reduced from 75% to 50%.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

All payments made by the Issuer or on its behalf in respect of the Notes will be made free and clear of withholding or deduction of Italian taxation, unless the withholding or deduction is required by law. In that event, subject to a number of exceptions, the Issuer or the Guarantors will pay such additional amounts that may result in the holders of the Notes receiving such amounts that they would have received in regards to such Notes had no such withholding or deduction been required. The Issuer and the Guarantors are not liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes in certain circumstances, including if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Decree No. 239 or pursuant to Decree No. 461 (except where the procedures required under Decree No. 239 or under Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption have not been complied with due solely to the actions or omissions by the Issuer or its agents). In those circumstances, investors will receive the proceeds of their investment in the Notes, net of applicable withholding or deductions. In particular, holders of Notes that are not residents in White List countries, holders who are residents in White List countries that do not properly and promptly satisfy the required conditions and procedures set forth by Decree No. 239 (and by the relevant application rules to benefit from exemption from Italian taxation), and 66 ----- certain categories of holders of the Notes who are residents in Italy, will therefore only receive the net proceeds of their investment in the Notes and will not be paid any additional amounts to compensate them for the withholding or deduction.

No assurance can be given that all non-Italian resident investors will be eligible for the withholding tax exemption where the relevant foreign intermediary fails to provide sufficient information to the relevant Italian tax authorities under the procedures for applying the exemption regime.

If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes by US Holders (as defined in “Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations.” Despite the measures taken by countries in the Eurozone to alleviate credit risk, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political 67 ----- circumstances in individual Eurozone member states. These and other concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more member states, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time.

The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (for example, to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (for example, payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the bankruptcy receiver must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any clawback action.

(“BEEP”), which acquired the entire shareholding of BIP S.p.A., and subsequently BEEP was merged with and into BIP.

We were established in 2003 as a result of a spin-off from Deloitte Consulting Italia. As of June 30, 2021, we had 3,641 employees. Our professional team includes 36 equity partners (the “Equity Partners”) and 111 partners, directors, associate partners, client partners and competence partners. Since we were established, we have expanded our geographic reach to 12 countries with 16 offices through our strong organic growth of approximately 16.7% per annum from 2004 to 2020 (in particular, we maintained organic growth during the financial crisis from 2008 to 2012 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020) and selective accretive acquisitions. We provide a wide range of advisory solutions and services to enterprise clients, including business advisory, strategy and innovation, technological advisory, digital advisory, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, digital twin, blockchain, data and analytics and digital delivery. Recognizing the importance of technological advances and digital transformation for clients and businesses, we were early to establish our innovation practice in 2009 and digital practice in 2013. The growing importance of technological advances and digital transformation to our clients combined with our in-depth industry specific knowledge and technological and digital competencies, have resulted in approximately 64% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 being related to digital transformation projects. We generated approximately 68.4% of our revenues in Italy for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Our other principal geographies include Brazil, the UK, Spain, Switzerland, the USA, and Colombia. In addition, we operate in other countries including Chile, Turkey, Austria, Belgium, and the UAE. We operate across several sectors of the economy with industry-specific knowledge supported by our technology and digital innovation competencies. Our key industries include (i) Energy & Utilities, (ii) Telecommunication, Media & Entertainment (“TMT”), (iii) Financial Services, (iv) Public Sector & Healthcare, (v) Manufacturing, (vi) Retail, (the “Reference Industries”) as well as (vii) Transportation. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated revenues of €330.7 million, Adjusted EBITDA of €61.5 million (representing an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 18.6%) and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €62.3 million. We also have a strong pipeline of ongoing projects, with a total Backlog as of June 30, 2021 of €134.8 million (compared to €81.8 million as of June 30, 2020), of which we expect €117.0 million to be converted into revenue in 2021. Our cash conversion rate (calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures divided by Adjusted EBITDA) was 93% over the same period. 76 ----- The charts below set forth our revenue by industry and geography for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and by service area for the year ended December 31, 2020:",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

According to Source Global Research, our addressable market, which includes the Reference Industries in Italy, the UK, Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, other South America, the USA and the Middle East (“Reference Geographic Market,” together with the Reference Industries, the “Reference Market”) was estimated to be valued at approximately $58.0 billion in annual global sales in 2020, having grown at a CAGR of approximately 6% between 2018 and 2019. The market has been temporarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and is expected to rebound from 2021 and grow at a CAGR of 12.5% between 2020 and 2024. We have consistently out-performed the Reference Market, including during the COVID-19 pandemic reporting 7% organic growth in terms of revenues between 2019 and 2020. Our Reference Market benefits from strong ongoing digitalization trends across the public and private sectors and changes in operating models of companies and clients, further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, driving the need of specialized external consulting resources and increasing spending on transformation projects. Our wide range of end to end solutions, with distinctive digital capabilities, coupled with in-depth specific industry know-how and long-lasting relationships with our clients and partners, position us effectively to capitalize on the strong growth in demand for consulting services across our main industry verticals. Our clients include more than 600 private and blue chip companies, as well as public sector organizations, comprising Energy & Utilities companies (including Gruppo Enel, BP (British Petroleum), Gruppo Eni, Gruppo ACEA, Gruppo A2A, Enagas, Naturgy, Petrobras, Repsol and Snam), TMT companies (including Sky, Telecom Italia, Fastweb, and Teamsystem), Italian and European Financial Services institutions (including Allianz, UniCredit, Gruppo Generali, Gruppo BNP Paribas, ICCREA, AGOS, Nexi, Santander, UBS, and Visa), Public Sector organizations (including Poste Italiane, Banca d’Italia, the Istituto Nazionale Previdenza Sociale (INPS), the Italian Ministry of Justice (Ministero della Giustizia), and the Home Office (UK)), Healthcare companies (including Pfizer, GE healthcare, Novartis, Astrazeneca, Roche and Sanofi), Manufacturing companies (including Amplifon, Barilla, Leonardo and Daimler), Retail business (including Esselunga, Kering, and Luxottica), and Transportation companies (including ENAV). We aim to create long-term, strategic relationships with our clients, and to be an integral part of our clients’ business development and strategy implementation, focusing on value added projects that are normally related to recurring capital expenditures with lower renewal risk. Historically, we have been able to achieve long-lasting client relationships by providing a broad services offering covering our clients’ needs, including significantly customized and highly specialized services, as well as delivering consistent high-quality services. As of June 30, 2021, we had an average client relationship tenure of approximately 18 years for our top 10 clients and approximately nine years for our top 11 to top 20 clients. We have a low client concentration across all of our industry verticals, with no client accounting for more than 7.5% of our revenues and no industry vertical accounting for more than 27.7% of our revenues for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our top 10 clients generated approximately 33.3% of our revenues. Our ability to deliver value to our clients is a result of the character and expertise of our people. We rely on an entrepreneurial and committed leadership team of 36 Equity Partners, 111 partners, directors, associate partners, client partners and competence partners, and an experienced team of 257 senior managers and principals, who are supported by a talented pool of 3,237 other employees as of June 30, 2021. We combine core consulting skills 77 ----- and industry know-how with digital expertise in areas such as data and analytics, cybersecurity, customer relationship management (“CRM”) and digital delivery, cloud and artificial intelligence and automation, all fostered by a culture of innovation that extends to all reaches of our company. Historically, we have devoted significant resources to attract, train, develop, and retain our people. As a result, our workforce has grown from approximately 2,200 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 3,641 as of June 30, 2021, of which approximately 28% is based outside of Italy, driven by the increase of our digital practice as well as our internationalization, coupled with what we believe is best in class talent retention policies. We believe our business model has allowed us to quickly respond to our clients’ needs and continue to efficiently operate our business during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, during the periods of lockdown in Italy, Spain, Brazil and the UK, we were able to continue to ensure business continuity and service our clients, while safeguarding the health and safety of our employees. We successfully transitioned substantially all of our employees to remote working over a short period of time, maintaining high levels of service and assisting our clients with their responses to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of €286.2 million, compared to €242.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 representing an increase in revenues of 17.9%, of which approximately 7% was organic compared to an estimated approximately 13% decrease for the overall global consulting market.

We have expanded our international footprint, industry, and digital competencies through the acquisition of three companies: Openknowledge, Sketchin Italia S.r.l., and Anagram Consulting Partners (“Anagram”). Since 2019, we further expanded our footprint and industry, and digital competencies through: acquiring a controlling stake in FBM Group (“FBM”), the acquisition of MeA Consulting, Vidiemme Consulting S.r.l. (“Vidiemme”), Chaucer Group (“Chaucer”), Medley Business Solutions (“Medley”) and Advantis Consultoria Gerencial S.A.S. (“Advantis”), as well as through hiring 24 employees from KPMG Spain to support our office in Madrid. For more information, see “—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Our Operations— _Acquisitions.”_ Through our acquisition of FBM, in which we acquired a controlling stake, we expanded our reach in the Brazilian Financial Services market. Our acquisition of MeA Consulting, a boutique consulting firm with deep industrial knowledge, allowed us to increase our presence in the Manufacturing industry. In addition, our acquisitions of Vidiemme, a Milan-based consulting company, has allowed us to improve our offerings in digital delivery. Our acquisition of Chaucer, a UK-based consulting company focused on delivering sustainable change for clients through digital transformation, increased our presence in the UK, primarily in the Energy & Utilities, and Public Sector & Healthcare industries. Our acquisition of Medley, an information and technology consultancy service that operates primarily in the public sector industry in the UK, further deepened our expertise in the public sector. We believe our historical acquisition strategy has allowed us to successfully increase our number of clients, expand to new markets as well as greater geographic areas, and improve product and service offerings, creating opportunities to cross-sell services to existing and new clients. As a result of integrating acquired businesses into our existing businesses, we have and may continue to experience an increase in operating expenses, such as staff costs, distribution costs, or other expenditures. Moreover, our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired sites or business in our consolidated results from the date of their combination or acquisition, but the full impact of a business combination or acquisition is typically only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period as synergies and cost savings begin to be realized. In the future, we intend to continue to grow our business in part through acquisitions to solidify our current market position, expand into new geographies, add complimentary technology or capabilities to our business, and enlarge our client base as further detailed under “Summary—Our Strategy.” We have and may in the future incur certain amounts of indebtedness as a result of such acquisitions. Our indebtedness will increase our interest expense and may impact the rating of our indebtedness. Our indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning 78 ----- for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future business opportunities, since a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness, and this may place us at a competitive disadvantage as some of our competitors are less leveraged.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540
630_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.3.2,Industry verticals,"We monitor our results across seven industry verticals: (i) Energy & Utilities; (ii) Telecommunications, Media & Entertainment (“TMT”); (iii) Financial Services; (iv) Public Sector & Healthcare; (v) Manufacturing; (vi) Retail; and (vii) Transportation. Revenue generation in each industry vertical is characterized both by industry vertical-specific demand drivers as well as, especially in recent years, an increased demand for digital transformation products and services. In Energy & Utilities, demand for our services is driven by a push for increased modernization of infrastructure and networks. The energy value chain sits at a crossroads of systemic challenges: from decarbonization to electrification, from digitalization to operational excellence, from urbanization to client centricity, and from sustainable capital disciplines to circular economy. We are on the front line of these challenges, working with our clients to help them evolve their business models, including through digital strategy and innovation, as well as modernization of business processes through task automation, process re-engineering, and supporting our clients with the design and implementation of appropriate applications and solutions. The proportion of revenues from Energy & Utilities relative to the other industry verticals has increased in the past years and in 2020, Energy & Utility was the largest revenue contributor. We generated approximately 25.7%, 27.5%, and 28.2% of our revenues from Energy & Utilities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. In TMT, demand for our services is driven by increased client investments in network function virtualization, cloud, 5G, and the related demand for cyber defense owing to the increasing complexity and risks of these new architectures, as well as digitization of business processes and services through automation, analytics, artificial intelligence, and CRM systems, among others, digital workplace (also supporting also remote working), and professional/technical support services. Our expertise in the field of business transformation for the digital age has made us the first choice partner for our clients. We historically generated higher revenues through TMT. We generated approximately 32.2%, 28.3%, and 23.7% of our revenues from TMT for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, which was driven by the increase of incidence of other industries, such as Energy & Utilities, Public Sector and Healthcare, due to higher demand of services related to energy market and to acquisition of several projects for financial institutions, related to the implementation of digital solutions and artificial intelligence. In Financial Services, demand for our services is primarily driven by our clients’ increased focus and investment in the innovation of digital transformation, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity which has resulted in clients requiring our support to exploit digital innovation to increase revenue, reduce operating costs, make IT infrastructure more efficient, create new business opportunities through open innovation, and implement more effective working methods, involving cultural change and increased digital acumen. We historically generated higher revenues through Financial Services. We generated approximately 21.1%, 21.6%, and 22.0% of our revenues from Financial Services for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. This increase was mainly due to higher demand for services related to digital solutions, artificial intelligence services, and cybersecurity from financial institutions. In Public Sector & Healthcare, demand for our services is primarily driven by processes and services digitization (e.g., digital citizen engagement, web sites, custom applications, and electronic medical records, which has accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the EU recovery fund), cloud transformation and infrastructure outsourcing, data center consolidation initiatives, and digital workplace (supporting also remote working). We have historically generated lower revenues through Public Sector & Healthcare, but have expanded our reach in this vertical through acquisitions such as Chaucer and Medley, and aim to continue to expand our presence. We generated approximately 8.8%, 10.5%, and 12.9% of our revenues from Public Sector & Healthcare for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. In Manufacturing, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by clients’ investments in redesigning data center infrastructures, adopting cloud services and artificial intelligence technologies, and improving internal processes, and our clients require our support to make this shift. We generated approximately 4.2%, 5.9%, and 4.4% of our revenues from Manufacturing for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. In Retail, demand for our products and services is primarily driven by our clients’ migration to the cloud, redesign of client interactions, artificial intelligence initiatives to optimize supply chains and client interactions, 79 ----- and the support required to make this transition. We historically generated lower revenues through Retail. We generated 3.8%, 3.9%, and 5.1% of our revenues from Retail for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. In Transportation, demand for our services is primarily driven by processes and services digitization, technological developments, changes in regulations, as well as the push towards sustainability, and our clients need for assistance navigating these changes as well as the tools to embrace digital innovation. We have historically generated lower revenues in the Transportation industry compared to our other verticals. We generated 4.2%, 2.2%, and 1.9% of our revenues from Transportation for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. The decrease in revenues from 2018 to 2020 was due to the lifecycle of certain multi-year projects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540
630_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.3.3,Macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Changes in the macroeconomic environment of our key geographic markets, which include Italy and other European countries such as the UK, Spain, France, and Germany, have an impact on our results of our operations. For the financial year ended December 31, 2020, 74.4% of our revenues were derived from our operations in Italy. As a result, macroeconomic conditions, market trends, and client demands in Italy, in particular, have an impact on our results of operations, though our revenues have historically remained resilient through volatile macroeconomic cycles. Overall economic growth in Italy has been slow since the end of the 2009/2010 financial crisis and the subsequent Eurozone banking crisis. Between 2018 and 2019, the Italian consulting market grew at a CAGR of approximately 7.0% and was estimated to be valued at approximately €4.6 billion in 2020, according to Assoconsult. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian economy contracted sharply during the first quarter of 2020, recording a year-on-year contraction in GDP of 5.3%, followed by a 12.8% year-on-year decrease in the second quarter of 2020, which was the worst year-on-year decrease of GDP since records began in 1995 as the country was one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to ISTAT. The Italian consulting market was directly impacted and experienced a decrease of approximately 4.2% in 2020, according to Assoconsult. In 2021, the Italian consulting market is expected to increase by approximately 8.5%, driven by client demand for: (i) digital projects involving artificial intelligence solutions, CRM, cloud services, IoT, as well as cybersecurity tools and services; and (ii) green projects such as developing and implementing sustainability strategies and plans to achieve greater corporate social responsibility. In addition, growth of the Italian consulting market is expected to further benefit from the structural under penetration of consulting spend in Italy, according to Assoconsult. We cannot predict the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, we believe we have demonstrated continued resilience in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the initial decrease in demand for our services during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenues were €286.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €43.4 million, or 17.9% compared to €242.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic where clients were required to shift to remote working, relying on IT infrastructures and systems and cloud-based solutions to run their operations, there was an increase in client demand for digital transformation processes across all of our industry verticals, in particular Energy & Utilities, TMT, and Financial Services. As a result, we experienced an increased demand for our services, which positively impacted our revenues in Digital and innovation consulting, which was €71.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 50.0%, compared to €47.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019.

Key megatrends include: (i) fast changing client needs and behaviors; (ii) the growing importance of environmental, social, and governance factors; (iii) disruptive, digital startups challenging market incumbents; (iv) increasing adoption of digital technology, artificial intelligence, and machine learning; and (v) increased cybersecurity risks. Clients rely on external consultants with specialist expertize to help them navigate complex, ever-changing environmental and technological developments. During the periods under review, the demand for digitalization and digital transformation has become a key concern for business leaders across all of our industry verticals. This trend is driven by a number of factors including, for example: (i) increased awareness of environmental issues which companies are addressing with technology-based solutions such as electrical mobility in the Energy & Utilities industry; (ii) an increased adoption of digital technologies and digital processes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, where clients were 80 ----- required to shift to remote working, relying on IT infrastructures and systems and cloud-based solutions to run their operations; and (iii) the introduction of regulatory changes aimed at increasing the use of digital solutions in European countries. For example, in Italy, the government and regulators have implemented policies that favor digitalization through IT investments, such as the Industry 4.0 plan and the National Plan for Innovation 2025. Moreover, under the RRP, the EU allocated approximately €235.0 billion between 2021 and 2026 for a reform agenda and investment program encompassing six policy areas or “missions” in Italy, of which approximately €50.0 billion is expected to be invested in the “digitalization, innovation, competitiveness, and culture” mission in Italy. We believe that our innovative and digital-focused practice, deep industry experience, and proven innovative capabilities will provide us with the opportunity to benefit from these governmental and regulatory changes. We work closely to follow demand trends. We have invested in, and will continue to invest in, building our digital and technological competencies. Our digital practice offering, which was founded in 2013, is vast and includes: (i) implementing data and analytics solutions; (ii) facilitating the adoption of resilient cybersecurity technology; (iii) assisting with client relationship management by developing an integrated solution, including methodologies, software, and processes, to manage and analyze client relationships and interactions; and (iv) providing support with cloud services, artificial intelligence, and automation.

Since we consolidate the results of operations of each acquired business in our financial statements from the completion date of each acquisition our historical financial periods are not directly comparable to one another. Following the closing date of an acquisition, our results are consolidated with the results of the acquired business, and are thereafter impacted by the revenues and expenses of the acquired business. In addition, our results are affected by other items such as (i) our ability to realize synergies; (ii) the integration of selling, general, and administrative functions such as sales, marketing, finance, human resources, information technology, and management; and (iii) any costs we incur to realize synergies and similar items. As a result of our acquisitions, our financial statements in the future may vary from the historical consolidated financial statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. As a result, the purchase price for the acquired business is allocated to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over these allocations is assigned to goodwill, which is not amortized for accounting purposes but is subject to testing for impairment at least annually. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired in the acquisition may result in an increase in amortization and depreciation expense because we will record the fair value of the acquired intangible assets and adjust the book value of the acquired tangible assets to their fair value. We evaluate the remaining depreciable lives of the tangible assets to reflect the estimated useful lives for purposes of calculating periodic depreciation, and we will amortize the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. We will also review the value of the inventory and will adjust it to fair value, which may change the costs and expenses recognized by us upon the sale of this acquired inventory. 81 ----- We believe that the historical acquisitions we have made in the periods under review have generated synergies for our business and have contributed to our growth. In addition, such acquisitions have allowed us greater reach in new geographies, deeper access to industries in which we currently operate, as well as the opportunity to expand in those where we are underrepresented, and the ability to enhance our services, for example, improved digital competencies, as a result of acquiring new services.

IFRS 15 provides for the recognition of revenues for an amount reflecting the remuneration the party deems it is entitled to, in return for the transfer of goods and services to the client. In addition, any variable amounts that the Company owes to clients, whether those amounts are direct or indirect, are recognized to reduce revenue. Hence, revenue is recognized when a performance obligation to the client has been fulfilled and when the amount due to the party providing the goods or services can be reliably determined. A performance obligation is deemed to be fulfilled when each parties’ rights regarding the goods and services is transferred. Revenue is shown net of any return, discount, bonus, and allowance, as well as any directly related tax. With respect to a work in progress, when the outcome of a specific contract can be estimated reliably, the performance of the company does not create an asset of alternative use to the company and it has the enforceable right to be paid for the services completed up to that date. Revenue and expenses attributable to the related contract are recognized as expenses respectively in relation to the stage of completion of the activity at the reporting date, based on the ratio of costs incurred for work performed to date to the estimated total contract costs, unless it is not considered representative of the stage of completion of the contract. When the outcome of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, contract revenue is recognized only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are expected to be recovered. Contract costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed contract revenue, the expected loss is recognized as an expense immediately. Advances paid by clients are deducted from inventories to the extent of the amounts accrued; any excess is recognized as a liability. Changes to the contract, price revisions and incentives are recognized to the extent that they have been agreed with the client. Costs are recognized on an accrual basis and are directly related to the provision of services. Costs incurred in relation to the acquisition of new knowledge or discoveries, the study of alternative products or processes, new techniques or models, the design and construction of prototypes or, in any case, costs incurred for other scientific research or technological development activities are generally considered current costs and are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Interest is recognized at the effective interest rate on an accrual basis. Our revenues from sales and services are categorized by: (a) Geography: the geographical area of the client destination: Italy, Other European Countries, South America, North America, and Rest of the World; (b) Service Areas: strategy and operation consulting, technology consulting, and digital and innovation consulting; and (c) Industry: the industries in which our clients operate, including: - Energy & Utilities; - Telecommunications, Media & Entertainment; - Financial Services; - Public Sector & Healthcare; - Manufacturing; - Retail; and - Transportation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The increase was primarily driven by an increase of €0.6 million related to Sketchin’s digital and innovation consulting projects, as well as an increase in revenue from BIP UAE, Advantis and Anagram amounting to €0.2 million. Such impact was partially offset by a decrease in BIP of €0.4 million, driven by a reduction in technology consulting services of €1.6 million partially reduced by a €1.2 million increase in strategy & operation and digital & innovation consulting services.

This increase was primarily attributable to: (i) Chaucer acquisition which contributed revenues of €11.7 million; (ii) Medley which contributed revenues of €4.1 million and (iii) BIP with an increase of €1.6 million in comparison to the six months ended June 30,2020, driven by the provision of digital transformation and artificial intelligence services for public companies and central and local authorities. Revenues from Manufacturing amounted to €8.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of €1.4 million, or 19.1%, compared to €7.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020.

This increase was primarily driven by: (i) the inclusion of Chaucer into our corporate structure on the consolidation date in July 2020, contributing approximately €3.9 million; and (ii) the growth of our business, which was primarily due to strategic, energy related projects focusing on the use of hydrogen for energy transportation led by BIP, resulting in an increase in revenues related to the Energy & Utilities industry from €53.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019 to €59.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020. Revenues from TMT amounted to €67.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €1.0 million, or 1.4%, compared to €68.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. The TMT industry was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in 2020, revenues in the TMT industry in Italy, our primary geographic market, decreased by 5%. In addition, while telecommunication companies experienced a large increase in fixed and mobile traffic volumes, the impact on the media sector was mix and included: (i) a decrease in turnover of free-to-air TV by 11%, an slight increase in pay-TV (primarily driven by new streaming subscriptions), and an increase by 7% of revenues from digital advertising on the internet. We remained relatively resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic, with revenues substantially in line with the previous year. Our resilience was in part due to the acceleration of digital transformation across all industries, with a strong push towards cloud computing and e-commerce. As a result, the demand for cybersecurity services also increased due to the dramatic shift to remote working environments. Revenues from Financial Services amounted to €62.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €10.5 million, or 20.0%, compared to €52.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by: (i) clients in the Italian financial sector increasing their use of digital solutions, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity; and (ii) the Chaucer acquisition. Revenues from Public Sector & Healthcare amounted to €36.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €11.2 million, or 43.9%, compared to €25.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Chaucer, Vidiemme and Medley, which contributed revenues of €11.5 million, €1.1 million, and €0.2 million, respectively. In the national Public Sector, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, revenues were relatively stable compared to the previous year. In particular, BIP consolidated its service provider role for several public companies and for central and local authorities, to support clients with digital transformation and the implementation of artificial intelligence. Revenues from Manufacturing amounted to €12.7 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease by €1.7 million, or 11.7%, compared to €14.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic as many manufacturing clients were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the temporary closure of their sites and the postponement of several projects. Revenues from Retail amounted to €14.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €5.0 million, or 52.5%, compared to €9.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by: (i) the acquisition of Vidiemme, which contributed revenues of €1.9 million in 2020; and (ii) an increase in services provided to several retail clients, in particular, projects related to digitalization of central processes for store operations, such as visual merchandising and space management. Revenues from Transportation amounted to €5.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, substantially unchanged compared to €5.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. Revenues from Other amounted to €5.3 million for financial year ended December 31, 2020. This result was primarily due to the acquisition of Chaucer and Vidiemme, which contributed revenues of approximately €3.9 million, as well as revenues derived from services we provided to a legal advisory business client. 92 ----- The following table sets forth an analysis of our revenues from sales and services by service area for the periods indicated.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The increase was primarily due to: (i) the organic growth of our business, in particular, our parent company, BIP strengthening its position with existing clients and an increase in demand for traditional and digital services; and (ii) the acquisition of Vidiemme, which contributed to an increase in our revenues of €5.1 million. 93 ----- _Other European countries_ Revenues from other European countries amounted to €56.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €19.6 million, or 53.2%, compared to €36.7 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Chaucer, as well as the €4.0 million increase in BIP Iberia’s revenues which was due to the recruiting in 2020 of skilled staff from a consulting firm with a strong expertise in the energy market, partially offset by the onset and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. _South America_ Revenues from South America amounted to €11.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €0.5 million, or 4.1%, compared to €10.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. This increase, partially offset by the depreciation of the Brazilian currency by more than 40.0% in 2020, was driven by the synergies arising from the integration of our two Brazilian subsidiaries, FBM and BIP Consultoria, and the growth of FBM in the Financial Services industry. _North America_ Revenues from North America amounted to €4.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €3.7 million, compared to €1.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by Vitrium, a US subsidiary of Chaucer, which was acquired in 2020. _Rest of the world_ Revenues from rest of the world amounted to €0.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €0.3 million, or 27.2%, compared to €1.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019, which was driven by a decrease in revenue as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. _Other revenues_ Other revenues amounted to €2.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €0.3 million, or 17.2%, compared to €1.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019.

Consulting and technical assistance costs amounted to €32.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €5.2 million, or 19.2%, compared to €27.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by advisory fees and other costs related to the acquisition of Chaucer, for an amount of €4.3 million. As a percentage of revenues, consulting and technical assistance costs was substantially unchanged, amounting to 11.2% in 2019 and 11.3% in 2020. Travel expenses amounted to €1.7 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of €4.1 million, compared to €5.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019.

This decrease was primarily due to a one-off rebranding expense incurred in 2019 by BIP for €0.9 million; and the absence of events in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. _Personnel expenses_",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Chaucer in 2020, with the preliminary purchase price allocation of Chaucer generating amortization expenses related to client relationships and brand, in the amount of €1.0 million and €0.4 million, respectively. An increase in write-downs by €0.6 million also contributed to the increase in amortization and depreciation. This increase was primarily due to: (i) existing office rental contracts early, as well as not renewing certain office rental contracts, for which, in some cases, we had made on site office improvements to; and (ii) suspend an internal client relationship management solution as well as a project we developed for the sale of telemedicine services. _Operating profit_ Operating profit amounted to €28.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €0.4 million, or 1.5%, compared to €28.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of the factors described above. _Finance income and expenses_",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

This decrease was primarily due to a one-off cost in December 2019 in connection with the release in the income statement of the amortized cost (for €3.5 million) related to the existing bond, repaid through the facility agreement we signed with a pool of banks and also due to the better interest rate conditions related to the facility agreement. The positive effect due to the decrease of interest rates has been partially offset by finance expenses of €0.7 million related to a new loan obtained in 2020 (the “Amendment and Restatement Agreement”) to finance the acquisition of Chaucer. _Income tax_",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The discussion includes a presentation of such line items as a percentage of revenues from sales and services for the respective periods presented, to facilitate period-over-period comparisons. As described in “—Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,” on March 27, 2018 Apax Partners France Fund acquired control of BIP. The transaction was carried out through the incorporation of BEEP, which acquired the entire shareholding of BIP, and subsequently BEEP was merged with and into BIP. As of BEEP’s incorporation on March 13, 2018 and since BEEP took control of the BIP S.p.A. on March 27, 2018, the income statement presented below for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 only includes results from March 13, 2018, the date of BEEP’s incorporation, to December 31, 2018, and reflect the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of BIP for the period from March 27 to December 31, 2018. As such, the results of operations for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 are not directly comparable to those for the financial year ended December 31, 2019.

Income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to BIP’s decision to realign tax and book value of certain assets by paying a substitute tax. In particular, we decided that BIP would realign the tax value of goodwill for €134.7 million, the client relationship for €40.5 million, and the BIP brand for €23.4 million by paying a substitute tax of 3.0%, equal to €6.0 million, which is to be paid in three annual installments beginning on June 30, 2021. The exercise of the option also involved the release of deferred tax liabilities in the amount of €17.8 million related to the BIP trademark and client relationship, since the statutory tax differences on these intangible assets no longer exist and a provision of deferred tax assets in the amount of €37.6 million related to the statutory tax differences on the value of goodwill.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Movements in trade working capital is not significantly affected by seasonality. We have undertaken management initiatives with the aim of optimizing trade working capital and, in particular, reducing the days sales outstanding (“DSO”). In addition, we realigned cash outflows and inflows and we improved our cash collection period. As at December 31, 2018 our cash collection period was 175 days, as at December 31, 2019 it was 173 days, as at December 31, 2020 it was 139 days and as at June 30, 2021 it was 134 days.

This increase was primarily due to the combined effect of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA of €9.8 million, from €25.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to €35.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 partially offset by an increase in non-recurring costs, amounting to €3.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to €1.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020.

The decrease in other current liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was mainly related to a decrease in deferred income, in payables to employees for the payment of variable compensation and in VAT payables. _Financial Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Financial Year Ended December 31, 2019_ Total cash flow from operating activities amounted to €81.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €28.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019, with an increase of €53.2 million. Operating cash flow before movements in working capital remained substantially stable, amounting to €47.7 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €47.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020. This change was primarily related to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of €9.7 million, from €42.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019 to €51.7 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, offset by higher non-recurring costs which amounted to €8.7 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €2.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flow from working capital increased from cash absorbed of €19.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019 to cash generated of €33.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to the following: (i) a decrease in trade receivables generated cash of €26 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, compared to cash absorbed of €16.7 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to initiatives we undertook in 2020 aimed at optimizing trade working capital, in particular greater use of factoring, that determined a significant decrease in DSO compared to the previous year; (ii) an increase in other current liabilities of €17.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an increase of €2.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019, and was primarily due to the increase in bonuses to employees of €14.0 million and in VAT payables; and (iii) a decrease in trade payables absorbed cash of €0.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, compared to cash generated of €3.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. _Financial Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Financial Year Ended December 31, 2018_ Total cash flow from operating activities amounted to €28.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019 compared to cash absorbed by operating activities amounting to €5.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018, with an increase of €33.3 million. 105 ----- Operating cash flow before movements in working capital increased by €24.2 million, from €23.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 to €47.7 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019.

Goodwill arising at the acquisition date is allocated to each of the cash-generating units, or groups of cashgenerating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies generated by the business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually and in any event whenever events indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The impairment test is carried out at the level of the smallest unit on the basis of which management directly or indirectly assesses the return on the investment that includes the goodwill itself. If the carrying amount of the cashgenerating unit is greater than the recoverable amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not subsequently reversed. The recoverable amount of a CGU (or group of CGUs) is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. An asset’s value in use is the present value of its estimated future cash flows calculated using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Future cash flows refer to those expected over a five-year time horizon, as well as those extrapolated from the final year of such time horizon for the purpose of estimating the terminal value. The long-term growth rate used to estimate the terminal value of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) is assumed to be no higher than the average long-term growth rate for the market sector in which the cash-generating unit (or group of units) operates. Future cash flows are estimated with reference to the current conditions of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) and, therefore, neither the benefits resulting from future restructuring to which the entity is not yet committed nor future investments to improve or optimize the unit are considered. For the purpose of impairment testing, the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit is determined in accordance with the method used to determine the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, excluding surplus assets (i.e. financial assets, deferred tax assets and net non-current assets held for sale) and including the portion of goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Provisions are based on best estimates at the reporting date of the present value of the expenditure required to extinguish the obligation or transfer it to third parties; provisions for onerous contracts are recognized at the lower of the cost of fulfilling the obligation, net of expected economic benefits arising from the contract, and the cost of terminating the contract. If the time value of money is material and the payment date of the obligations can be reasonably estimated, provisions are calculated, using the company’s average cost of debt, as the present value of the expected cash flows, taking into account the risks associated with the obligation.

In accordance with this method, the consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, determined as the sum of the fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Group at the acquisition date and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquired entity. Transaction costs are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. 110 ----- Contingent consideration, which is considered part of the transfer price, is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value. Goodwill is determined as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the equity attributable to non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. If the amount of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the equity attributable to non-controlling interests and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest, if any, in the acquiree, such excess is recognized immediately in other comprehensive income as income resulting from the completed transaction. The equity attributable to non-controlling interests at the acquisition date may be measured either at fair value or in proportion to the non-controlling interests’ interest in the acquiree’s identifiable assets. The choice of valuation method is made on a transaction by transaction basis. _Business combinations achieved in stages_ When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquired entity is measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. The previously held equity interest is then treated as if it were sold and reacquired at the date control is obtained. _Transactions involving non-controlling interests_ Changes in the ownership interest of a subsidiary that do not constitute a loss of control are treated as equity transactions. Accordingly, for acquisitions subsequent to gaining control, any positive or negative difference between the acquisition cost and the corresponding share of book equity is recognized directly in the Group’s equity; in the case of partial disposals of subsidiaries without loss of control, any gain is recognized directly in the Group’s equity. In the event that partial sales of subsidiaries result in the loss of control, the investment retained is adjusted to its fair value and the revaluation is included in the formation of the gain (loss) arising from the transaction. 111 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

In 2020, global consulting revenues decreased by 13%, which was driven by the COVID-19 pandemic as many companies aimed to conserve their cash position and as result paused consulting projects or cut back on their use of consulting services. The decrease in spending on consulting services was most heavily concentrated during the second quarter of 2020, following the first round of lockdowns and when businesses worldwide started to conserve cash. However, a sharp recovery is expected from 2021 onwards according to Source Global Research. _Global Consulting Market Trend (2011 Index 100), 1997-2024E_",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

This creates demand from organizations for continuous improvement and evolution at a faster pace. Megatrends encompass new technologies and changes in behavior and processes that are creating industry disruption and opportunities, including: - Fast-changing client needs and behaviors; - Growing importance of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors; - Disruptive, digitally native startups that are challenging market incumbents; - Increased focus on execution and implementation as well as results-oriented consulting versus strategic advisory; - Increased adoption of digital technology; and - Increased cybersecurity risks, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Clients need external consultants with specialist expertise to help them navigate complex, changing businesses as well as the technological environment. It is more effective to hire external consultants to focus on project work than to develop those capabilities in house. Leveraging the deep know-how and experience of external consultants significantly allows for companies to react more quickly. Oftentimes, the duration of consultancy work is longer than short-term contracts because competences evolve over time and companies require continued support. Megatrends are changing the type of consulting work clients are demanding. For example, there is an increase in demand for multi-capability projects and innovation capabilities from consultants, which command higher fees. Consulting companies are able to offer a growing range of consulting services and opportunities for value creation, especially due to multi-capability projects requiring end-to-end, tailored solutions, leading to complex, longer-term projects.

Businesses are now getting used to working in the new normal of “work from home/work from anywhere” as well as an increase in digital touchpoints—both with end customers as well as employees. The lockdowns forced businesses to rapidly reach their customers and adapt, as broad parts of the global economy went through a shock, forcing businesses to embrace digital methods (including 100% video conferencing, remote desktops and cloud solutions) almost overnight—something that they may not have otherwise envisioned.

The emergence and growth of ESG as a key element that is valued by communities and investors._ The increasing adoption of sustainable practices will require the adoption of new business/operative models, enabled by digital capabilities. Many companies are now reporting ESG metrics and understand that being recognized as a sustainable and responsible company has become an important factor in attracting new talent and retaining employees.

A focus on revenue growth initiatives is a #1 priority for CEOs in post COVID-19 recovery._ Customer needs and habits are undergoing permanent changes, pushing companies to reshape their market approach. As business cycles continue to shorten, strategic areas focused on revenue generation, such as innovation, strategy, experience design and marketing, are increasing in importance in order to keep pace with the shift in customer habits and market trends. Companies do not yet adequately cover these areas of business internally. Their revenue-enhancing services represent an opportunity for consulting firms to fill a gap in a fast-moving environment.

Our professional team includes 36 equity partners (the “Equity Partners”) and 111 partners, directors, associate partners, client partners and competence partners. Since we were established, we have expanded our geographic reach to 12 countries with 16 offices through our strong organic growth of approximately 16.7% per annum from 2004 to 2020 (in particular, we maintained organic growth during the financial crisis from 2008 to 2012 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020) and selective accretive acquisitions. We provide a wide range of advisory solutions and services to enterprise clients, including business advisory, strategy and innovation, technological advisory, digital advisory, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, digital twin, blockchain, data and analytics and digital delivery. Recognizing the importance of technological advances and digital transformation for clients and businesses, we were early to establish our innovation practice in 2009 and digital practice in 2013. The growing importance of technological advances and digital transformation to our clients combined with our in-depth industry specific knowledge and technological and digital competencies, have resulted in approximately 64% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 being related to digital transformation projects. We generated approximately 68.4% of our revenues in Italy for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Our other principal geographies include Brazil, the UK, Spain, Switzerland, the USA, and Colombia.

The market has been temporarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and is expected to rebound from 2021 and grow at a CAGR of 12.5% between 2020 and 2024. We have consistently out-performed the Reference Market, including during the COVID-19 pandemic reporting 7% organic growth in terms of revenues between 2019 and 2020. Our 125 ----- Reference Market benefits from strong ongoing digitalization trends across the public and private sectors and changes in operating models of companies and clients, further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, driving the need of specialized external consulting resources and increasing spending on transformation projects. Our wide range of end to end solutions, with distinctive digital capabilities, coupled with in-depth specific industry know-how and long-lasting relationships with our clients and partners, position us effectively to capitalize on the strong growth in demand for consulting services across our main industry verticals. Our clients include more than 600 private and blue chip companies, as well as public sector organizations, comprising Energy & Utilities companies (including Gruppo Enel, BP (British Petroleum), Gruppo Eni, Gruppo ACEA, Gruppo A2A, Enagas, Naturgy, Petrobras, Repsol and Snam), TMT companies (including Sky, Telecom Italia, Fastweb, and Teamsystem), Italian and European Financial Services institutions (including Allianz, UniCredit, Gruppo Generali, Gruppo BNP Paribas, ICCREA, AGOS, Nexi, Santander, UBS, and Visa), Public Sector organizations (including Poste Italiane, Banca d’Italia, the Istituto Nazionale Previdenza Sociale (INPS), the Italian Ministry of Justice (Ministero della Giustizia), and the Home Office (UK)), Healthcare companies (including Pfizer, GE healthcare, Novartis, Astrazeneca, Roche and Sanofi), Manufacturing companies (including Amplifon, Barilla, Leonardo and Daimler), Retail business (including Esselunga, Kering, and Luxottica), and Transportation companies (including ENAV). We aim to create long-term, strategic relationships with our clients, and to be an integral part of our clients’ business development and strategy implementation, focusing on value added projects that are normally related to recurring capital expenditures with lower renewal risk. Historically, we have been able to achieve long-lasting client relationships by providing a broad services offering covering our clients’ needs, including significantly customized and highly specialized services, as well as delivering consistent high-quality services. As of June 30, 2021, we had an average client relationship tenure of approximately 18 years for our top 10 clients and approximately nine years for our top 11 to top 20 clients. We have a low client concentration across all of our industry verticals, with no client accounting for more than 7.5% of our revenues and no industry vertical accounting for more than 27.7% of our revenues for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our top 10 clients generated approximately 33.3% of our revenues. Our ability to deliver value to our clients is a result of the character and expertise of our people. We rely on an entrepreneurial and committed leadership team of 36 Equity Partners, 111 partners, directors, associate partners, client partners and competence partners, and an experienced team of 257 senior managers and principals, who are supported by a talented pool of 3,237 other employees as of June 30, 2021. We combine core consulting skills and industry know-how with digital expertise in areas such as data and analytics, cybersecurity, customer relationship management (“CRM”) and digital delivery, cloud and artificial intelligence and automation, all fostered by a culture of innovation that extends to all reaches of our company. Historically, we have devoted significant resources to attract, train, develop, and retain our people. As a result, our workforce has grown from approximately 2,200 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 3,641 as of June 30, 2021, of which approximately 28% is based outside of Italy, driven by the increase of our digital practice as well as our internationalization, coupled with what we believe is best in class talent retention policies. We believe our business model has allowed us to quickly respond to our clients’ needs and continue to efficiently operate our business during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, during the periods of lockdown in Italy, Spain, Brazil and the UK, we were able to continue to ensure business continuity and service our clients, while safeguarding the health and safety of our employees. We successfully transitioned substantially all of our employees to remote working over a short period of time, maintaining high levels of service and assisting our clients with their responses to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of €286.2 million, compared to €242.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 representing an increase in revenues of 17.9%, of which approximately 7% was organic compared to an estimated approximately 13% decrease for the overall global consulting market.

Our Reference Market grew at a CAGR of approximately 6% between 2018 and 2019 and was only temporarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. While the 126 ----- overall global consulting market experienced a 13% decrease, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of €286.2 million, compared to €242.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 representing an increase in revenues of 17.9%, of which approximately 7% was organic. We have consistently out-performed the Reference Market, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Reference Market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of approximately 12.5% from 2020 until 2024 principally driven by (i) ongoing digitalization trends across the public and private sectors accompanied by an increase in spending on digital transformation projects, (ii) changes in operating models of companies and clients, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has focused businesses on the need for specialized external consulting resources, and (iii) shifting demand from traditional IT outsourcing and system integration to value-added technology advisory and delivery. We believe that our wide range of services, with distinctive digital capabilities, coupled with in-depth specific industry know-how underpinned by long-lasting client relationships, position us favorably to capitalize on the strong growth in demand for consulting services across our main markets. We have an extensive track record innovating, designing and implementing digital transformation projects that rethink our clients’ service delivery and sales functions, and these projects will continue to be central to the strategy of the major organizations of our Reference Industries. The consulting market in Italy, our primary geographic market, was estimated to be valued at approximately €4.6 billion in 2020 according to Assoconsult. The Italian consulting market grew at a CAGR of approximately 8.0% between 2015 and 2019, and experienced a temporary decrease of approximately 4.2% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Assoconsult. Despite this decrease, our revenues in Italy were €212.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €20.0 million, or 10.4%, compared to €192.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2019 due to the organic growth of our business, an increase in demand for traditional and digital services, and the minor acquisition of Vidiemme. In 2021, the Italian consulting market is estimated to increase by approximately 8.5%, driven by demand for: (i) digital projects including artificial intelligence, CRM, cloud services, internet of things (“IoT”), cybersecurity, digital twin and blockchain; and (ii) green projects such as developing and implementing sustainability strategies and plans to achieve greater corporate social responsibility. In addition, growth of the Italian consulting market is expected to further benefit from the structural under penetration of consulting spend in Italy, according to Assoconsult. Additionally, the Italian government and regulators are implementing policies that favor digitalization through IT investments, such as the Industry 4.0 plan and the National Plan for Innovation 2025. In addition, in July 2021, the Italian Government adopted the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza) (the “RRP”) which is expected to allocate resources totaling €235.0 billion between 2021 and 2026 for a reform agenda and investment program encompassing six policy areas or “missions” in Italy, of which approximately €50.0 billion is expected to be invested in the “digitalization, innovation, competitiveness, and culture” mission in Italy, and approximately €70.0 billion is expected to be invested in the “green revolution and ecologic transition” mission in Italy. We are at the intersection of these megatrends with an innovative and digital-focused practice, deep industry experience, and proven capabilities in the energy transition. We aim to capture part of the budget allocated to these initiatives to be spent by corporate and public sector organizations, which we believe will provide us with further opportunity to grow and boost our track record in next-generation advisory.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

630_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.33,Our Industries,18.33.1,,"We operate each of our service areas across six distinct industries: (i) Energy & Utilities, (ii) Telecommunication, Media & Entertainment (“TMT”), (iii) Financial Services, (iv) Public Sector & Healthcare (v) Manufacturing (vi) Retail, and (vii) Transportation. The diverse set of industries coupled with our wide range of service areas, provides us with cross-selling opportunities. Our six service areas are described below. _Energy & Utilities_ The Energy & Utilities industry quite literally power the societies in which we are a part. This industry faces a number of structural trends that require companies to respond, including the energy transition reshaping the energy value chain, a sharper awareness of environmental issues, new digitalization and cloudification, electrical mobility and infrastructure development necessitating more power for smart and connected devices, new business models and optimization of business models to put clients at the heart of service delivery. Our projects for clients in this industry include traditional areas of intervention (M&A, post-merger integration, organizational transformation, performance improvement, operational excellence, optimization models management and operation, trading and risk management, client strategy) as well as the transformation driven by new approaches, technologies and our digital future (data science, artificial intelligence, digital twin, blockchain, agile transformation, human-machine interface). Our offering for Energy & Utilities clients includes, among other services, deal strategy, digital strategy and innovation, chief executive officer services, client strategy and performance improvement, chief financial officer services, and energy management.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated approximately 27.7% of our revenues from clients in the Energy & Utilities industry. _Telecommunication, Media & Entertainment_ The Technology, Media and Entertainment (“TMT”) industry is where one of the most intense battles of the global economy is being fought. A number of trends are converging and are reshaping the TMT, including telecommunications as a strategic asset, 5G networks and the development of integrated ecosystems, the emergence of cloud, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity platforms, new patterns of remote working, the transition to digital telecommunications, and the proliferation of new entertainment models. Our offering in the TMT space includes a strong digital orientation through transformative technology projects, marketing and sales redesign, human capital optimization and client operation consulting and enterprise control advisory. In the TMT industry, we are strongly positioned in Brazil and Italy and we work with clients such as Sky. We are able to leverage our competencies in x-tech and cybersecurity coupled with our know-how of smart integration of 5G to support our clients’ transformation of their networks and operating processes. We believe that we are well positioned for the infrastructural component of our clients’ business such as towers and data centers and edge technologies, such as IoT and edge computing. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated approximately 20.7% of our revenues from clients in the TMT industry. _Financial Services_ Within the Financial Services industry, we work with banking and payment providers as well as insurers. Since 2013, financial services have been undergoing an important phase of renewal and technological development, based on three directives of change: open innovation, data economy, and full 24/7 omni-channelling. For our clients in the Financial Services industry, we create business value by acting on two levels: (i) increase in revenues and reduction of operating costs (profit and loss (“P&L”) value initiatives) and (ii) strategic positioning within the market (enterprise value/share value). In the P&L field, we indicate both how to exploit digital innovation to increase revenue (digital business), and how to reduce operating costs and make IT infrastructure more efficient (digital operations and IT). We support strategic operations (strategic transformation), creating new business opportunities (open innovation) and implementing more effective working methods (cultural change and digital acumen). In the Financial Services industry we are strongly positioned in Italy and have sizeable coverage in Brazil and the UK, and we plan to further expand in Spain. We believe that we are wellpositioned to support financial institutions, in particular, with their digitalization processes and to assist them with cybersecurity, development of CRM systems and adoption of emerging technologies, such as IoT, digital twin and blockchain. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated approximately 20.6% of our revenues from clients in the Financial Services industry. 137 ----- _Public Sector & Healthcare_ The Public Sector & Healthcare industries are changing as society transforms with digitalization. The key industry trends affecting the Public Sector include digitization, new mobility patterns and the mobilization of funds related to the EU Green Deal and the COVID-19 pandemic recovery plan. Our offering for Public Sector clients is based on the themes of strategies and policymaking, organization and operations, public human capital, compliance, structural funds and EU programs, public finance, digital transformation, and ICT. In the Public Sector, we are currently underrepresented on a global level, but we have sizeable coverage in Italy and the UK. We believe that we are well-positioned to leverage our ability to manage public auctions combined with the envisaged need for external support required by the Public Sector, and believe that given our know-how and expertise we will be fundamental in supporting clients with emerging trends such as space 4.0. Healthcare has been radically reshaped with the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is also being affected by other industry trends, including a need for a client centric approach, the creation of healthcare ecosystems, a shift to digital, business model evolution, and virtual health delivery. Our offering in the Healthcare sector comprises engagements based on healthcare client experience, access and disease landscape, digital health scouting, strategic transformation, future organization, portfolio evolution, health analytics and disease management optimization, and digital health deployment.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated approximately 16.6% of our revenues from clients in the Public Sector & Healthcare industry. _Manufacturing_ In the Manufacturing industry, factories are turning towards different processing systems based on new technologies. World manufacturing is emerging from a long phase of development, which occurred as a result of globalization. The pressure to change is intense as there is an increasingly closer link between the external environment and the company, distributed IT and advanced robotics, there is business assistance, with processes that may be equated with scheduled maintenance for products or services that are offered and sold, and knowledge products, or products with an intensity of knowledge which can be self-configured through physical hardware, accompanied by cognitive software which is essential for use. All of these have certain consequences including for example, the reduction in the number of controllable levers, review of mandatory processes, and the need to find value attributes for the client, among others. We help our clients remain equipped with new competencies to cope with the changes within the Manufacturing industry. Our offering in the Manufacturing industry includes: - Strategy and Operational Excellence: assisting our clients in translating business strategy into operational strategy to support business plans. - Procurement: supporting our customers in this task, we use the supplier value management approach which is capable of obtaining the best quality, price, and service; - Maintenance: helping our customers develop a maintenance strategy that maximizes reliability and availability to improve performance and cost containment; - Supply Chain Management: supporting our customers in today’s challenges, which call for a review of processes to ensure governance of an increasingly complex networked system; and - Continuous Improvement: focusing on people’s conduct and developing tools and processes that root them in the organization, to form a new culture of change and continuous improvement. We believe that our advanced technological capabilities position us to help our clients reinvent the operating, production, and value chain models of the Manufacturing industry. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated approximately 4.3% of our revenues from clients in the Manufacturing industry. _Retail_ Retail has been impacted by the convergence of digital and physical marketplaces, which has had implications across the whole value chain from logistics to distribution and payments. This has directly impacted the decisions retail companies make as well as who makes those decisions. For example, chief digital officers have a wide remit to use small and big data across the whole organization, chief innovation officers are tasked with inventing a new business while keeping the old one running, chief growth officers are expected to design internal operating 138 ----- systems to accelerate speed to market and better compete with start-ups, and chief sustainability officers must find a way to ensure that a focus on quarterly revenues does not compromise everyone’s future. To support this transformation, we deploy cross-disciplinary teams with expertise in data, design, marketing, and technology. This enables us to create more effective omni-channel strategies, develop shopper-friendly artificial intelligence and virtual assistants, improve E-Commerce performance and optimize geo-marketing activities based on rigorous sales forecasting. Our offering in the retail space is vast and includes, for example, developing: (i) employer branding; (ii) brand strategy and design; (iii) go-to-market strategies; (iv) bespoke customer programs that combine technology; (v) marketing and communication to help our clients manage their customers efficiently and effectively; (vi) predictive models to forecast sales and optimize demand and material planning; (vii) KPI-driven programs to drive the effectiveness of distribution channels; and (viii) roles, systems and processes to drive digital transformation and optimize processes through, for example, AI applications and advanced algorithms. We believe that, given the diverse skill sets of our employees, we are well positioned to help our clients in an industry that has been challenged by disruptive forces to reinvent itself to thrive in the digital age. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated approximately 5.7% of our revenues from clients in the Retail industry. _Transportation_ Unprecedented challenges in the Transportation industry require major changes. Those in the Transportation industry must not only keep up with the technological changes to remain competitive, but must also ensure that they are in compliance with the changing regulations, as well as the push towards increased sustainability. We provide our clients with the tools to embrace digital innovation. For example, our offering in the Transportation sector includes: - Digitalize airport management to reduce costs and improve quality of service; - Reorganize airport handling operations, with the use of Mobile technologies; - Improve air traffic control through technology innovation (for example, digital towers); - Develop smart roads and intelligent transport systems models; - Increase automation of road management (for example, platooning and autonomous vehicles); - Improve transportation routes through big data information; and - Support clients with the use of public transport innovations and synergies (for example, ride-sharing, car-sharing, and bike and scooter sharing). We believe that our technological capabilities combined with our industry know-how, allows us to help our clients remain competitive.

Our engagements are led by one or more partners and are almost always interdisciplinary in nature, involving analysts, engineers, technologists, creatives, marketers, and project and change managers.

We may also hire subcontractors for discreet assignments that may be ancillary or expedient to serving the client’s needs. - _Project Plan: The project plan phase involves determining the path for successful execution, including, brainstorming for project organization and distribution of tasks, establishment of sub-teams and reporting lines, joint work with the client to determine focal points for collection of data and case studies, and project storyboarding, which creates a blueprint for the project deliverable(s) and work product(s), including structure and takeaways. - _Business and Technological Advisory: This phase involves the execution of the project, including working closely with client teams to map the problem, identify and troubleshoot solutions and deploy products, processes and other applications. The advisory phase consists of client interviews and data collection through project execution. Throughout the process, our consultants attempt to fully embed themselves with the client in order to understand constraints and opportunities and triangulate the best approach to delivering tailored advice. Data is rendered relevant, analyzed and made easy to understand in order for recommendations and takeaways to be imparted. - _Handover, Client Presentation and Approval: During the handover phase, the work product(s) and deliverable(s) are presented and our consultants develop and operationalize a master plan for change management to enable the client organization to execute and adopt the engagement’s recommendations and next steps. Documents are delivered and approved by the client, and other client teams that will be involved in following the project’s recommendations are trained and onboarded.

In addition, we are subject to a further level of regulation primarily arising under the applicable regulatory provisions in the field of cybersecurity, including (as applicable) Directive (EU) 2016/1148 on cybersecurity (the “NIS Directive”), as implemented at a national level pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 65 of May 18, 2018. Since we provide, among others, cyber intelligence solutions, as well as certain technical services, we may be subject to additional Italian cybersecurity regulations, pursuant to Law Decree No. 161 of December 30, 2019. Furthermore, our participation in public tenders subjects us to further regulation under the Italian Code of Public Contracts (the “ICPP”), currently set forth in Legislative Decree No. 50 of April 18, 2016 and related implementing measures. The ICPP replaced the previous code of public contracts set forth by Legislative Decree No. 163 of April 12, 2006, which, however, continues to regulate all the tender procedures based on calls for bids published before April 19, 2016. The provisions of the ICPP are mainly aimed at ensuring that public contracting authorities/entities apply the best criteria to select contractors in terms of costs and quality of the relevant offers in compliance with the EU principles of efficiency, free competition, non-discrimination, transparency and proportionality. According to the ICPP, participation in public tenders requires us to meet three main sets of requirements, namely (i) general morality requirements, (ii) economic and financial capacity, and (iii) technical and professional skills. Requirements (ii) and (iii) are identified by the awarding entities on a case-by-case basis since they relate and proportionate to the subject matter of the public tender; requirement (i) has a general scope and aims at excluding from the tenders, among others: (a) subjects or entities that have been convicted of certain types of crimes with a non-appealable judgment (including, participation in criminal organizations, corruption, bribery, fraud, terrorism and mafia-related crimes); (b) entities facing bankruptcy or involved in proceedings for the declaration of bankruptcy; (c) entities which failed to pay social security contributions or taxes; (d) subjects or entities found guilty of material professional misconduct which renders their integrity or reliability questionable; (e) entities which rendered misrepresentations; and (f) entities subject to the sanctions disqualifying them from exercising certain activities as provided by LD 231/2001.

In particular, our operations are subject to anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations, including the Italian Royal Decree 1398/1930 and the Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001 (“LD 231/2001”), US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (“FCPA”), the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 (the “Bribery Act”), and other similar laws in the countries where we do business (collectively, “Anti-Corruption Laws”). We have taken and will continue to take action to ensure the constant and complete implementation of the best practices for compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. We have adopted a “Code of Ethics” that includes provisions addressing compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations and best practices. We have also adopted the specific model provided for by LD 231/2001 (Modello di Organizzazione e Gestione, the “231 Model”) aimed at preventing the possibility to commit specifically identified offences in the interest of or for the benefit of our company. In addition, we have also appointed the supervisory body provided for by LD 231/2001 (Organismo di Vigilanza), with the scope to supervise the functioning, the correct application and the adherence to the 231 Model, the internal procedures and the commitment to constantly update those procedures.

If a Senior Notes Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding or the relevant Senior Secured Debt Payment Default has ceased to be continuing (by being waived by the Relevant Representative or remedied) the relevant Debtor may then make those payments it would have otherwise been entitled to pay under any Senior Notes and if it does so promptly any event of default under any Senior Notes caused by such delayed payment shall be waived and any enforcement notice which may have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be waived. A Senior Secured Debt Payment Default is remedied by the payment of all amounts then due. 160 ----- _Restrictions on Enforcement by any Senior Notes; Senior Notes Standstill_ Without prejudice to the rights of the Senior Creditors to take Enforcement Action in relation to any Senior Notes Issuer Liabilities and/or any Senior Notes Only Security, prior to the discharge of all the Senior Secured Liabilities, neither any Senior Notes Trustee nor the holders of any Senior Notes may take Enforcement Action with respect to any Senior Notes (including any action against any Senior Notes Issuer or the guarantors of any Senior Notes (if any)) or direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the enforcement of any relevant Transaction Security document (including the Shared Security) without the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group (as defined below), except that such restriction will not apply in relation to any Senior Notes Guarantee Liabilities and Shared Security if (1) an event of default has occurred under any Senior Notes resulting from failure to pay principal at final maturity or (2): (a) an event of default under any Senior Notes Indenture is continuing; (b) the RCF Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Liabilities have received notice of the specified event of default from any Senior Notes Trustee; (c) a Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and (d) the relevant event of default is continuing at the end of the Standstill Period. A “Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that any Senior Notes Trustee serves an enforcement notice on the RCF Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Liabilities until the earliest of: (a) 179 days after such date; (b) the date on which the Security Agent takes Enforcement Action (including the enforcement of any Transaction Security permitted to be enforced under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), provided that any Senior Notes Trustee and holders of Senior Notes may only take the same Enforcement Action against the same entity as is taken by the Senior Secured Creditors and may not take any other action against any other member of the Group; (c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of any guarantor of any Senior Notes against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; and (d) the expiration of any other Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that the current Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or permitted remedy thereof). If an Event of Default ceases to be continuing then (provided the relevant parties are made aware of such fact) any relevant enforcement process (including any requirement of consultation relating to enforcement) relying solely on that Event of Default shall cease to continue. Substantially similar provisions to those described in this section with respect to any Senior Notes are included in the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to Future Senior Debt and related Future Senior Creditors. If the Security Agent has notified any Senior Notes Trustee that it is enforcing Transaction Security, no other Senior Notes Creditor may take any enforcement action against the Third Party Security Provider, that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Transaction Security where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom. If any Senior Notes Creditors are permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to require the enforcement of such Transaction Security, such Enforcement Action must require the realization of the relevant Security by way of a sale or disposal conducted in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. _Consultation_ Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction Security and/or the requesting of a distressed disposal and/or the release or disposal of claims and/or Transaction Security on a distressed disposal (“Enforcement”), the relevant representative of the Super Senior Liabilities or the Senior Secured Liabilities (as applicable) shall notify the Security Agent and the creditor representatives for each of the Super Senior Creditors and each of the Senior Secured Creditors that the applicable Transaction Security has become enforceable. As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent to solicit instructions with respect to the enforcement of the Transaction Security or the taking of any other Enforcement Action by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following which, the RCF Agent (acting on the instructions of the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors), the Cash Management Facility Agent, the representative of any Future Pari Passu Creditors and the Trustee will 161 ----- consult in good faith with each other and the Security Agent for a period of 15 days from the date such notice is received by such persons (or such shorter period as the relevant parties may agree) with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy (the “Consultation",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

If prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Senior Creditors are entitled to give, and have given, instructions, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or Holding Company that is a member of the Group from any Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Super Senior Creditor unless those Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent Liability relating to a Letter of Credit, Cash Management Facility LC, a Cash Management Facility or an Ancillary Facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor), following that release. _Application of Proceeds of a Distressed Disposal_ The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Application of Proceeds/ _Waterfall” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the_ extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if the disposal of liabilities had not occurred. 168 ----- _Voting and Amendments_ Voting in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes and/or Future Pari Passu Debt will be in accordance with the relevant documents.

Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement (other than a member of the Group) shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters. _General_ The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions dealing with: (a) close-out rights for the Priority Hedge Counterparties and the Non-Priority Hedge Counterparties; (b) permitted payments (including without limitation, the repayment of Shareholder Liabilities and the payment of permitted distributions in each case to the extent permitted under the terms of the relevant documents relating to the Senior Secured Debt, any Senior Notes and the Future Senior Debt); (c) incurrence of Future Pari Passu Debt or Future Senior Debt that will allow certain creditors and agents with respect to such Future Pari Passu Debt or Future Senior Debt, as the case may be, to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement and benefit from, and be subject to, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement so long as not prohibited under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the Indenture and Future Senior Debt shall be subject to the same subordination provisions as any Senior Notes; (d) the ability to replace or supplement the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with facilities benefiting from a similar position under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; (e) payments received by creditors which are not permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to be held on trust for the Security Agent and provided to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; and (f) customary protections for any Senior Notes Trustee and the Trustee. _Governing law_ The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with English law. 171 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

If following the Consultation Period, the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be instructed to implement the same. Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions (and for these purposes the failure to give instructions is deemed to be a conflicting instruction) are received by the end of the Consultation Period, the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security and/or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security and/ or take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in each case provided such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all instructions received by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be deemed revoked. If the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (acting reasonably) consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the security in a manner which is not consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles, subject to (a) and (b) above, the relevant representative shall give notice to the other representatives after which each such representative shall consult with the Security Agent for a period of 10 days (or such lesser period as the relevant representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of Enforcement, provided that such representatives shall not be obliged to consult more than once in relation to each Enforcement Action. For the purposes of Enforcement, an “Instructing Group” means if prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if: (a) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been repaid in full within six months of the end of the Consultation Period (or within six months of the delivery of a specified notice by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, where no consultation period is required); (b) the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period (or within three months of the delivery of a specified notice by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, where no consultation period is required); or (c) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Relevant Company and the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with respect to such Relevant Company, then the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions) to the exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent conflicting with any instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors) and the Instructing Group in 162 ----- relation to such Enforcement shall mean the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors. Subject to the foregoing, in the event of Conflicting Enforcement Instructions, the “Instructing Group” shall mean the Majority Senior Secured Creditors provided that such instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors are Qualifying Instructions, it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the timeframe for the realization of value from the enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal pursuant to such instructions will be determined by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors. Prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date: (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Shared Security; or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group in relation to the Shared Security, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Shared Security which the Majority Senior Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) are then entitled to give to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, as described under the heading “—Restrictions on Enforcement by any Senior Notes; Senior Notes Standstill” below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time any Senior Creditor or its Creditor Representative is then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Shared Security and the Majority Senior Creditors do not give such instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Shared Security as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given by the Senior Creditors or its Creditor Representative under this Agreement and Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group. For the avoidance of doubt, the above provisions do not apply to the enforcement of any Senior Notes Only Security where the Security Agent will act in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Creditors (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). _Security Enforcement Principles_ Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Cash Management Facility Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Senior Secured Notes Required Holders (as defined below) (if prior to the Senior Secured Notes Discharge Date), the Future Pari Passu Debt Required Holders (as defined below) and the Issuer, enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in accordance with the “Security Enforcement Principles,” which are summarized as follows: (a) It shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from Enforcement of the Transaction Security, the recovery by the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Notes Creditors and the Future Pari Passu Creditors (the “Security Enforcement Objective”). (b) The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that either (i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash (or substantially all cash) for distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or (ii) if Enforcement is at the direction of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Senior Creditors, sufficient proceeds from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise). (c) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value from the Enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal (as defined below) pursuant to Enforcement will be determined by the Instructing Group provided that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective. (d) On (i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €5,000,000 (or its equivalent); or (ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists, the Security Agent shall (unless such enforcement is made pursuant to a public auction or process supervised by a court of law which makes a determination as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally recognized investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable, third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those charged under the Transaction Security to be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert (A) on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Principles and maximize recovery of any such Enforcement Action, (B) that the proceeds received from enforcement is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective. 163 ----- (e) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement. The liability of any Financial Advisor in respect of the opinions referred to in paragraph (d) above may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement. (f) The Financial Advisor’s opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to any other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met. (g) In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares referred to in (d)(i) above and such Enforcement is conducted by way of public auction, any equity investors of the Group shall be entitled to participate in such auction. There is no requirement in the Security Enforcement Principles that requires the Enforcement of Transaction Security to take place by way of public auction. (h) In the absence of written notice from a creditor or group of creditors that are not part of the relevant Instructing Group that such creditor(s) object to any Enforcement of the Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an “Objection”), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such Enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective. (i) If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent to rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgement in accordance with this Agreement), a Financial Advisor’s opinion to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive evidence that the requirement of paragraph (a) above has been met. For the avoidance of doubt, the above provisions do not apply to the enforcement of any Senior Notes Only Security. _Turnover_ The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if any Super Senior Creditor, Cash Management Facility Creditor, Senior Secured Notes Creditor, Senior Creditor and Future Pari Passu Creditor receives or recovers the proceeds of any Enforcement of Transaction Security (whether before or after an insolvency event) or any Senior Notes Only Security other than in accordance with Payments Waterfall that it shall (subject to certain prior actual knowledge qualifications in the case of the Trustee and any Senior Notes Trustee, as applicable): - in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities of that creditor (or, if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount or an amount equal to that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and - in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. Certain further turnover obligations following receipt of non-permitted payments apply to Senior Notes Creditors, Future Senior Creditors and Subordinated Creditors. _Application of Proceeds/Waterfall_ All amounts received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the realization or Enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security (and, in relation to the Senior Creditors, Shared Security) or otherwise paid to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement for application in accordance with the Payments Waterfall (the “Enforcement Proceeds”), other than with respect to any Senior Notes Only Security, will be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the following payments waterfall in each case to the extent that security has been given in favor of such obligations (the “Payments Waterfall”): - _first, in payment of the following amounts in the following order (i) pari passu and pro rata any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any of its delegates and any Trustee Liabilities as the case may be, and then (ii) pari passu and pro rata to each Creditor Representative (as the term is defined in the 164 ----- Intercreditor Agreement) (to the extent not included in (i) above and excluding any Hedge Counterparty as its own Creditor Representative) of the costs and expenses of each such Creditor Representative and any receiver, attorney or agent appointed by such Creditor Representative under any Transaction Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreement;

All amounts received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the realization or Enforcement of all or any part of any Senior Notes Only Security will be applied in accordance with a separate payments waterfall as follows: - _first, in payment of the following amounts in the following order (i) pari passu and pro rata any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any of its delegates and any Trustee Liabilities, as the case may be, and then (ii) pari passu and pro rata to each Creditor Representative of the holders of any Senior Notes 165 ----- and the Future Senior Creditors of the costs and expenses of each such Creditor Representative and any receiver, attorney or agent appointed by such Creditor Representative under any Senior Notes Only Security document or the Intercreditor Agreement; - _second, pari passu and pro rata, to any Senior Notes Trustee and to the relevant Creditor Representative on behalf of the Future Senior Creditors in or towards payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the by the holders of any Senior Notes and any of Future Senior Creditors in connection with any realization or enforcement of any Senior Notes Only Security taken in accordance with the terms of any Senior Notes Only Security documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent; - _third, pari passu and pro rata, to any Senior Notes Trustee on behalf of the holders of any Senior Notes for application towards the discharge of any Senior Notes Liabilities (in accordance with the relevant documents) and to the relevant Creditor Representative on behalf of the Future Senior Creditors for application towards the discharge of the Future Senior Debt (in accordance with the relevant documents); and - _fourth, after the Senior Debt Discharge Date, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider or other person entitled to it. _Acceleration_ If an event of default occurs under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes or Future Pari Passu Debt then any decision to accelerate the Revolving Credit Facility or Notes or Future Pari Passu Debt and, subject as provided below, to take any other Enforcement Action will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture (or other relevant Senior Secured Notes Indenture) or in accordance with the terms of the Future Pari Passu Debt (as applicable).

We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). Except with respect to right of payment and optional redemption, and as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Notes issued in this Offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, such Subsidiary will pay the holders of its debt and its trade creditors before it will be able to distribute any of its assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor, if any. The primary operations of the Issuer are being conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than future Guarantors, if any). The Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any relevant approval and/or authorization by any competent authority, to merge the Issuer with and into the Targets as soon as reasonably practicable following the Issue Date in accordance with applicable provisions of Italian law, with BIP expected to be the surviving entity.

As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, BIP represented approximately 71.0%, 68.5% and 69.9% of the consolidated revenues (excluding intercompany transactions), consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (excluding intercompany transactions) and consolidated total assets (excluding intercompany receivables and equity investments in subsidiaries) of BIP and its consolidated subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer would have had €275.0 million principal amount of indebtedness, all represented by the Notes and the Issuer’s Subsidiaries (including the Target Group) would have had €38.5 million of indebtedness, of which €24.9 million would have consisted of lease liabilities and €13.6 million would have consisted of certain other indebtedness. This does not include obligations under acquisition-related earn-out and deferred consideration arrangements, a participative financial instrument issued to employees by BIP and a loan granted by a minority shareholder to our Subsidiary Advantis. Additionally, we would have had €50.0 million in undrawn borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization.” Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.

If Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London or Frankfurt office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, EURIBOR for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.

If at least two such rates are so provided, EURIBOR for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then EURIBOR for the Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. If the Issuer determines, prior to any Determination Date, that: (1) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR; (2) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently; (3) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR; (4) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or (5) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent of the Issuer to calculate any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR, a Rate Determination Agent, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, shall select a successor rate to EURIBOR that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been recommended or selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or body or that is expected to develop as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Notes, as more fully set forth in the Indenture (and any applicable adjustment spread required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR (the “Adjustment Spread”)) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”), and the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least three Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such Successor Rate (and the Adjustment Spread) (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s certificate conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Holders shall be bound by any such Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread) without any further action or consent by the Holders or the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, the sum of the Successor Rate and the Adjustment Spread shall, in all cases, not be less than 0%. The Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread).

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under any applicable law.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The Merger is subject to certain conditions and may not be completed. Relevant mechanics to facilitate the Merger, including any requirements for Mergerco to assume the rights and obligations of the Issuer under the Notes Documents prior to the Merger, will be included in the Indenture. Following completion of the Merger, all references in the Indenture to the “Issuer” shall refer to Mergerco, unless the context otherwise requires. Failure to complete the Merger shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Collateral and any Future Notes _Guarantees—We may be unable to complete the Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_ The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed to agree, for the purposes of Section 2503-bis (et seq.) of the Italian Civil Code, to the consummation of the Merger and, in the event that BIP or another Target is the Successor Company (or otherwise the successor company to the Issuer) after giving effect to the Merger, the assumption by Mergerco of all obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any relevant Security Documents, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, upon completion of the Merger.

Although there will be no initial Guarantors, in the event that the Merger does not occur within 12 months from the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that BIP, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to the limitations mentioned above, guarantee the Notes within 120 days of the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing Date. Additionally, if required by the covenant as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes _Guarantees” and subject to the Agreed Security Principles and other limitations described in the covenant, each_ Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees Indebtedness of the Issuer or any future Guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility, any other Credit Facility or any Public Debt shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement within 20 Business Days of providing such guarantee. To the extent provided in future, any Notes Guarantee will be a joint and several obligation of each Guarantor. Each Notes Guarantee, if any, will: - be a general senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Notes Guarantee; - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Notes Guarantee; and - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the applicable Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation. Any Notes Guarantees that are subject to limitations under applicable law will be contractually limited under the applicable Notes Guarantee to reflect such limitations with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners or other considerations under applicable law. In 177 ----- addition, each Notes Guarantee (if any) will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the relevant Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Collateral _and any Future Notes Guarantees—The Issuer is incorporated in Italy, and Italian insolvency laws may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as insolvency laws in other jurisdictions with which they may be familiar,”_ “—The Notes Collateral and any future guarantees of the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on _enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar principles. The Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor, if any, will automatically terminate and release: (1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture; (2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; (3) upon defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and _Discharge”;_ (4) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) does not guarantee any other Credit Facility or Public Debt; (5) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”; (7) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants— _Additional Notes Guarantees”;_ (8) as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited by the covenant described below under “—Certain _Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”; or_ (9) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A BookEntry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction. Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture.

Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Definitive Registered Notes: (1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes; (2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part; (3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or (4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer. 179 ----- The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The Pre-Merger Collateral and, following the Merger (if it occurs), the Post-Merger Collateral, together with any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Indenture, in each case as may be in existence from time to time, is referred to herein as the “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain _Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees,” certain property, rights and assets (other than the Collateral described_ in the first and second paragraphs of this section) may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. The following is a summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles: - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance (including under Article 2358 and/or 2374 of the Italian Civil Code), anti-trust and other completion authority restrictions, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, transfer pricing, “interest stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “liquidity impairment” rules, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a Notes Guarantee or security or may require that Notes Guarantees or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. If any such limit applies, the Notes Guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount which the relevant member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence) and subject to fiduciary duties of management; - a key factor in determining whether or not a Notes Guarantee or security shall be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost (including material adverse tax consequences or adverse effects on interest deductibility and stamp duty, registration taxes, notarization and registration fees) which shall not be disproportionate to the benefit to the secured parties of obtaining such Notes Guarantee or security; 180 ----- - the giving of a Notes Guarantee, the granting and the terms of security or the perfection of the security granted will not be required to the extent that Group would incur any legal fees, registration fees, notarial fees, stamp duty, taxes and any other fees or costs directly associated with such security or Notes Guarantee which are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the secured parties and/or having regard to the extent of the obligations which can be guaranteed or secured by that security and the priority that will be offered by taking or perfecting the security. In particular, it is acknowledged that the Issuer and/or Guarantor will not opt (where possible) for the Imposta Sostitutiva regime pursuant to article 15 and subsequent of Italian Presidential Decree No. 601/1973 as amended and supplemented from time to time. Accordingly, Italian law governed security that requires payment of an ad valorem registration tax on the amount of the secured obligations will not be taken unless it can be executed by way of exchange of correspondence. The secured obligations under any Italian law pledge over quotas of a limited liability company (società a responsabilità _limitata) shall be limited to amounts directly borrowed under the Security Documents by the relevant_ quotaholder and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be granted if no amounts have been directly borrowed by such quotaholder. Non-Italian security that requires payment of an ad valorem registration tax on the amount of the secured obligation will not be taken if tax duty cannot be minimized upon execution (including through a cap to the secured obligations agreed between the security agent and the Issuer (each acting reasonably)); - where there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets owned by the Issuer or any Guarantor in a particular category, the principle stated in the second previous bullet above shall apply and, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, only the material assets in that category shall be subject to security; - in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible, impractical or disproportionately costly to grant Notes Guarantees or create security over certain categories of assets, in which event such Notes Guarantees will not be granted and security will not be taken over such assets; - certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another external body’s or person’s consent may be required to enable a member of the Group to provide a Notes Guarantee or security. Such Notes Guarantee and/or security shall not be required unless such consent has been received; provided that reasonable endeavors have been used by the relevant member of the Group to obtain the relevant consent (provided that the relevant member of the Group may refrain from taking any action to obtain the relevant consent if it considers that such action might have an adverse impact on relationships with third parties); - any assets subject to legal requirements, licenses or any other third-party arrangements (including, without limitation, any trade receivables) which may prevent those assets from being charged (or assets which, if charged, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations of the Group in respect of those assets or require any member of the Group to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof) will be excluded from any relevant Security Document provided that, if the relevant asset is material and the relevant member of the Group determines (acting in good faith) that such endeavors will not jeopardize commercial relationships with third parties, the relevant member of the Group will use commercially reasonable endeavors (for a specified period of time) to obtain any necessary consent or waiver; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no security shall be required over (and no consent or waiver request submitted with respect to) assets which are required to support indebtedness assumed in connection with an acquisition to the extent permitted by the terms of the Notes Documents to remain outstanding following a permitted acquisition (“Acquired",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any person who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly. The Payor or any agent thereof so required will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 45 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 30 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely, without further inquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption of Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay (and will indemnify the Holder for) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery or registration of any Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Security Documents, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than, in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this Offering) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto or any such taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee or any Security Documents (limited, solely in the case of any such taxes or similar charges or levies attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (8) or any combination thereof) excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any registration, stamp duty, documentary or other similar tax, charge or levy arising from the execution of any formality made directly by, or on behalf of the Holder and not necessary to maintain, preserve, establish, or enforce the rights of such Holder under the Notes, any Notes Guarantee, any Security Document, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto. 191 ----- The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply _mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized or otherwise resident for tax_ purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540
630_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.22,Change of Control,21.22.1,,"If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change of _Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such Holder’s_ Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101.000% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase any series of Notes as described under this heading, “Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived. Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional _Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is_ 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101.000% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) and the record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost and instructions of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. 192 ----- For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the _Notes, the Notes Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—Future liquidity and cash flow difficulties could prevent us from repaying the Notes when due or repurchasing the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes. 193 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

(2) all Indebtedness Incurred under any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit Facility) that is secured by Liens on the Collateral that are accorded super senior priority status with respect to proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be deemed to have been Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified;

and (b) in any case where such amounts are or may be based on Consolidated EBITDA (or any ratio of which Consolidated EBITDA is a component), shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the amount of Consolidated EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness and such Lien will be permitted to be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or replacement, such excess will continue); and (10) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clauses (10), (29) or (32) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” or any Permitted Collateral Lien, the Incurrence thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or use of clauses (1) through (16) of the preceding 197 ----- paragraph (if any) for borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant and under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens” irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture, and, to the extent the usage of clauses (1) through (16) of the second preceding paragraph (if any), shall (other than with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility) be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and, in each case, the Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer will not be permitted to designate such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary and any such designation will not be deemed operative under the Indenture). For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a first or junior Lien basis. 198 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security 217 ----- satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (or 150 days for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2019), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture. The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of actual knowledge or written notice, that the Issuer is duly complying with its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions, steps or proceedings in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action, steps or proceedings directly.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor their respective agents take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the relevant Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants. 261 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

See “—Tax Treatment of Capital Gains” and “—Long-term Savings Accounts”); 262 ----- (b) a partnership (other than a società in nome collettivo or società in accomandita semplice or similar partnership) or a de facto partnership not carrying out commercial activities (società semplice) or professional association; (c) a non-commercial private or public institution, trusts not carrying out mainly or exclusively commercial activities, the Italian State and public and territorial entities; or (d) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation, then Interest derived from the Notes, and accrued during the relevant holding period, is subject to a withholding tax, referred to as “imposta sostitutiva,” levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or obtained upon disposal of the Notes) unless the relevant Italian Resident Noteholder holds the Notes in a discretionary investment portfolio managed by an authorized intermediary and, under certain conditions, has validly opted for the application of the “Risparmio gestito” regime provided for by Article 7 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (“Decree No. 461”). All the above categories are qualified as “net recipients.” _Noteholders Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_ In the event that the Italian resident Noteholders described under clauses (a) and (c) above are engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax. Interest will be subject to 26% imposta sostitutiva on a provisional basis and will then be included in the relevant Italian resident noteholder’s annual income tax return. As a consequence, Interest will be subject to the ordinary income tax and imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a credit that can be offset against the income tax due. Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a foreign company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest from the Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva. They must, however, be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and are therefore subject to the Italian corporate tax (“IRES”), levied at the rate of 24% although certain surcharges may apply and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, the Italian regional tax on productive activities (“IRAP”), generally levied at the base rate of 3.9%, even though regional surcharges may apply. _Long-term Savings Accounts_ Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are effectively connected or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and No. 103 of February 10, 1996, may be exempt from any income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva on Interest, if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth by Article 1 (100-114) of Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016 (the “Finance",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Moreover, subject to certain conditions and depending on the status and percentage of participation held, income realized by RE Funds and RE SICAFs is attributed to the relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands irrespective of its actual collection and in proportion to the percentage of ownership of units/shares on a tax transparency basis. _Funds and SICAV and Non-Real Estate SICAFs_ Where an Italian resident Noteholder is an open-ended or closed-ended collective investment fund other than RE Funds (a “Fund”) or Società di Investimento a Capitale Variabile (“SICAV”) or a non-real estate SICAF established in Italy and either (i) the Fund or SICAV or non-real estate SICAF or (ii) its manager is subject to the 263 ----- supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest accrued during the holding period on the Notes will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the management results of the Fund, SICAV or non-real estate SICAF. The Fund, the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF will not be subject to taxation on such management results, but a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will instead apply in certain circumstances to income realized by certain categories of unitholders or shareholders (as applicable) in case of distribution, redemption or sales of the units or shares. _Pension Funds_ Where an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by article 17 of the Legislative Decree of December 5, 2005, n. 252) and the Notes are deposited with an Intermediary (as defined below), Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to imposta _sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the pension fund accrued at the end of the tax period (which will_ be subject to a 20% substitute tax on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year). Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period) and several limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment), Interest relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the Pension Fund Tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo _termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1, paragraphs 100 to 114 of Finance Act 2017, as well as_ the requirements set forth in Article 1 (210-215) of Finance Act 2019 as implemented by the Ministerial Decree of April 30, 2019, and, for long-term individual savings accounts established from January 1, 2020, by Article 13 bis of Law Decree No. 124, as amended and supplemented from time to time. _Enforcement of Imposta Sostitutiva_ Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the imposta sostitutiva is applied by Italian resident banks, società di _intermediazione mobiliare (“SIM”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del Risparmio (“SGR”),_ stockbrokers and other entities identified by a decree of the Ministry of Finance or Italian permanent establishment of equivalent foreign entities (each, an “Intermediary”). An Intermediary must: (a) (i) be resident in Italy, or (ii) be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial intermediary, or (iii) be an entity or a company not resident in Italy, acting through a system of centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Italian Tax Authorities having appointed an Italian representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239; and (b) intervene, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change in Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited. Where the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by the relevant Intermediary paying interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct the suffered imposta sostitutiva from income taxes due. _Non-Italian Resident Noteholders_ Where the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident, payments of Interest in respect of the Notes issued by the Issuer will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva at the rate of 26% provided that: (a) the payments are made to non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes with no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected; and (b) such beneficial owners are residents, for tax purposes, in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy is listed in the White List; and (c) all the requirements and procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules, as subsequently amended, in order to benefit from the exemption from imposta sostitutiva are timely met and complied with. 264 ----- Decree No. 239 also provides for additional exemptions from the imposta sostitutiva for payments of Interest in respect of the Notes made to: (a) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; (b) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy listed in the White List, and provided that they timely file with the relevant depositary an appropriate self-declaration of being an institutional investor; or (c) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State. In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must be the beneficial owners of the payments of Interest (institutional investors not subject to tax are deemed to be beneficial owners of the payments of Interest by operation of law) and must: (a) deposit in due time, directly or indirectly, the Notes with a resident bank or a SIM or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or a SIM or with a non-Italian resident entity or company participating in a centralized securities management system which is in contact, via computer, with the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance having appointed an Italian representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239 (Euroclear and Clearstream are such a depositary); and (b) file with the relevant depository, in due time, a statement of the relevant Noteholder (auto-certificazione), which remains valid until withdrawn or revoked, in which the Noteholder declares to be eligible to benefit from the applicable exemption from imposta sostitutiva. This statement, which is not required for international bodies or entities set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy nor in the case of foreign central banks or entities which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State, must comply with the requirements set forth by the Ministerial Decree of December 12, 2001. Failure of a non-resident Noteholder to timely comply with the procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules will result in the application of imposta sostitutiva on Interest payments to a non-resident Noteholder. Noteholders who are subject to the imposta sostitutiva might, nevertheless, be eligible for full or partial relief under an applicable tax treaty between Italy and their country of residence, subject to timely filing of required documentation provided by Measure of the Director of Italian Revenue Agency No. 2013/84404 of July 10, 2013.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Double taxation treaties entered into by Italy may also apply, allowing for a lower (or, in certain cases, nil) rate of withholding tax in case of payments to non-Italian resident Noteholders, subject to compliance with relevant subjective and procedural requirements.

This rule applies where (a) the new tranche of notes is issued within twelve months of the issue date of the previous tranche of notes and (b) the difference between the issue price of the new tranche of notes and that of the original tranche of notes does not exceed 1% multiplied by the number of years of the duration of the notes. 265 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Under certain conditions and limitations, noteholders may set off any capital losses with their capital gain. In respect of the application of the substitute tax on capital gains, taxpayers may opt for any of the three regimes described below. _Tax Declaration Regime_ Under the “tax declaration regime” (regime della dichiarazione), which is the default regime for Italian resident individuals not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the 26% substitute tax on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains (net of any incurred capital loss of the same kind) realized by the Italian resident individual holding the Notes, during any given tax year. Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity must indicate the overall capital gains realized in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss of the same kind, in their annual tax return and pay the substitute tax on such gains of the same kind together with any balance of income tax due for such year. Capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four succeeding tax years. _Risparmio Amministrato Regime_ As an alternative to the tax declaration regime, Italian resident individual Noteholders holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity may elect to pay the substitute tax separately on capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (risparmio amministrato regime provided for by Article 6 of Decree No. 461). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to: i. the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediaries); and ii. a valid express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being timely made in writing by the relevant Noteholder. The depository is responsible for accounting for the substitute tax in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss. The depository must also pay the substitute tax on capital gains to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any possible capital loss resulting from a sale or redemption of the Notes may be deducted only from capital gains subsequently realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains in the annual tax return. _Risparmio Gestito Regime_ In the risparmio gestito regime, any capital gains realized by Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity and who have entrusted the management of their financial assets (including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary, will be included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized, at tax year-end, subject to a 26% substitute tax, to be paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Any depreciation of the managed assets accrued at the tax year-end may be carried forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. The Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains realized in its annual tax return. Subject to certain limitations (including amount and composition of the capital investment) and requirements (including a minimum holding period), capital gains in respect of Notes realized upon sale, transfer or redemption by Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity may be exempt from any income taxation, including the 26% substitute tax on capital gains, if the Notes are 266 ----- included in a long-term individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) pursuant Article 1, paragraphs 100 – 114, of Finance Act 2017 as well as the requirements set forth in Article 1 (211-215) of Law No. 145 of Finance Act 2019, and, for long-term individual savings accounts established from January 1, 2020, by Article 13 bis of Law Decree No. 124, as amended and supplemented from time to time. _Noteholders Engaged in an Entrepreneurial Activity_ Any capital gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be treated as part of taxable income (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of net value of the production for IRAP purposes) if realized by (i) an Italian company or a similar commercial entity; (ii) an Italian resident commercial partnership, (iii) an Italian permanent establishment of foreign entities to which the Notes are effectively connected or (iv) an Italian resident individual engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected. _RE Funds and RE SICAF_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which is an Italian RE Fund or an Italian RE SICAF are exempt from any income tax at the level of the RE Fund or RE SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax will apply in certain circumstances at the rate of 26% to income realized by unitholders or shareholders of the Re Fund/RE SICAF on distributions made by Italian RE Funds/RE SICAF or upon redemption or disposal of the units or the shares (as applicable). Subject to certain conditions and depending on the status and percentage of participation held, income realized by RE Funds and RE SICAFs is attributed to the relevant investors and subject to tax in their hands, irrespective of its actual collection and in proportion to the percentage of ownership of units on a tax transparency basis. _Funds and SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is a non-real estate Italian Fund or a non-real estate SICAF or a SICAV will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period which is exempt from any income tax. A 26% withholding tax will apply in certain circumstances, to distributions by the Italian Fund or non-real estate SICAF or SICAV or received by certain categories of unitholders or shareholders upon redemption or disposal or sale of the units or the shares (as applicable). _Pension Funds_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder who is an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree of December 5, 2005, n. 252) will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to a 20% substitute tax.

If none of the above conditions above is met, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets may be subject to the substitute tax at the current rate of 26%. However, non-Italian resident Noteholders might benefit from an applicable tax treaty with Italy providing that capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the tax residence country of the recipient. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to the _risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on_ capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-Italian residents file in time with the authorized financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from the competent tax authorities of their country of residence.

This was intended to prevent overlap between the EU Savings Tax Directive and the new automatic exchange of information regime to be implemented under Council Directive 2011/16/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the field of Taxation (as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU). The new regime under Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is in accordance with the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in July 2014. Council Directive 2011/16/EU (as amended) is generally broader in scope than the EU Saving Tax Directive, although it does not impose withholding taxes. Italy has enacted Italian Law No. 95 of June 18, 2015 (“Law 95/2015”), implementing the CRS (and the amended EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation) Italian Ministerial Decree dated December 28, 2015, which has entered into force on January 1, 2016, has implemented Law 95/2015 and has provided for the exchange of information starting from the calendar year 2016. In the event that holders of the Notes hold the Notes through an Italian financial institution (as defined in the Italian Ministerial Decree of December 28, 2015 implementing Law 95/2015), they may be required to provide additional information to such financial institution to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Italian implementation of the CRS.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a US Holder (as defined below), except for discussions on Additional Notes (under “—Additional Notes”) and FATCA (under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any US federal tax laws other than US federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-US tax laws. This discussion is based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), US Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the US Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Notes. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the Notes for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (that is, the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash). This discussion does not address all US federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation: - US expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax; - US Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the US dollar; - persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment; - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement; - banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions; - real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies; - brokers, dealers or traders in securities; - “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid US federal income tax; - S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes (and investors therein); - tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; and - persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. For purposes of this discussion, a “US Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note who or that is, for US federal income tax purposes, any of the following: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable US Treasury Regulations to be treated as a US person. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding the Notes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the US federal income tax consequences to them. 271 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase all the Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased up to a specified amount or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a US registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more US registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the Offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. Certain of the funds advised by CVC and/or any other investors arranged by and designated by CVC and members of management of the Group (or any subset thereof) may place a purchase order for and may be allocated Notes at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue prices set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. The Purchase Agreement will provide that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the US Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes for a period of 60 days after the Issue Date. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A; and (ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are registered as such under the US Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the commencement of this Offering, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not it is participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the US Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes in the European Economic Area to retail investors, defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. 277 ----- Solely for the purposes of each manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the US Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made to list the Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit them to trading on the Euro MTF Market in accordance with the rules and regulations of that exchange. We cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as permitted by applicable law after completing the Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the US Securities Act and the US Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Collateral and _any Future Notes Guarantees—An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit your ability to sell the Notes.”_ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be seven business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the US Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the US Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the US Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, 278 ----- _the Notes Collateral and any Future Notes Guarantees—An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, which may limit your ability to sell the Notes.”_ The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, are currently providing and may provide in the future, investment banking, consultancy, financial advisory, commercial banking and cash management services to the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may be mandated lead arrangers, lead arrangers, managers and/or agents under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Bridge Facility Agreement. The Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering to repay the Bridge Facility, which we refer to as the “Refinancing,” and pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Offering and the Refinancing. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. Furthermore, such entities may act as counterparties to the hedging arrangements we or our affiliates expect to enter into in connection with the Transactions. In connection with these transactions, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have received and will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such capacities. The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch or its affiliates are acting as transfer agent, paying agent, and in other agent roles for the Notes. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the Issuer’s securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company (subject to certain exceptions) is the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) in which the relevant company’s centre of main interests (“COMI”) (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) is situated. COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time, but is determined for the purposes of deciding which court has competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition: moreover, the determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1), second sentence, of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” Under Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation there is, in most cases, a rebuttable presumption that a corporate debtor has its centre of main interests in the EU Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. The presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another EU Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, where the company’s central administration is located in an EU Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other EU Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the centre of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU Member State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU Member State have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Recast Insolvency Regulation and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one EU Member State under the Recast Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member State (other than Denmark), although secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another EU Member State (other than Denmark). If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is in an EU Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary insolvency proceedings or 283 ----- territorial insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (as defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings that are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU Member State are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other EU Member State. Where main proceedings in the EU Member State in which the debtor has its centre of main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the EU Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under the conditions laid down by that EU Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the EU Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the EU Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings usually become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Under Article 8 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the opening of insolvency proceedings in a EU Member State pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another EU Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all EU Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other EU Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the EU Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other EU Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (for example, the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other EU Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other EU Member State where the debtor has assets). In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. 284 ----- In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing, or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. _Corporate Benefit_ An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (for example, a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (for example, security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of 285 ----- Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity. _Financial Assistance_ In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. _Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_ Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian guarantor. It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Italian guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee could be declared void.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly-owned companies are involved. Insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are expected in the near future.

By virtue of these limitations, an Italian Guarantor’s and/or Italian security provider’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee and/or security interests will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee or security interests. In particular, as regards any Italian Guarantor, given the above limitations in relation to Italian financial assistance law and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement: (i) the Notes Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans or other financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity contributions) advanced or made available from time to time to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359, paragraph 1 and 2, of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Acquisition Closing Date, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Notes Guarantee, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor; provided further that no Italian Guarantor shall be liable as a Guarantor and/or security provider in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that it is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or as a result of the enforcement of any security interests granted by it; (iii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by any Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes;

(iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Banking Act), the obligations of such Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Banking Act, respectively; In the event that the Merger does not occur by September 10, 2022, as regards to BIP, benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement until such time as the Merger is completed (if ever): (i) the Notes Guarantee and security interests to be granted by BIP will only guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes in a proportion equal to which Tranche B bears to the nominal principal amount of the Notes at issuance (the “Refinancing Proportion”) and shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the BIP Funding Loan, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Notes Guarantee or security, net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by BIP; provided further that BIP shall not be liable as a Guarantor and/or security provider in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that it is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by BIP under the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or as a result of the enforcement of any security interests granted by it; (ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by BIP, also in accordance with article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as described under “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as described under “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the Notes;

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests shall be distributed among the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Notes Guarantees and security. In addition, the limitations on the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider (other than BIP) that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be set forth in a supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance. In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement-the security documents relating to the Notes Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests shall be distributed among the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Notes Guarantees and security. _Security Agent, Noteholders’ Representative and Trust_ The Notes Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to 288 ----- Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Notes Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the security documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Notes Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are untested by Italian courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Notes Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Notes Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Notes Collateral. Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante _comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly_ appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court. Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. _Certain Additional Considerations in Relation to Granting Security Interests and Guarantees_ Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quota-holder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as _società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._ Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Notes Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted. 289 ----- _Certain Limitations on Enforcement_ The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws Considerations—Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento).” If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, guarantees, security interest, and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the judge; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto); - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; 290 ----- - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/ attachment) at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, inter alia, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian Usury Law, as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act) may not be enforceable; - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/ shares. 291 ----- In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been postponed to September 1, 2021 by the Law Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020 (the “Liquidity Decree”), as converted by Law No. 40 of June 5, 2020, and is now scheduled for May 16, 2022, except for the section named _Parte Prima-Titolo II (i.e., the new preventive alert and mediation phase), which will entry into force on_ December 31, 2023, pursuant to Article 1 of the Law Decree No. 118 dated August 24, 2021 (the “Law Decree",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Law Decree 118/2021 needs to be",340.5.1,(ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 asking the court to,"authorize certain acts, or to modify the conditions of certain contracts if, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur. The composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore _commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with reference to their_ assets, their business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow, notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian Bankruptcy Law are not met. Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi may also apply to corporate groups. The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with the filing of a petition for the appointment of an independent expert (the “Expert”), through a digital platform (the “Platform”). Together with the petition, the enterprises must file the documents listed under Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Law Decree 118/2021, collectively aimed at giving a clear representation of their financial status and indebtedness. The Expert is appointed by a three-member commission instituted by the chamber of commerce of the City constituting the “capoluogo” of the relevant Italian Region, formed by a judge, a member appointed by the chamber of commerce’s president and a member appointed by the prefect. The Expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and/or qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and certain additional requirements aimed at ensuring its independence towards the entrepreneur. The Expert assesses his/her independence, the adequacy of his/her professional expertise and his/her time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is positive, notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the Platform. In case of negative outcome, the Expert confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a new Expert. If the Expert accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are concrete chances of recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally, and can be assisted by its counsels. If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. The entrepreneur must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation, and manage his/her assets without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and, in case of credit assignment and/or transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations actively and in an informed manner, and the access to the composizione negoziata della crisi does not, by itself, constitute ground for withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions apply to negotiations involving employment contracts. If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she notifies the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any). 293 ----- Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures. The relevant petition is published in the companies’ register together with the Expert’s acceptance. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims. From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the entrepreneur cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent. The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. On the same date of the filing of the petition with the companies’ register requesting the application of the Protective Measures, the entrepreneur requests the court to confirm or amend the Protective Measures, and, if necessary, to enact the Interim Measures. If the entrepreneur fails to file such petition to the court, the Protective Measures are ineffective. Additionally, if the entrepreneur fails to request the publication of the case number (numero di ruolo generale) assigned by the court within 30 days from the publication of the petition with the companies’ register, the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures is canceled from the companies’ register. Within 10 days from the filing of the petition requesting to confirm or amend the Protective Measures, and, if necessary, to enact the Interim Measures, the courts schedules a hearing, and upon failure of scheduling such hearing the Protective Measures will become ineffective. At the hearing, the court hears the parties, the Expert and the creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures and the Interim Measures. The court can appoint a court expert and carry out all the relevant investigation measures. The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days. Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations, or appear to be disproportionate compared to the prejudice caused to the creditors that file the relevant request. Pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery. If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with in the companies’ register. When Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court which may revoke such measures or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize: (a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) via shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. 294 ----- The Expert may invite the parties to renegotiate in good faith the conditions of certain contracts (other than employment contracts) if, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, such contracts pose an excessive burden on the entrepreneur. If the parties do not agree, the entrepreneur can file a petition asking the court to amend the conditions of such contracts. Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as follow: (a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree 118/2021 if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years; (b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law without the need for an independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided thereby. At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182 bis, Article 182 septies or Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Alternatively, the entrepreneur may: (a) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio pursuant to Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021; (c) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in the so-called _Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure._ Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021: (i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione _dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta_ amministrativa),_ extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione _straordinaria) or concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio;_ (ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made; (iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register or if the court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021; (iv) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio). If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome, and that the options provided under Article 11, Paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file a petition for admission to the concordato _semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under_ 295 ----- Article 161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The petition for concordato _semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the companies’ register within the day_ following the filing with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 111, 167, 168 and 169 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply. The court verifies the formal correctness of the proposal, acquires the Expert’s Final Report and an opinion of the Expert on the possible outcome of the liquidation and the relevant guarantees offered thereunder, and (i) appoints a court expert, (ii)gives order to the entrepreneur to notify the proposal, together with the Expert’s Final Report, to the creditors resulting from the list that was attached to the petition for the appointment of the Expert pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Law Decree 118/2021 and (iii) schedules the hearing for the sanctioning (omologazione) of the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio. The court issues a decree sanctioning (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and_ regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. Apart from the Law Decree 118/2021 and the Insolvency Code, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian Bankruptcy Law (the “Decree”). The Decree entered into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, entered into force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale); and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016. The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. In addition to the composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio described above, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are available under Italian_ law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. The amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, which anticipate certain provisions of the Insolvency Code, will be examined in the following sections.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. 296 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Law Decree 118/2021 needs to be",340.5.3,"Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law","Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of a courtsupervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors or a debt restructuring agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Law Decree 118/2021 needs to be",340.5.4,Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti),"The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the outstanding total amount of the company’s claims or debt restructuring agreements, subject to court’s sanctioning (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the debt of non-adhering creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-adhering creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-adhering creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to preexisting debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182—bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. 297 ----- The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Italian Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di _ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._ The new Article 182 bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69 of May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan. If substantial amendments are made to the plan prior to the court’s sanctioning (omologazione), (i) the independent expert carries out a new assessment on the truthfulness of the business and accounting data, the feasibility of the agreement and its attitude to allow payment of the non-adhering creditors within the terms provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and (ii) the debtor requests the creditors to confirm their adherence to the debt restructuring agreement. The independent expert carries out a new assessment also in case of substantial amendments to the debt restructuring agreement. If substantial amendments are made to the plan after to the court’s sanctioning (omologazione), the debtor amends the plan in order to ensure the performance of the obligations provided under the debt restructuring agreement, and requests the independent expert to carry out a new assessment. In this case, the new plan and the new assessment of the independent expert are published in the companies’ register and notice of such publication is given to the creditors by means of certified mail or certified email. Creditors may oppose the new plan within 30 days from the notice of the publication. Pursuant to Article 182, Paragraph 4, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by the Law Decree 118/2021, the court can sanction the debt restructuring agreement also if the Italian Tax Authority or the Italian Social Security Authority do not adhere, provided that their adherence is essential in order to reach the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and that the claims of the non-adhering Italian Tax Authority and Italian Social Security Authority are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the debt restructuring agreement than as what would be the case in bankruptcy. The adherence of the Italian Tax Authority and of the Italian Social Security Authority must occur within 90 days from the filing of the debt restructuring agreement proposal. Pursuant to the new Article 182 novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is reduced to the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under Article 182 bis, Paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) does not previously file a petition for admission to the concordato in bianco pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article 182 octies, Article 182 novies and Article 182 decies, thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Insolvency Code. Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements by obtaining approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a so-called “cramdown”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-adhering creditors are not treated worse than under any effectively available alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a non-liquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa). If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of non-adhering creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the agreement and refuse to be forced into it. The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi. 298 ----- Pursuant to the new Article 182 septies, Paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries and have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-adhering creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind non-adhering creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Law Decree 118/2021 needs to be",340.5.5,(iii) the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the,"recovery strategies undertaken by the debtor, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations and have been kept informed). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same. The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182 septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the standstill agreement provided under Article 182 octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-adhering creditors. Pursuant to the new Article 182 decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-adhering creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e. before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court- supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors. The same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount. Moreover, pursuant to Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested to: (i) incur in new super senior (prededucibile) indebtedness subject to authorization by the court; (ii) secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors; and (iii) pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. The aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to Article 182 quinquies, Paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182- bis, Paragraph1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 299 ----- of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called _prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_ debtor, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the debtor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Law Decree 118/2021 needs to be",340.5.6,Court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo),"A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding tax years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding tax years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (for example, concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco). The debtor company may not file such preliminary petition where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. 300 ----- Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business, pending the _concordato in bianco, as well as the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to_ Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are treated as super-senior (so called _prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security_ interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the business continues to be run by the debtor as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge. The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior judge’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The concordato preventivo is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of their claim (provided that they receive, at least, an amount equal to the fair market value of their secured assets, as assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. 301 ----- The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy courtsupervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e. a pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy court-supervised composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and sanctioned (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (for example, employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid according to the concordato preventivo proposal. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Among such legislative measures, the Italian Government enacted the Liquidity Decree. Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree provides, among other things, the extension of 6 months of the deadlines for fulfillment of the obligations provided in a sanctioned concordato preventivo or accordo di ristrutturazione dei _debiti based on a plan expiring after February 23, 2020. In the procedures for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a concordato preventivo and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pending on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for the grant of an_ extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato preventivo in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to 302 ----- Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a _concordato preventivo in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities_ were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Also, a set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/pre-insolvency scenarios. The rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different company type) of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with respect to losses arisen in the financial year ended on 31 December 2020 and until the five subsequent financial years. This measure, originally provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree, subsequently replaced by Article 1, Paragraph 266, of Law No. 178 of 30 December 2020, is intended to address the risk that the impact of losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic on the share capital of companies push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following: (i) putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal liability as a result of the delay in complying with such obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Law Decree 118/2021 needs to be",340.5.8,Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento),"A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding tax years; (ii) has_ had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding tax years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the authorization of the designated judge. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration is suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to decide whether to continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a designated judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the 303 ----- liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - **Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors or third parties starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the bankruptcy’s estate (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of their claim (provided that they receive, at least, an amount equal to the fair market value of their secured assets, as assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part, provided that they do not receive less than the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert). The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. Please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of 304 ----- bankruptcy, without need to wait until the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the designated judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The main innovations of the Law Decree 118/2021 are the following: (i) additional postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code; (ii) introduction of a new a negotiated composition proceeding (composizione negoziata della crisi) and of a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato _semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio);_ (iii) amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which anticipate certain provisions of the Insolvency Code. 292 ----- The postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code, and the amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law, are effective as of August 25, 2021 (i.e., the day following the publication of the Law Decree 118/2021 in the Gazzetta Ufficiale), while the composizione negoziata della crisi and the concordato semplificato per la _liquidazione del patrimonio are effective as of November 15, 2021. Accordingly, the practical consequences of_ the implementation of such reforms cannot to date be foreseen in their entirety. The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021 requesting the court to confirm or modify the protective measures (the “Protective Measures”), and, if necessary, to enact the interim measures necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures”), and",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario _giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization._ The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within 10 days from such filing, the Ministry of the Economic Development (the “Ministry”) may release an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration proceeding. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the judicial receiver’s report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the judicial phase. 306 ----- The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years.

It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (for example, in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario _liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee_ (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure.

The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (for example, payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor.

Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Article 2929-bis of the Italian Civil Code, provides for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (for example, gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”).

Milapax Lux is incorporated in Luxembourg and has its centre of main interests (centre des intérêts principaux), for the purpose of the EU Insolvency Regulation, and its registered office and central administration (administration centrale) in Luxembourg. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws may affect this entity. _The following is a brief description of the key features of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings and certain aspects of insolvency laws in Luxembourg. Luxembourg insolvency proceedings._ Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, the following types of insolvency proceedings (together referred to as “Insolvency Proceedings”) may be opened against Milapax Lux to the extent that Milapax Lux has its central administration (administration centrale) or its centre of main interests (centre des intérêts principaux) (for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in Luxembourg: - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite); - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée); and - preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite). In addition to these Insolvency Proceedings, the ability of the holders of the Notes to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of the Commercial District Court (Tribunal d’arrondissement siégeant en _matière commerciale) granting suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) or putting Milapax Lux into_ judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). 308 ----- _Bankruptcy proceedings (faillite) General administration of bankruptcy proceedings_ The opening of bankruptcy proceedings may be requested by Milapax Lux or by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the Commercial District Court having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings in the event that Milapax Lux (a) has ceased to make payments (cessation de paiements) and (b) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If the Commercial District Court considers that these conditions are met, it may open bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion, absent a request made by Milapax Lux or a creditor. The managers/directors of Milapax Lux have the obligation to file for bankruptcy within one month in case Milapax Lux is in a state of cessation of payment (cessation de paiements) and loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If the Commercial District Court declares a company bankrupt, it will appoint one or more bankruptcy receivers (curateur(s)), depending on the complexity of the proceedings and a supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) to supervise the bankruptcy proceedings. The period within which creditors must file their proof of claims (déclaration de créance) is specified in the judgment adjudicating the company bankrupt. Claims filed after such period may nevertheless be taken into account by the bankruptcy receiver subject to certain limitations as to distributable proceeds. The bankruptcy receiver takes over the management and control of Milapax Lux in place of the managers. The bankruptcy receiver will realize assets of Milapax Lux and distribute the proceeds to the creditors of Milapax Lux in accordance with the statutory order of payment and, if there are any funds left, to the bankrupt company’s shareholders. The bankruptcy receiver represents Milapax Lux as well as the creditors collectively (masse des _créanciers)._ The bankruptcy receiver will need to obtain of the Commercial District Court permission for certain acts, such as agreeing to a settlement of claims or deciding to pursue the business of Milapax Lux during the bankruptcy proceedings. Bankruptcy is governed by public policy and rules, which generally delay the process and limit restructuring options of the group to which the bankrupt company belongs. On closing of the bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt company will normally be dissolved. _Effects of bankruptcy proceedings_ The main effect of bankruptcy proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against Milapax Lux, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured creditors, and the payment of unsecured creditors of Milapax Lux in accordance with their rank upon the realization of the assets of Milapax Lux. In principle, contracts of the bankrupt company are not automatically terminated on commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, save for contracts for which the identity or solvency of the company was crucial (intuitu _personae agreements) for the other party. However, certain contracts are terminated automatically by law, such_ as employment contracts, unless expressly confirmed by the receiver. Contractual provisions purporting to terminate a contract upon bankruptcy are generally held as being valid. The receiver may choose to terminate contracts of the company subject to the rule of “exceptio non adimpleti contractus” and the creditors’ interest. Unsecured claims of the creditors of Milapax Lux will, in the event of a liquidation of Milapax Lux, only rank after (i) the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and (ii) the debts of Milapax Lux that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, inter alia: - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise; - social security contributions; and - remuneration owed to employees. - For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors of Milapax Lux (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized and subject to application of the relevant priority rules, liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law). During insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors of Milapax Lux are suspended. 309 ----- Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by Milapax Lux during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is fixed by the Luxembourg court and dates back not more than six months as from the date on which the Luxembourg court formally adjudicates a company bankrupt, and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period. In particular: pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, some transactions in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts, save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Luxembourg act of 5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the Collateral Act",N/A,as_expected,2021,540
630_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,340,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES COLLATERAL AND ANY FUTURE NOTES GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,340.8,"2005), the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of",340.8.1,,"assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange (unless, arguably, that method of payment was agreed from inception), transactions without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside, if so requested by the bankruptcy receiver; pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration after the cessation of payments (cessation de paiements) and before judgments declaring the bankruptcy (i.e., during the suspect period) are subject to setting aside by the Commercial District Court upon proceedings initiated by the bankruptcy receiver, if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of payments; and pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. _Controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée) General administration of controlled management proceedings_ Milapax Lux, which has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) or which is not in a position to completely fulfil its obligations, can apply for the regime of controlled management in order either (i) to restructure its business or (ii) to realize its assets in good conditions. An application for controlled management can only be made by Milapax Lux. The loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) is identical to the credit test applied in bankruptcy proceedings. As to the second criteria (that is, the case where a company is not in a position to completely fulfil its obligations), a broad view of the total situation of the Issuer is taken. Controlled management proceedings is only available for good-faith debtor. Controlled management proceedings are rarely used as they are not often successful and generally lead to bankruptcy proceedings. They are occasionally applied to companies, in particular holding or finance companies, which are part of an international group and whose inability to meet obligations results from a default of group companies. The proceedings are divided into three steps: Milapax Lux must file an application with the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court can reject the application because (i) Milapax Lux has already been declared bankrupt or (ii) the evidence brought forward by Milapax Lux does not ensure the stabilization and the normal exercise of the business of Milapax Lux or improve the realization of the assets of Milapax Lux in better conditions. If the application is upheld at this stage, the Commercial District Court will appoint an investigating judge (juge délégué) to make a report on the overall situation of Milapax Lux. Once the investigating judge has delivered a report, the Commercial District Court may (i) turn down the application on the ground that the proposals made by the applicant are unlikely to lead to the reorganization of the business or the realization of the assets in better conditions or (ii) appoint one or more administrators (commissaires) who will supervise the management of the assets of Milapax Lux. If the Commercial District Court ascertains that Milapax Lux is unable to pay its creditors (i.e. Milapax Lux has ceased its payments (cessation de paiements)), it may set the date as from which Milapax Lux will be deemed to have been in such situation. Such date may be set up to six months prior to the filing of application for controlled management proceedings. However, bankruptcy may only be declared if the two conditions for bankruptcy are met (cessation of payment (cessation de paiements) and loss of commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit)), and if the application has been dismissed either before or after consideration of the report by the investigating judge or after the reorganization plan proposed by the administrators (commissaires) at the third step described below. The 310 ----- administrators will draw up the inventory of the assets as well as the financial situation of the Issuer. They are also in charge of the annual accounts of Milapax Lux. The administrators may also prescribe any act they consider to be in the interests of the applicant or its creditors. The administrators have to be convened to any meeting of the board of managers. They may attend all board meetings but have no voting rights. They have the right to convene such board meetings. The administrators will draft a reorganization plan in respect of the applicant’s business or a plan for realization of the assets, within the deadlines set forth by the Commercial District Court. The plan shall equitably take into account all interests involved and will comply with the ranking of mortgages (hypothèques) and privileges (privilèges) as required by law, without taking into account any contractual clause regarding termination, penalties or acceleration. The administrators will notify the draft plan to the creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. Within fifteen days of such notification or publication, the creditors will inform the Commercial District Court whether they agree or object to the draft plan. Any creditor who abstains will be considered as having adhered to the plan. The creditors, the company, the joint debtors and the guarantors may submit written observations to the Commercial District Court. The Commercial District Court may (i) approve the plan if a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been challenged by the administrators, at least half of the Issuer’s liabilities have agreed thereto or (ii) disagree with the plan proposed by the administrators even though a majority of the creditors representing, via their claims which have not been challenged by the administrators, at least half of the company’s liabilities have agreed to such plan, in which case the application for controlled management will be dismissed or (iii) ask the administrators to propose an amended plan (such amended plan will have to be submitted again to the creditors). The judgment approving the plan will be binding upon the company and its creditors, joint debtors and guarantors. The fees of the administrators will be fixed by the Commercial District Court and will be borne by the company. The administrators who at the same time are creditors of the applicant are not entitled to any fees. _Effects of a controlled management proceedings_ As from the day of the appointment of the investigating judge and up to the final decision on the application for controlled management, any subsequent enforcement proceedings or acts, even if initiated by privileged creditors (including creditors who have the benefit of pledges (gages) and mortgages (hypothèques)) are stayed, save as provided for by the Collateral Act 2005. The Issuer may not enter into any act of disposition, mortgage and contract or accept any movable asset without the authorization of the investigating judge. Once the administrators have been appointed, Milapax Lux may not carry out any act (including receiving funds, lending money, granting any security, or making any payment) without the prior authorization of the administrators. The administrators may bring any action before the Commercial District Court in order to have any act made in violation of the legislation governing the controlled management or in fraud of the creditors’ rights be set aside. Subject to the prior authorization of the Commercial District Court, they may bring an action (i) to have the managers or the statutory auditor be held liable or (ii) if the Commercial District Court has declared the company to be in cessation of payments, to have certain payments, compensations or security interests be set aside (under certain conditions set forth in Articles 445 et seq. of the Luxembourg code of commerce). _Preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite) General administration of preventive composition proceedings_ Milapax Lux may enter into a preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite) in order to resolve its financial difficulties by entering into an agreement with its creditors, the purpose of which is to avoid bankruptcy. Preventive composition proceedings may only be applied for by a company which is in financial difficulty. Similar to controlled management proceedings, the preventive composition proceedings are not available if the company has already been declared bankrupt by the Commercial District Court or if the company is acting in bad faith. The application for the preventive composition proceedings can only be made by Milapax Lux and must be supported by proposals of preventive composition. The Commercial District Court will delegate to a delegated judge (juge délégué) the duty to verify, and to prepare a report on, the situation of Milapax Lux. Based on such report, the Commercial District Court will decide whether or not to pursue the preventive composition proceedings. If the Commercial District Court considers that the procedure should not be pursued, it will in the same judgment declare the bankruptcy of the company (which bankruptcy may also be declared during the preventive composition proceedings if the conditions for the composition proceedings are not met). If the Commercial District Court considers that the 311 ----- procedure may be pursued, it will set the place, date and hour of a meeting (assemblée concordataire) at which the creditors will be convened. The delegated judge will make its report at the assemblée concordataire. The preventive composition may only be adopted if a majority of the creditors representing, by their unchallenged claims, three-quarters of the debt of Milapax Lux, has adhered to the proposal and if the preventive composition has been homologated by the Commercial District Court. Creditors benefiting from mortgages (hypothèques), privileges (privilèges) or pledges (gages) only have a deliberating voice in the operations of the concordat, if they renounce the benefit of their mortgages, privileges or pledges. The vote in favor of the concordat entails renunciation. The renunciation may be limited by the secured creditors to only a portion (but representing at least 50% in value) of their claims with corresponding voting rights. The preventive composition has no effect on the claims secured by a mortgage, a privilege or a pledge and on claims by the tax authorities. If the application results in a preventive composition arrangement sanctioned by the Commercial District Court, the preventive composition could still either be annulled (if it has not been executed) or terminated (in case of fraud or bad faith of the company). In such scenarios, the Commercial District Court may adjudicate bankrupt Milapax Lux. The bankruptcy judgment can decide to set the date of cessation of payment to the date of the application for the preventive composition proceedings. If that date is less than six months prior to the bankruptcy judgment, the court can of course set the cessation of payment date at six months prior to its judgment. Preventive composition proceedings are rarely used in practice since they are not binding upon secured creditors. _Effects of a preventive composition proceedings_ The business activities of Milapax Lux continue during the preventive composition proceedings. While the preventive composition is being negotiated, Milapax Lux may not dispose of, or grant any security over, any assets without the approval of the delegated judge. Once the preventive composition has been agreed by the Commercial District Court, this restriction is lifted. However, the business activities of Milapax Lux will still be supervised by the delegated judge. Except as provided for in Collateral Act 2005, while the preventive composition is being negotiated, unsecured creditors may not take action against the company to recover their claims. Secured creditors who do not participate in the preventive composition proceedings may take action against Milapax Lux to recover their claims and to enforce their security. Fraudulent transactions which took place before the date on which the Commercial District Court commenced preventive composition proceedings may be set aside (please see the bankruptcy proceedings section above). _Suspension of payments proceedings (sursis de paiements) General administration of a suspension of payments proceedings_ A suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) for commercial companies is different from the sursis de _paiement proceedings available to banks and insurance companies. It can only be applied to a company which, as_ a result of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to temporarily cease its payments but which has on the basis of its balance sheet sufficient assets to pay all amounts due to its creditors. The suspension of payments may also be granted if the situation of the applicant, even though showing a loss, presents serious elements of reestablishment of the balance between its assets and its debts. The purpose of the suspension of payments proceedings is to allow a business undertaking experiencing financial difficulties to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex proceeding involving both the Commercial District Court and the Cour supérieure de justice and the approval by a majority of the creditors representing, by their claims, three-quarters of the company’s debts (excluding claims secured by privilege (privilège), mortgage (hypothèque) or pledge (gage)). The suspension of payments is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main reasons it has lost its attractiveness. It only applies to those liabilities which have been assumed by the debtor prior to obtaining the suspension of payment and has no effect as far as taxes and other public charges or secured claims (by right of privilege, a mortgage or a pledge) are concerned. _Effects of suspension of payments proceedings_ During the suspension of payments, ordinary creditors cannot open enforcement proceedings against Milapax Lux or the assets of Milapax Lux. This stay on enforcement does not extend to preferred creditors, or to creditors which are secured by mortgages (hypothèques), pledges (gages) or financial collateral arrangements governed by the Collateral Act 2005. Milapax Lux continues to manage its own business under the supervision of a courtappointed administrator who must approve most of the transactions carried out by Milapax Lux. 312 ----- When a suspension of payments ends, the stay on enforcement is terminated and the managers of Milapax Lux can run the business again. _Judicial liquidation_ Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of Luxembourg act of August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the “Companies Law 1915”). The management of such judicial liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to bankruptcy proceedings. _Exceptional measures taken by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in response to the COVID-19 pandemic_ It should be noted that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has exceptionally taken, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain measures including a suspension of certain procedural deadlines applicable in civil and commercial matters. This suspension of delays applies to the one month procedural time-limit for the insolvency filing obligation provided by article 440 of the Luxembourg commercial code. In principle, such a suspension of delays should (i) not prevent directors / managers of a Luxembourg company from filing for bankruptcy (if the conditions thereof are met) and (ii) not restrict the rights of creditors to petition for bankruptcy of a Luxembourg company. Based on the current legislation, suspension of delays to file for bankruptcy within one month should remain in place until December 31, 2021. _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests Creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests_ According to Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the security interests (such as a pledge) are situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of pledges over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. The Collateral Act 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares (such as shares in Luxembourg private limited liability companies) located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Collateral Act 2005, the perfection of pledges depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge over shares in a Luxembourg private limited liability company must be (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (subject to the pledge) and/or (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including, but not limited: - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties; - sell or cause the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at normal commercial terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange (if listed shares) or (iii) by way of a public auction; - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the pledges might be substantially delayed. The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including pledges and transfer of title by way of security) including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable, even if entered into during 313 ----- the hardening period, against third parties including supervisory, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization affecting any one of the parties. The perfection of the pledges created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the security providers through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). Finally, the appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the extent that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions depending on the type of security interests. Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the Collateral Act 2005, a financial collateral may be granted in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral takers, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis third-party beneficiaries of such financial collateral, persons acting on behalf of the third-party beneficiaries of a financial collateral, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of a financial collateral under the Collateral Act 2005. 314 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The majority of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United States. The majority of the Issuer’s directors, officers and other executives are expected to be neither residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore, the majority of the Issuer’s assets are located outside the United States. As a result, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any such other non-US resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a US court predicated upon civil liabilities under US federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons or the Issuer or to enforce against them or the Issuer judgments of US courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of US federal or state securities laws despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Indentures, the Issuer has appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other jurisdictions (including Italy) upon those persons or the Issuer or over the Issuer’s respective subsidiaries provided that, for example, The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. If a judgment is obtained in a US court against the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets.

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by a US court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in Italy to that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set out above.

The fundamental principles introduced when the Board first issued IFRS 17 in May 2017 remain unaffected. The amendments, which respond to feedback from stakeholders, are designed to: reduce costs by simplifying some requirements in the Standard; make financial performance easier to explain; and ease transition by deferring the effective date of the Standard to 2023 and by providing additional relief to reduce the effort required when applying IFRS 17 for the first time; - in January 2020, the IASB issued Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1), which affects the requirements in IAS 1 for the presentation of liabilities, including clarifying one of the criteria for classifying a liability as non-current. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, with earlier adoption permitted. In July 2020, the IASB deferred the effective date of this amendment to 1 January 2023; - in February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Change in Accounting Estimates and Errors. The amendments to IAS 1 require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies, including providing guidance on how to apply the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments to IAS 8 clarify how companies should distinguish change in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with earlier application permitted; - on 31 March 2021, the IASB published an additional amendment to IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – COVID-19 related rent concessions extension of the practical expedient to extend the date of the practical expedient from 30 June 2021 to 30 June 2022. Lessees can elect to account for such rent concessions in the same way as they would if they were not lease modifications. In many cases, this will result in accounting for the concession as variable lease payments in the period(s) in which the event or condition that triggers the reduced payment occurs. The effective date refers to annual period beginning on or after April 2021; - in May 2021, the IASB issued targeted amendments to IAS 12 – Income Taxes, to specify how companies should recognize deferred tax on transactions, such as leases and decommissioning obligations, that on initial recognition give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendment should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. In addition, entities should recognise deferred tax assets (to the extent that it is probable that they can be utilised) and deferred tax liabilities at the beginning of the earliest comparative period for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, and decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities, and the corresponding amounts recognised as part of the cost of the related assets.

Personnel expenses included also the following costs to be phased out in subsequent periods related to i) the effects of the share based plan (Class Y shares) for Chaucer employee for Euro 377.329, ii) the cash settled incentives benefits for Chaucer continuing shareholders for Euro 729.814, and iii) the recognition of employee benefits for payments in shares under IFRS 2 amounting to Euro 2,802,852 and related expenses for employee contribution amounting to Euro 923,022. General and administrative expenses slightly increased (6.2%) as a result of the combined effects of the increase in the consolidation area following the Chaucer, Medley and Advantis acquisitions partially offset by the increased focus on overheads and cost saving initiatives implemented in the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic which continued in 2021.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore: - we identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; we design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks; we obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; F-26 ----- - we obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group internal control; - we evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management; - we conclude on the appropriateness of management use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern; - we evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; - we obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

On the acquisition date when control is obtained, the equity of subsidiaries is determined by valuing individual assets and liabilities at their fair value. If the total is less than the purchase consideration, the difference is recognized in the balance sheet as “Goodwill” (hereinafter goodwill); if the total is greater than the purchase consideration, the difference is recognized in the income statement. The shares of net equity and profit for the year attributable to non-controlling interests are recognized separately within equity and in the income statement. In the event full control is not assumed, the share of equity attributable to non-controlling interests is determined based on the share of the fair value attributed to the assets and liabilities on the acquisition date when control is obtained, less any goodwill relating to them (so-called partial goodwill method). In the case in which additional shares are acquired subsequent to assuming control (acquisition of minority interests) any excess of the purchase consideration over the corresponding portion of equity acquired is recognized in equity; in the same way, the effects of the sale of minority shareholdings without loss of control are recognized in equity.

This category also includes debt instruments whose cash flows do not pass the SPPI test or which are held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. On initial recognition, financial assets are measured at cost, which corresponds to fair value plus transaction costs relating to the acquisition. Subsequent measurement depends upon the nature of the instrument. Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: a) the financial asset is held within a business model, the objective of which is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met: - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets other than those measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Acquisition of 68.44% of the share capital of the Chaucer Group,"In June 2020, the Board of Directors of BIP approved the acquisition in several tranches of the entire share capital of Chaucer Management Holdings Limited, the UK parent company of the Chaucer Group. The Chaucer Group is a leading business consultancy in the UK market in the fields of energy, life sciences and public administration, with specific expertise in (i) technology & data, (ii) digital strategy & business and (iii) cultural & behavioural changes. It carries out its consulting activities through the operating companies Chaucer Group Ltd and its subsidiary Virtrium Ltd, both well established in the UK market and with an important focus on multinational clients, and through the operating company Chaucer America Inc, active in the US market. Chaucer Group Ltd and Chaucer America Inc are both wholly owned subsidiaries of the subholding company Chaucer Management Services Ltd, which in turn is wholly owned by Chaucer Management Holdings Ltd. In order to facilitate BIP’s acquisition of the Chaucer Group, on 15 June 2020, BIP Consulting UK Ltd (Newco), a company incorporated under English law, was established, directly owned by BIP, which provided funding for Newco, and the minority shareholders of Chaucer Management Holdings Ltd (Continuing Shareholders), which exchanged part of their shareholdings in Chaucer for shares in Newco, in percentages of 74.99% and 25.01% respectively. The agreement signed with the shareholders of the Chaucer Group provides for the acquisition by BIP of 100% of the share capital of Newco and, in turn, 100% of the share capital of Chaucer Management Holdings Ltd originally held by the majority shareholder, the UK investment fund Growth Capital Partners Ltd (GCP), by the operating Continuing Shareholders and by a further minority of Non-Continuing Shareholders. Specifically, such acquisition is divided into several stages, as summarised below: — the acquisition of a 55.33% (indirect) shareholding in Chaucer Management Holdings Ltd through payment by Newco of the related consideration upon signing the share purchase agreement, as well as a further 13.1% (indirect) interest in Chaucer Management Holdings Ltd through payment of a deferred consideration to be paid to the GCP Fund and the Non-Continuing Shareholders in the first quarter of 2021. — the acquisition of the remaining shares (an indirect shareholding of 31.57%) through put/call option mechanisms for the purchase by BIP or sale by the minority shareholders of Newco (Continuing Shareholders) and Chaucer Management Holdings Ltd (GCP and Non-Continuing Shareholders), to be exercised during the period from Q1 2021 until Q1 2023. As part of the transaction, the Chaucer Group repaid an outstanding loan with the previous shareholder GCP through an intercompany loan received from BIP S.p.A.. In February 2021, BIP accelerated the process by acquiring all of the shares in Chaucer Management Holdings Ltd held directly by GCP (12.5%) and the Non-Continuing Shareholders (0.6%), thereby obtaining an overall 81.55% interest in Chaucer Group (through Newco). Arrangements are also in place for the purchase of the 4.16% held by the Continuing Shareholders which, once realised, will take the Group’s total shareholding (through Newco) to 85.71%.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) As at and for the year ended 31 December 2020 3. Measurement criteria (continued),216.143.2,,"The fair value of listed financial instruments is based on the quoted market price. If the market in question is not active (or the securities are not listed) Group companies determine fair value applying measurement techniques. Investments in equity instruments that do not have quoted prices in active markets and whose fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost. Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life of individual assets, which is the estimated period over which the asset will be used by the Group. This period starts from when the asset is available for use. When the asset includes several significant components with different useful lives, each component is depreciated separately. The value to be depreciated is represented by the book value prior to depreciation and net of any write-downs, reduced by the presumable net realisable value at the end of the asset’s useful life if significant and capable of being reliably determined. Considering the homogeneous nature of the assets included within the categories of property, plant and equipment, the estimated useful lives of the various asset categories, subject to specific exceptions, is as follows: The book value of individual intangible assets is maintained in the financial statements to the extent that there is evidence that such value can be recovered through use. If evidence suggests there may be difficulties in recovering the net book value, an impairment test is carried out. Costs associated with the purchase for use of patents and licenses are capitalized as intangible assets. The cost is represented by the fair value of the price paid to acquire the right and any direct costs incurred to adapt and implement it in the entity’s operating and production environment. The amortization period cannot exceed the shorter of the useful life and the duration of the legal or contractual right. the final year of such time horizon for the purpose of estimating the terminal value. The long-term growth rate used to estimate the terminal value of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) is assumed to be no higher than the average long-term growth rate for the market sector in which the cash-generating unit (or group of units) operates. Future cash flows are estimated with reference to the current conditions of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) and, therefore, neither the benefits resulting from future restructuring to which the entity is not yet committed nor future investments to improve or optimise the unit are considered. For the purpose of impairment testing, the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit is determined in accordance with the method used to determine the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, excluding surplus assets (i.e. financial assets, deferred tax assets and net non-current assets held for sale) and including the portion of goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests. - whether the cash flow of the contractual instruments represents “solely the payment of principal and interest” with respect to the outstanding principal (the ‘SPPI’ criterion). The new classification and measurement of debt instruments are as follows: - Debt instruments at amortised cost for financial assets that are held in a business model that has the objective of holding the financial assets to collect cash flows that meet the SPPI criterion. This category includes Trade and other Group receivables, as well as Loans classified as Other non-current financial assets. - debt instruments measured at FVOCI, with gains or losses being taken to the income statement upon derecognition. Financial assets classified in this category are listed debt instruments that meet the SPPI criterion and are held in a business model that provides for both the receipt of cash flows and the sale of the instruments. Under IAS 39, listed debt instruments were classified as available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets. The Employee Severance Indemnity (TFR), a mandatory requirement for Italian companies pursuant to Article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code, has the nature of deferred compensation and is related to the length of the working life of employees and the salary received during the period of service rendered. In application of IAS 19 (Employee benefits), the TFR so calculated is considered a “defined benefit plan” and the related obligation recognised in the financial statements (the Employee Severance Indemnity provision) is determined each year by an independent actuary using the “Projected Unit Credit Method”. The present value of the defined benefit plan is determined by discounting future cash flows at an interest rate equal to that of bonds issued in Euro which reflects the duration of the related pension plan. The service cost for the Group’s Italian companies with less than 50 employees, as well as interest expense relating to the time value component of actuarial calculations (the latter classified among finance expenses) are recognised in the consolidated income statement. With effect from 1 January 2007, Italian law allowed employees to choose whether to allocate their accruing severance indemnity to alternative external pension plans or elect for them to be retained by the employer. Companies with at least 50 employees are obliged to pay severance indemnity to the “Treasury Fund” managed by INPS. As a result, in accordance with IAS 19, the obligation towards INPS and the contributions to external pension plans assumed the nature of “defined contribution plans”. In the case of allocation to external pension plans, the company is only obliged to make defined contributions to such plans and, accordingly, from the aforementioned date, the related new TFR flows are deemed to be payments to a defined contribution plan not subject to actuarial valuation. With regard to the classification of costs relating to employee severance indemnities, costs for services rendered by employees are accounted for in “Personnel expenses”, interest costs are included within “Finance expenses” and actuarial gains/losses are recognised among other items of comprehensive income. expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. Advances paid by clients are deducted from inventories to the extent of the amounts accrued; any excess is recognised as a liability. Changes to the contract, price revisions and incentives are recognised to the extent that they have been agreed with the client. Costs are recognised on an accrual basis and are directly related to the provision of services. Costs incurred in relation to the acquisition of new knowledge or discoveries, the study of alternative products or processes, new techniques or models, the design and construction of prototypes or, in any case, costs incurred for other scientific research or technological development activities are generally considered current costs and are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Interest is recognised at the effective interest rate on an accrual basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities and are offset at the individual company level if they relate to taxes that can be offset. The offsetting balance, if positive, is recorded under “Deferred tax assets”; if negative, under “Deferred tax liabilities”. When the results of transactions are recognised directly in equity, current taxes, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are also recognised in equity. _Business combinations achieved in stages_ When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquired entity is measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. The previously held equity interest is then treated as if it were sold and reacquired at the date control is obtained. _Transactions involving non-controlling interests_ Changes in the ownership interest of a subsidiary that do not constitute a loss of control are treated as equity transactions. Accordingly, for acquisitions subsequent to gaining control, any positive or negative difference between the acquisition cost and the corresponding share of book equity is recognised directly in the Group’s equity; in the case of partial disposals of subsidiaries without loss of control, any gain is recognised directly in the Group’s equity. In the event that partial sales of subsidiaries result in the loss of control, the investment retained is adjusted to its fair value and the revaluation is included in the formation of the gain (loss) arising from the transaction.

IFRS 9 requires that the Group record expected credit losses (ECLs) in relation to all loans and other receivables representing financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Expected credit losses are defined as the difference between all the contractual cash flows that are due to an entity and the cash flows that it actually expects to receive. This difference is discounted at the original effective interest rate of the asset. For contract assets, trade receivables and other receivables, the Group adopts the simplified approach and calculates the ECL based on expected losses over the entire life of the receivable (the lifetime ECL). For other financial assets, ECL is based on 12-month expected credit losses, calculated based on the probability of a default occurring on the instrument in the 12 months following the reporting date. In any case, when there is a significant increase in credit risk following initial recognition of the receivable, the provision is made based on lifetime expected credit losses.

At 31 December 2020, goodwill amounted to Euro 6,140,310. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at the end of each financial year. The recoverable amount of CGUs was determined applying the value in use method and considering the estimated future cash flows of the individual CGUs. For impairment test purposes, the individual Group companies were considered to be separate CGUs except for certain specific cases that required different considerations. Operating cash flow forecasts were based on the 2021 budget and the strategic plans prepared for the period 2022-2026. Value in use was determined by applying the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, discounting operating cash flows based on four-year forecasts for the CGUs representing the subsidiaries, and six-year forecasts for BIP S.p.A. and the entire group, as it was deemed appropriate to consider such time horizon for consistency with the plans submitted to obtain new financing in the previous year. Specifically, for impairment test purposes, management updated the Business Plan to reflect the latest expectations in terms of the general economic performance in those countries in which it operates and the sector to which the Group belongs, as well as development expectations regarding activities already implemented in the previous financial year and those to be implemented in the near future. Management assessed the consistency of the cash flows envisaged in the plan with the financial requirements determined by the existing debt structure without identifying any critical issues. In performing the impairment test in relation to the goodwill described above, management based their calculations on the following assumptions: — results for financial year 2021 were estimated taking into account undelivered order trends in the early months of the year (as at the date of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements) and order forecasts for the coming months; — for subsequent years, forecast revenue growth (CAGR) was estimated at approximately 10% for the Group; F-55 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

It is noted that the terminal value was calculated by extrapolating the cash flows, as reported above, at a WACC specific for each CGU. The average WACC calculated for the Group was 8.8%.

The year on year increase mainly related to the recognition of deferred tax assets amounting to Euro 37,576,926 following the decision of the parent company BIP S.p.A. to opt for the tax realignment option permitted by Law 126/2020 in relation to goodwill, the BIP brand and the BIP client relationship, which generated a temporary difference (between the statutory financial statement balance and the related tax equivalent) in respect of the value of goodwill. The amount was calculated based on the value of goodwill, amounting to Euro 134,684,324 considering the IRES and IRAP tax rates in force. See Note 36 below for further details regarding such transaction. Based on detailed analysis and having reviewed the business plans of the various subsidiaries, Group management believes it will be possible to recover the deferred tax assets recognised in the financial statements at 31 December 2020 in future years.

If average interest rates had been one percentage point higher in 2020, the finance expenses charged to the income statement would have been approximately Euro 1,151,222 higher, corresponding to 0.40% of Group revenues and 4.04% of Group operating income (EBIT). Following the stipulation of the aforementioned IRS agreements, management deemed the risk associated with interest rate variability to be sustainable and capable of being absorbed by the company’s operations.

Pursuant to Law No. 296 of 27 December 2006 and subsequent decrees and regulations issued in the early months of 2007, with effect from 1 January 2007, the Employee Severance Indemnity (TFR) was transformed from a “defined benefit plan” to a “defined contribution plan” with the result that the accounting treatment differs depending on whether the TFR was accrued before or after 31 December 2006. The severance indemnity accruing from 1 January 2007 is a “defined contribution plan”. The company makes periodic accrued severance indemnity contributions to a separate entity (e.g. INPS and/or external funds) and in so doing fulfils its obligation towards its employees. The accounting treatment is similar to contributions of any other nature and therefore the severance indemnity accrued is recorded as a cost in the period and the related payable recorded among short-term payables. The employee severance indemnity accrued until 31 December 2006 is a “defined benefit plan”, the existence and amount of which is known but the timing of which is uncertain. The liability is determined as the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date, in accordance with applicable Italian law, adjusted for actuarial gains/losses. The amount of the defined benefit obligation is calculated and certified each year by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. The main financial assumptions adopted in the actuarial calculations made to determine the employee severance indemnity are summarized below: _Annual inflation rate: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ 0.80% _Annual rate of wage/salary growth: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ Executives . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.60% Managers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.70% Employees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . l,40% Annual rate of growth in employee severance indemnity (TFR): . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ 2.100% Annual discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ 0.34% F-69 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

The employee severance indemnity provision, governed by article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code, includes the estimated obligation, determined based on actuarial techniques, related to the amount to be paid to employees of Italian companies upon termination of employment. The indemnity, which is paid in the form of a lump sum, is equal to the sum of the provisions calculated on remuneration paid in relation to the employment relationship, revalued up to the time of termination of the same. As a result of legislative changes introduced as of 1 January 2007, the accrued severance pay is allocated to pension funds, to the treasury fund managed by INPS or, in the case of companies with fewer than 50 employees, may remain with the company. This implies that a significant portion of the accrued termination benefits is classified as a defined contribution plan as the company’s obligation is represented exclusively by the payment of contributions to the pension fund or to INPS. The liability relating to the employee severance indemnity prior to 1 January 2007 continues to represent a defined benefit plan subject to actuarial valuation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

As described in detail above, on 11 December 2019 the parent company BIP S.p.A. entered into a Facility Agreement granted by a pool of banks for a total of Euro 90,000,000. On 30 June 2020, in the context of the Chaucer Group acquisition, BIP, as provided for in the Facility Agreement, in agreement with the banking syndicate signed an Amendment and Restatement Agreement to obtain funds in the amount of Euro 23,477,823 and GBP 23,680,515 to finance the acquisition. See Note 14 above for further details. It is noted that in order to hedge future cash flows relating to the payment of interest on the loans described above, BIP S.p.A. entered into several Interest Rate Swap (IRS) contracts during the year at the following conditions: — With regard to the amortising loan for an original amount of Euro 26,000,000, interest at a fixed rate of 0.06% on an amount equal to 70% of the loan amount for the period until 11 December 2025 — With regard to the Bullet loan for an original amount of Euro 39,000,000, interest at a fixed rate of 0.20% on an amount equal to 70% of the loan amount for the period until 11 December 2026 — With regard to the amortising loan for an original amount of Euro 7,238,912, interest at a fixed rate of -0.19% on an amount equal to 70% of the loan amount for the period until 30 June 2026 — With regard to the amortising loan for an original amount of GBP 11,840,258, interest at a fixed rate of 0.296% for the derivatives granted by BNL and Credit Agricole and 0.280% on the derivative granted by UBI on an amount equal to 100% of the loan amount for the period until 30 June 2026 — With regard to the bullet loan for an original amount of GBP 11,840,258, interest at a fixed rate of 0.366% for the derivatives granted by BNL and Credit Agricole and 0.350% on the derivative granted by UBI on an amount equal to 100% of the loan amount for the period until 30 June 2027 — With regard to the bullet loan for an original amount of Euro 7,238,912, interest at a fixed rate of -0.13% on an amount equal to 70% of the loan amount for the period until 30 June 2027 The interest rate swap agreements were entered into for hedging purposes, as their maturities and payment amounts coincide with the instalments of the existing loans, and therefore the changes in fair value as at 31 December 2020 (a negative amount of Euro 1,600,321) were classified as “non-current financial liabilities” with a balancing entry, net of tax, in an equity reserve. With regard to the spread applied to the bullet and amortising loans, BIP S.p.A. monitors the Net Financial Debt/ EBITDA ratio on a monthly basis to determine in advance the interest rate applied and the related interest cost. At 31 December 2020, the contractual covenant was complied with and was equal to 1.34. Initial forecasts regarding the results for the first half of 2021 show that the Net Financial Debt/EBITDA ratio is less than 2.50, thereby ensuring interest equal to the six-month Euribor plus a spread of: — 1.85% for the Bullet Loan in the original amount of Euro 39,000,000 — 1.60% for the amortising loan in the original amount of Euro 26,000,000 — 1.50 % for the Revolving Loan in the original amount of Euro 25,000,000 — 2.45% for the amortising loan in the original amount of GBP 11,840,258 — 2.80% for the Bullet Financing in the original amount of GBP 11,840,258 — 2.10% for the amortising loan in the original amount of Euro 7,238,912 F-76 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore: - we identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; we design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks; we obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; F-88 ----- - we obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group internal control; - we evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management; - we conclude on the appropriateness of management use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern; - we evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; - we obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

On the acquisition date when control is obtained, the equity of subsidiaries is determined by valuing individual assets and liabilities at their fair value. If the total is less than the purchase consideration, the difference is recognized in the balance sheet as “Goodwill” (hereinafter goodwill); if the total is greater than the purchase consideration, the difference is recognized in the income statement. The shares of net equity and profit for the year attributable to non-controlling interests are recognized separately within equity and in the income statement. In the event full control is not assumed, the share of equity attributable to non-controlling interests is determined based on the share of the fair value attributed to the assets and liabilities on the acquisition date when control is obtained, less any goodwill relating to them (so-called partial goodwill method). In the case in which additional shares are acquired subsequent to assuming control (acquisition of minority interests) any excess of the purchase consideration over the corresponding portion of equity acquired is recognized in equity; in the same way, the effects of the sale of minority shareholdings without loss of control are recognized in equity. All Group company financial statements have been prepared as at the same reporting date, 31 December 2019.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) As at and for the year ended 31 December 2019 3. Measurement criteria (continued),216.416.2,,"Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: a) the financial asset is held within a business model, the objective of which is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met: - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets other than those measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of listed financial instruments is based on the quoted market price. If the market in question is not active (or the securities are not listed) Group companies determine fair value applying measurement techniques. Investments in equity instruments that do not have quoted prices in active markets and whose fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of individual assets, Considering the homogeneous nature of the assets included within the categories of intangible assets, the estimated useful lives of the various asset categories, subject to specific exceptions, is as follows: Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually and in any event whenever events indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The impairment test is carried out at the level of the smallest unit on the basis of which management directly or indirectly assesses the return on the investment that includes the goodwill itself. If the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is greater than the recoverable amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not subsequently reversed. The recoverable amount of a CGU (or group of CGUs) is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. An asset’s value in use is the present value of its estimated future cash flows calculated using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Future cash flows refer to those expected over a five-year time horizon, as well as those extrapolated from the final year of such time horizon for the purpose of estimating the terminal value. The long-term growth rate used to estimate the terminal value of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) is assumed to be no higher than the average long-term growth rate for the market sector in which the cash-generating unit (or group of units) operates. Future cash flows are estimated with reference to the current conditions of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) and, therefore, neither the benefits resulting from future restructuring to which the entity is not yet committed nor future investments to improve or optimise the unit are considered. For the purpose of impairment testing, the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit is determined in accordance with the method used to determine the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, excluding surplus assets (i.e. financial assets, deferred tax assets and net non-current assets held for sale) and including the portion of goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests. b) the right to a share of the reserves representing retained earnings from the financial year 2018, to the extent that the ordinary shareholders’ meeting approves such distribution during the company’s lifetime; c) the right to a share in the distribution of the remaining liquidation assets, following dissolution of the company, after payment of all of the Company’s creditors. The amount paid by subscribers is classified within financial liabilities (long-term or short-term depending on the maturity of the instrument) while the amount paid annually on such participative financial instruments is recognized in the income statement as “finance expenses” and until payment is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position as “other payables”. In accordance with IFRS 9, debt instruments are subsequently recognised at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), at amortised cost, or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The classification is based on two criteria: - the Group’s business model for managing the assets; - whether the cash flow of the contractual instruments represents “solely the payment of principal and interest” with respect to the outstanding principal (the ‘SPPI’ criterion). The new classification and measurement of debt instruments are as follows: - Debt instruments at amortised cost for financial assets that are held in a business model that has the objective of holding the financial assets to collect cash flows that meet the SPPI criterion. This category includes Trade and other Group receivables, as well as Loans classified as Other non-current financial assets. - debt instruments measured at FVOCI, with gains or losses being taken to the income statement upon derecognition. Financial assets classified in this category are listed debt instruments that meet the SPPI criterion and are held in a business model that provides for both the receipt of cash flows and the sale of the instruments. Under IAS 39, listed debt instruments were classified as available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets. Post-employment benefits are defined on the basis of plans, even if not formalised, which depending upon their characteristics are split into “defined contribution” and “defined benefit” plans. In the case of definedcontribution plans, the company’s obligation, limited to the payment of contributions to the State or to a legally separate entity (a fund), is determined on the basis of the contributions due. The liability relating to defined benefit plans, net of any plan assets, is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and is recognised on an accrual basis over the period of service necessary to obtain the benefits. Changes in actuarial gains/losses (‘remeasurements’) are recognised in other comprehensive income. Long-term employee benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial assumptions; the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions or changes in benefit characteristics are recognised in full in profit or loss. The Employee Severance Indemnity (TFR), a mandatory requirement for Italian companies pursuant to Article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code, has the nature of deferred compensation and is related to the length of the working life of employees and the salary received during the period of service rendered. In application of IAS 19 (Employee benefits), the TFR so calculated is considered a “defined benefit plan” and the related obligation recognised in the financial statements (the Employee Severance Indemnity provision) is determined each year by an independent actuary using the “Projected Unit Credit Method”. The present value of the defined benefit plan is determined by discounting future cash flows at an interest rate equal to that of bonds issued in Euro which reflects the duration of the related pension plan. The service cost for the Group’s Italian companies with less than 50 employees, as well as interest expense relating to the time value component of actuarial calculations (the latter classified among finance expenses) are recognised in the consolidated income statement. With effect from 1 January 2007, Italian law allowed employees to choose whether to allocate their accruing severance indemnity to alternative external pension plans or elect for them to be retained by the employer. Companies with at least 50 employees are obliged to pay severance indemnity to the “Treasury Fund” managed by INPS. As a result, in accordance with IAS 19, the obligation towards INPS and the contributions to external pension plans assumed the nature of “defined contribution plans”. In the case of allocation to external pension plans, the company is only obliged to make defined contributions to such plans and, accordingly, from the aforementioned date, the related new TFR flows are deemed to be payments to a defined contribution plan not subject to actuarial valuation. With regard to the classification of costs relating to employee severance indemnities, costs for services rendered by employees are accounted for in “Personnel expenses”, interest costs are included within “Finance expenses” and actuarial gains/losses are recognised among other items of comprehensive income. Revenues are reported net of returns, discounts, allowances and bonuses, as well as directly related taxes. In the case of work in progress when the outcome of a specific contract can be estimated reliably, the company’s performance does not create an asset of alternative use to the company and it has the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Revenue and expenses attributable to the related contract are recognised as revenue and expenses respectively in relation to the stage of completion of the activity at the reporting date, based on the ratio of costs incurred for work performed to date to the estimated total contract costs, unless this is not considered representative of the stage of completion of the contract. When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are expected to be recovered. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. Advances paid by clients are deducted from inventories to the extent of the amounts accrued; any excess is recognised as a liability. Changes to the contract, price revisions and incentives are recognised to the extent that they have been agreed with the client. Costs are recognised on an accrual basis and are directly related to the provision of services. Costs incurred in relation to the acquisition of new knowledge or discoveries, the study of alternative products or processes, new techniques or models, the design and construction of prototypes or, in any case, costs incurred for other scientific research or technological development activities are generally considered current costs and are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Interest is recognised at the effective interest rate on an accrual basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding amounts recognised for tax purposes based on tax rates and regulations approved or substantially approved for future periods. Deferred tax assets are recognised when their recovery is considered probable. With regard to temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, the related deferred tax liability is not recognised if the investor is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that it will not occur in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities and are offset at the individual company level if they relate to taxes that can be offset. The offsetting balance, if positive, is recorded under “Deferred tax assets”; if negative, under “Deferred tax liabilities”. When the results of transactions are recognised directly in equity, current taxes, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are also recognised in equity. previously held equity interest, if any, in the acquiree, such excess is recognised immediately in other comprehensive income as income resulting from the completed transaction. The equity attributable to non-controlling interests at the acquisition date may be measured either at fair value or in proportion to the non-controlling interests’ interest in the acquiree’s identifiable assets. The choice of valuation method is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. _Business combinations achieved in stages_ When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquired entity is measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. The previously held equity interest is then treated as if it were sold and reacquired at the date control is obtained. _Transactions involving non-controlling interests_ Changes in the ownership interest of a subsidiary that do not constitute a loss of control are treated as equity transactions. Accordingly, for acquisitions subsequent to gaining control, any positive or negative difference between the acquisition cost and the corresponding share of book equity is recognised directly in the Group’s equity; in the case of partial disposals of subsidiaries without loss of control, any gain is recognised directly in the Group’s equity. In the event that partial sales of subsidiaries result in the loss of control, the investment retained is adjusted to its fair value and the revaluation is included in the formation of the gain (loss) arising from the transaction. The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of goodwill for an amount of €918,636 in the consolidated financial statements, due to the expected synergies of the activities of the acquired and acquiring parties.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Real estate held for the primary or exclusive purpose of earning rental income or for capital appreciation or both (“Investment Property”) is not included in this asset category. Items of property, plant and equipment are recognised at purchase price, which is represented by the fair value of the price paid to acquire the asset and any other direct cost incurred to prepare the asset for use. Costs related to the expansion, modernisation or improvement of owned or leased assets are capitalised to the extent that they meet the requirements to be classified as an asset or part of an asset.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life of individual assets, which is the estimated period over which the asset will be used by the Group. This period starts from when the asset is available for use. When the asset includes several significant components with different useful lives, each component is depreciated separately.

Said interpretation clarifies how to apply the requirements relevant to recognition and measurement under IAS 12, in case of uncertainty over income tax treatments. In this case, the entity should recognize and measure its tax assets or liabilities, either current or deferred, by applying the requirements as per IAS 12, based on the taxable income (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates determined by applying this Interpretation. An entity is required to use judgment to determine whether each tax treatment should be considered independently or whether one or more uncertain tax treatments should be considered together. In assessing an uncertain tax treatment, an entity shall assume that tax authorities, during tax assessments, will examine those amounts and will have full knowledge of all relevant information when doing so. An entity has to consider whether it is probable that the relevant authority will accept uncertain tax treatments. If the entity concludes that it is probable that the uncertain tax treatment is accepted, the entity has to determine taxable income (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatment applied or included in its income tax filings. If the entity concludes that it is not probable that the uncertain tax treatment is accepted, the entity has to report the effect of uncertainty for each tax treatment by using either of the two following F-110 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Goodwill is not amortized but it is tested for impairment on an annual basis as at the reporting date. As regards the recoverable value of the only CGU, based on the method of value in use, measurement was based on estimates on cash flows generated by each CGUs. In order to carry out the impairment, each company of the Group has been considered as CGU, except in some specific cases that required a different approach. Expected operating cash flows were taken from the 2020 budget and the strategic plans for the 2020-2023 period. The value in use has been determined with the “discounted cash flow” method, discounting operating cash flows based on four-year forecasts for the CGUs representing the subsidiaries, and seven-year forecasts for BIP S.p.A. and the entire group. This was due to the fact that this timing was considered consistent with the plans submitted to obtain new loans at more favourable conditions in place of the existing ones, as per note 14. Specifically, for impairment test purposes, management updated the Business Plan to reflect the latest expectations in terms of the general economic performance in those countries in which it operates and the sector to which the Group belongs, as well as development expectations regarding activities already implemented in the previous financial year and those F-114 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Management assessed the consistency of the cash flows envisaged in the plan with the financial requirements determined by the existing debt structure without identifying any critical issues. The only impairment identified was the CGU related to the subsidiary BIP Turkey for which, taking into consideration the economic, political and currency-related context of the country, an impairment of €500,000 was recorded. In performing the impairment test in relation to the goodwill described above, management based their calculations on the following assumptions: — results for financial year 2020 were estimated taking into account undelivered order trends in the early months of the year (as at the date of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements) and order forecasts for the coming months; — for subsequent years, forecast revenue growth (CAGR) was estimated at approximately 8%; — group profitability (operating result/revenues) was conservatively expected to remain constant over the years of the plan; — average collection and payment timelines were estimated to be in line with historical data; — growth in perpetuity for the period after the timeframe of the plan was conservatively estimated for each CGU at a group-wide rate of 1.5%. It is noted that the terminal value was calculated by extrapolating the cash flows, as reported above, at a WACC specific for each CGU. The average WACC calculated for the Group was 9.4%. Sensitivity analyses carried out varying the discount rate also confirmed that the value of goodwill is fully maintained.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) As at and for the year ended 31 December 2019 14. Non-current financial liabilities (continued),341.76.1,,"The item is broken down as follows and has undergone the following changes during the year: — any pledges relating to the shares of companies falling within the definition of Material Subsidiaries, pursuant to the Bond Regulations, and belonging to the BIP group (at present, based on the contractual conditions, no Group company falls within the definition of “Material Subsidiaries”). — The entire loan is subject to compliance with the Net Financial Debt/EBITDA financial covenant to be measured every six months, which is set at 3.0 until 30 June 2021 and at 2.5 for the remaining semi-annual reference dates. The 2020-2026 Business Plan confirmed BIP’s capacity of fully reimbursing the interest on a quarterly basis, in addition to the principal on 11 December 2026. As at 31 December 2019, the contractual covenant was fulfilled and amounted to 1.93. The results of the first quarter 2019 also highlight that the ratio of net financial position and operating results is lower than 2.25, thus guaranteeing, for the months after 31 March 2019, an interest rate of 4.25% and a margin of 4.25% above the quarterly EURIBOR. The loans were recorded at amortised cost in compliance with IAS 39. The debt issuance costs, equal to €1,155,644, are considered in future cash flows to determine the effective interest rate. The calculation led to recording the financial payables related to bond loans for an amount of €63,844,356 as at 31 December 2019. It should be noted that the previous bond loan was also recorded in the 2018 financial statements at amortised cost. Following the early repayment in December 2019, the remaining portion of the unamortized costs, for an amount of €3,509,348, was released to the statement of comprehensive income and recorded as finance expense. It is worth noting that, in order to hedge future interest rate cash flows, in 2018 BIP S.p.A. entered into an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) contract with a fixed rate of 0.11% for an amount of €50 million, for a duration up to 31 July 2020. As at 31 December 2019, it is still in force and, even though this IRS was entered into by the management for hedging purposes, it not compliant with the hedging terms set out by IAS 32 and was therefore considered as speculative. Changes in fair value were entered in the Income Statements, under item “interest”. If average rates had been one percentage point higher in 2019, the financial charges charged to the income statement would have been about €650,000 higher, equal to 0.27% of Group revenues and 2.32% of Group operating income (EBIT). Management, also after the stipulation of the above- mentioned IRS, has considered the risk profile relating to the variability of rates to be sustainable and absorbable by the operational management of the Company.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) As at and for the year ended 31 December 2019 19. Employee benefits (continued),341.95.1,,"Employee benefits amounted to €1,992,811 and related to the severance indemnity (TFR) for Group companies with registered offices in Italy. Pursuant to Law No. 296 of 27 December 2006 and subsequent decrees and regulations issued in the early months of 2007, with effect from 1 January 2007, the Employee Severance Indemnity (TFR) was transformed from a “defined benefit plan” to a “defined contribution plan” with the result that the accounting treatment differs depending on whether the TFR was accrued before or after 31 December 2006. The severance indemnity accruing from 1 January 2007 is a “defined contribution plan”. The company makes periodic accrued severance indemnity contributions to a separate entity (e.g. INPS and/or external funds) and in so doing fulfils its obligation towards its employees. The accounting treatment is similar to contributions of any other nature and therefore the severance indemnity accrued is recorded as a cost in the period and the related payable recorded among short-term payables. The employee severance indemnity accrued until 31 December 2006 is a “defined benefit plan”, the existence and amount of which is known but the timing of which is uncertain. The liability is determined as the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date, in accordance with applicable Italian law, adjusted for actuarial gains/losses. The amount of the defined benefit obligation is calculated and certified each year by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. The main financial assumptions adopted in the actuarial calculations made to determine the employee severance indemnity are summarized below: Annual inflation rate: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ 1.50% _Annual rate of wage/salary growth: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ Executives: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.60% Managers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.70% Employees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.40% Annual rate of growth in employee severance indemnity (TFR): . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ 2.625% Annual discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ 0.70% In accordance with Paragraph 83 of IAS 19, the annual discount rate used to calculate the present value of the obligation was based on the Iboxx Corporate AA index with duration 10+ as at the valuation date. Accordingly, the term of the corporate bond yield selected was consistent with the term of the post-employment benefit obligations. The annual rate of increase of the TFR is 75% of inflation plus 1.5 percentage points. As for the technical demographic bases: Death: RG48 mortality tables published by the General State Accounting Body Disability: INPS tables by age and gender Retirement: 100% on achieving AGO requirements The item is broken down as follows. The employee severance indemnity provision, governed by article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code, includes the estimated obligation, determined based on actuarial techniques, related to the amount to be paid to employees of Italian companies upon termination of employment. The indemnity, which is paid in the form of a lump sum, is equal to the sum of the provisions calculated on remuneration paid in relation to the employment relationship, revalued up to the time of termination of the same. As a result of legislative changes introduced as of 1 January 2007, the accrued severance pay is allocated to pension funds, to the treasury fund managed by INPS or, in the case of companies with fewer than 50 employees, may remain with the company. This implies that a significant portion of the accrued termination benefits is classified as a defined contribution plan as the company’s obligation is represented exclusively by the payment of contributions to the pension fund or to INPS. The liability relating to the employee severance indemnity prior to 1 January 2007 continues to represent a defined benefit plan subject to actuarial valuation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Significant events occurring after the reporting period,342.59.1,,"On 10 January 2020, BIP S.p.A. acquired further 10% of the share capital of SketchinS.a.g.l., thus increasing its control to 65%. On 20 February 2020, the parent company BIP S.p.A. acquired 100% of Vidiemme Consulting S.r.l., a company with registered office in Milan, providing services in the fields of informatics, company elaboration, studies and programming along with projects on digital innovation focused on web, mobile technology, wearable devices and new technologies. As part of the payment of the price, it was agreed with the sellers that a first portion of the price of €2,000,000 was paid on the date of completion of the acquisition, while a second instalment will be determined at end of 2019 on the basis of the results achieved. An earn-out mechanism is also envisaged, based on the achievement of determined EBITDA targets, with reference to financial years 2020, 2021 and 2022. In March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic – caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Coronavirus) - spread in Italy and across Europe. The pandemic had and still has negative effects on International trade, due to different factors, including the lockdown measures imposed by the governments of the affected countries. The Management has immediately committed itself to handle the emergency in the entire Group through the reorganization of activities via smart working, continuous contact with customers and order monitoring, as well as cost containment activities. Moreover, analyses were made on the possible economic and financial performance of BIP and the Group. The business performance, the 2020 budget for BIP SpA and the Group expected a growth in revenues and margins of about 12%, and the results of the first three months of the year 2020 confirmed the budget trend. However, in light of the negative economic effects of the spread of the virus and in order to evaluate, with particular attention, the evolution of EBITDA, NFP and the current banking covenants (NFP/EBITDA), the Directors developed some preliminary sensitivity analyses on the economic and financial budget, assuming different scenarios with possible moderately negative or more significant economic and financial impacts. These assumptions, by their very nature, contain elements of uncertainty and are subject to changes, even significant ones, due to the continuous changes in the scenario and the reference context that could lead to an alteration, even significant, of normal market dynamics.

Significant non-recurring events and transactions,342.61.4,Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements,"Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore: - we identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; we design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks; we obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; F-143 ----- - we obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group internal control; - we evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management; - we conclude on the appropriateness of management use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern; - we evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; - we obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

The Group has currently completed the analysis of contracts that are possibly affected by this standard, referred primarily to lease contracts of real estates for office use at the various headquarters of the company, and longterm lease contracts for company cars. The transition method that will be adopted consists in the above-mentioned modified retrospective. In particular, as regards lease contracts previously classified as operating leases, the Company will account for the following: - a financial liability, equal to the current value of residual future payments at the transition date, discounted by using, for each single contract, the incremental borrowing rate, applicable at the transition date; - the right of use, equal to the value of the financial liability, at the transition date, net of possible accruals and deferrals referred to the lease and recognized in the Balance Sheet at the reporting date of these financial statements; In applying the accounting method of leases, the Management carefully valued the definition of the lease term, by identifying the non-cancellable period and supplementing it to take account of any possible options that are reasonably likely to be exercised. In light of the analysis performed, the estimate of the effects of the application of IFRS 16, as at 1 January 2019, involves the following: - Financial liabilities equal to €18,168,120. The discounting of future cash flows was performed with 1% rate. - a right of use equal to the financial liability amounting to €18,168,120.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements As at and for the year ended 31 December 2018 1. General Information,349.8.1,,"On 27 March 2018, the Apax Partners France Fund (Apax) acquired the control of BIP S.p.A. The transaction was carried out through: - the incorporation of the SPV BEEP S.p.A. (“BEEP”), which took over from the previous shareholders,—i.e. the Argos Soditic Fund and the equity partners of the Company—the entire shareholding of BIP (through direct acquisition of BIP shares and total acquisition of the shares of the holding companies Trepuntozero S.r.l. and Manbeep S.A.) - the simultaneous reinvestment of BIP’s equity partners in shares of RacBip Srl and RunBip Srl. To finance this transaction, on 27 March 2018 BEEP issued two non-convertible bonds with a principal amount of €60,000,000 and €5,000,000, entered into by the investment and asset management company Tikehau Capital. Subsequently, with the aim of streamlining the business control chain, with improvement both in terms of management flexibility and reduction of overall costs relating to the business structure, on 24 December 2018, the merger by incorporation of BEEP, Trepuntozero Srl and ManBeep Srl in BIP S.p.A. was carried out.

On initial recognition, financial assets are measured at cost, which corresponds to fair value plus transaction costs relating to the acquisition. Subsequent measurement depends upon the nature of the instrument. Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: a) the financial asset is held within a business model, the objective of which is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) As at and for the year ended 31 December 2018 3. Measurement criteria (continued),349.23.2,,"- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets other than those measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of listed financial instruments is based on the quoted market price. If the market in question is not active (or the securities are not listed) Group companies determine fair value applying measurement techniques. Investments in equity instruments that do not have quoted prices in active markets and whose fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost. Considering the homogeneous nature of the assets included within the categories of property, plant and equipment, the estimated useful lives of the various asset categories, subject to specific exceptions, is as follows: The amortisation criteria used, the useful lives and the residual values are reviewed and redefined at least at the end of each financial period in order to take account of any significant changes. The book value of individual intangible assets is maintained in the financial statements to the extent that there is evidence that such value can be recovered through use. If evidence suggests there may be difficulties in recovering the net book value, an impairment test is carried out. Costs associated with the purchase for use of patents and licenses are capitalized as intangible assets. The cost is represented by the fair value of the price paid to acquire the right and any direct costs incurred to adapt and implement it in the entity’s operating and production environment. The amortization period cannot exceed the shorter of the useful life and the duration of the legal or contractual right. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any difference between the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell is recognised as an impairment loss in the income statement; any subsequent reversals are recognised up to the amount of the previously recognised impairment losses, including those recognised before the asset was classified as held for sale. Post-employment benefits are defined on the basis of plans, even if not formalised, which depending upon their characteristics are split into “defined contribution” and “defined benefit” plans. In the case of definedcontribution plans, the company’s obligation, limited to the payment of contributions to the State or to a legally separate entity (a fund), is determined on the basis of the contributions due. The liability relating to defined benefit plans, net of any plan assets, is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and is recognised on an accrual basis over the period of service necessary to obtain the benefits. Changes in actuarial gains/losses (‘remeasurements’) are recognised in other comprehensive income. Long-term employee benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial assumptions; the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions or changes in benefit characteristics are recognised in full in profit or loss. The Employee Severance Indemnity (TFR), a mandatory requirement for Italian companies pursuant to Article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code, has the nature of deferred compensation and is related to the length of the working life of employees and the salary received during the period of service rendered. In application of IAS 19 (Employee benefits), the TFR so calculated is considered a “defined benefit plan” and the related obligation recognised in the financial statements (the Employee Severance Indemnity provision) is determined each year by an independent actuary using the “Projected Unit Credit Method”. The present value of the defined benefit plan is determined by discounting future cash flows at an interest rate equal to that of bonds issued in Euro which reflects the duration of the related pension plan. The service cost for the Group’s Italian companies with less than 50 employees, as well as interest expense relating to the time value component of actuarial calculations (the latter classified among finance expenses) are recognised in the consolidated income statement. With effect from 1 January 2007, Italian law allowed employees to choose whether to allocate their accruing severance indemnity to alternative external pension plans or elect for them to be retained by the employer. Companies with at least 50 employees are obliged to pay severance indemnity to the “Treasury Fund” managed by INPS. As a result, in accordance with IAS 19, the obligation towards INPS and the contributions to external pension plans assumed the nature of “defined contribution plans”. In the case of allocation to external pension plans, the company is only obliged to make defined contributions to such plans and, accordingly, from the aforementioned date, the related new TFR flows are deemed to be payments to a defined contribution plan not subject to actuarial valuation. With regard to the classification of costs relating to employee severance indemnities, costs for services rendered by employees are accounted for in “Personnel expenses”, interest costs are included within “Finance expenses” and actuarial gains/losses are recognised among other items of comprehensive income. Revenues are reported net of returns, discounts, allowances and bonuses, as well as directly related taxes. In the case of work in progress when the outcome of a specific contract can be estimated reliably, the company’s performance does not create an asset of alternative use to the company and it has the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Revenue and expenses attributable to the related contract are recognised as revenue and expenses respectively in relation to the stage of completion of the activity at the reporting date, based on the ratio of costs incurred for work performed to date to the estimated total contract costs, unless this is not considered representative of the stage of completion of the contract. Changes to the contract, price revisions and incentives are recognised to the extent that they have been agreed with the client. Costs are recognised on an accrual basis and are directly related to the provision of services. Costs incurred in relation to the acquisition of new knowledge or discoveries, the study of alternative products or processes, new techniques or models, the design and construction of prototypes or, in any case, costs incurred for other scientific research or technological development activities are generally considered current costs and are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Interest is recognised at the effective interest rate on an accrual basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities and are offset at the individual company level if they relate to taxes that can be offset. The offsetting balance, if positive, is recorded under “Deferred tax assets”; if negative, under “Deferred tax liabilities”. When the results of transactions are recognised directly in equity, current taxes, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are also recognised in equity. _Business combinations achieved in stages_ When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquired entity is measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. The previously held equity interest is then treated as if it were sold and reacquired at the date control is obtained. _Transactions involving non-controlling interests_ Changes in the ownership interest of a subsidiary that do not constitute a loss of control are treated as equity transactions. Accordingly, for acquisitions subsequent to gaining control, any positive or negative difference between the acquisition cost and the corresponding share of book equity is recognised directly in the Group’s equity; in the case of partial disposals of subsidiaries without loss of control, any gain is recognised directly in the Group’s equity. In the event that partial sales of subsidiaries result in the loss of control, the investment retained is adjusted to its fair value and the revaluation is included in the formation of the gain (loss) arising from the transaction. As regards work in progress, when the outcome of an order can be reliably estimated, revenue and costs attributable to the order are recognized as revenue and costs, respectively, according to the progress the of works at the reporting date of the financial statements, based on the relation between costs incurred for the activity performed until the balance-sheet date and total costs estimated for the contractual work, unless this relation is not deemed as reflecting the work in progress of the order. Any changes in the agreement and prices, as well as incentives are included to the extent agreed upon with the customer. When the outcome of an agreement cannot be estimated reliably, revenue attributable to the related order are recognized only to the extent of order-related costs that are likely to be recovered. The costs deriving from the order are recognized as charges for the year n which they are incurred.

Goodwill arising at the acquisition date is allocated to each of the cash-generating units, or groups of cashgenerating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies generated by the business combination. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually and in any event whenever events indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The impairment test is carried out at the level of the smallest unit on the basis of which management directly or indirectly assesses the return on the investment that includes the goodwill itself. If the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is greater than the recoverable amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not subsequently reversed. The recoverable amount of a CGU (or group of CGUs) is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. An asset’s value in use is the present value of its estimated future cash flows calculated using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Future cash flows refer to those expected over a five-year time horizon, as well as those extrapolated from the final year of such time horizon for the purpose of estimating the terminal value. The long-term growth rate used to estimate the terminal value of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) is assumed to be no higher than the average long-term growth rate for the market sector in which the cash-generating unit (or group of units) operates. Future cash flows are estimated with reference to the current conditions of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) and, therefore, neither the benefits resulting from future restructuring to which the entity is not yet committed nor future investments to improve or optimise the unit are considered. For the purpose of impairment testing, the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit is determined in accordance with the method used to determine the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, excluding surplus assets (i.e. financial assets, deferred tax assets and net non-current assets held for sale) and including the portion of goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Pursuant to IFRS 9, financial debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value recognized in the income statement (FVPL), at amortised cost or at fair value recognized in other items of the comprehensive income statement (FVOCI). The classification is based on two criteria: - The Group’s business model for the activity management; - If the cash flow of contractual instruments “only represents the payment of capital and interest” compared to the capital in place (the “SPPI” criterion). The new classification and measurement of the financial instruments are as follows: - Debt instruments at amortised cost for financial assets that are held in a business model intended to hold financial assets to collect cash flows within the SPPI criterion. This category includes trade receivables and other receivables due to the Group, as well as loans classified under other non-current financial assets. - FVOCI debt instruments, with profits or losses recycled in the income statement upon derecognition. Financial assets classified under this category are listed debt instruments that comply with the SPPI criterion and are held in a business model that envisages both the collection of cash flows and the sale of instruments. In compliance with IAS 39, listed debt instruments were classified as Available-for-sale financial assets (AFS). The Other financial assets and subsequently measured as follows: - FVOCI equity-settled instruments, with profit or loss that are not recycled in the income statement upon derecognition. This category includes only equity instruments that are to be held for a foreseeable future and that are irrevocably classified as such upon initial recognition or transfer. In compliance with IFRS 9, FVOCI equity instruments are not tested for impairment. - FVPL financial assets include listed derivative instruments and listed equity instruments for which the irrevocable decision was not taken to classify them as FVOCI, upon initial recognition or transfer.

The IFRS 9 standard requires that the Company record an ECL allocation, in relation to all loans and other receivables representing a financial asset that is not held as FVPL. Expected credit losses (ECL) are based on the difference between contract-based cash flows due and all cash flows that are expected to be received. The negative difference is then discounted by using an approximation of the original effective interest rate of the asset. As regards contractual assets and other trade receivables, the Company elected to apply the standard simplified approach and calculated the ECL based on expected credit losses along the whole life of receivables. For other financial assets, ECL is based on 12 month-ECL. 12 month-ECL is part of ECLs envisaged for payables whole life, resulting from the default of financial instruments allowed for in the 12 month following the reporting date.

Goodwill is not amortized but it is tested for impairment on an annual basis as at the reporting date. As regards the recoverable value of the only CGU, based on the method of value in use, measurement was based on estimates on cash flows generated by the each CGUs. In order to carry out the impairment, each company of the Group has been considered as CGU. Expected operating cash flows were taken from the 2019 budget and the strategic plans for the 2018-2025 period. The value in use has been determined with the “discounted cash flow” method, discounting operating cash flows based on seven-year forecast. Specifically, for impairment test purposes, management updated the Business Plan to reflect the latest expectations in terms of the general economic performance in those countries in which it operates and the sector in which the Group belongs, as well as development expectations deriving regarding activities already implemented in the previous financial year and those to be implemented in the near future. Management assessed the consistency of the cash flows envisaged in the plan with the financial requirements determined by the debt structure, without identifying any critical issues. The only impairment identified was the CGU related to the subsidiary BIP Turkey, for which, taking into considerations the economic, political and currency-related context of the country, an impairment of €500,000 was deemed suited. In performing the impairment test in relation to the goodwill described above, management based their calculations on the following assumptions: - results for financial year 2019 were estimated taking into account undelivered order trends in the early months of the year (at the date of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements) and - orders forecast for the coming months; - for subsequent years 2019 – 2021, forecast revenues growth (CAGR) was estimated at approximately 8%; - group profitability (operating result) was expected to remain constant over the years of the plan; F-170 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Following the reverse merger, the two bond loans were included in the BIP S.p.A. financial statements. The 2018-2025 Business Plan confirmed BIP’s capacity of fully reimbursing the interest on a quarterly basis, in addition to the principal on 27 March 2025. As at 31 December 2018, the contractual covenant was fulfilled and amounted to 1.93. The results of the first quarter 2019 also highlight that the ratio of net financial position and operating results is lower than 2.25, thus guaranteeing, for the months after 31 March 2019, an interest rate of 4.25% and a margin of 4.25% above the quarterly EURIBOR. The accounting of the two loans was carried out in compliance with IAS 39, at amortised cost. The costs borne for their subscription, equal to €3,421,033, are considered in future cash flows to determine the effective interest rate. The calculation led to the valuation of the financial payables related to bond loans to a value of €61,490,650 as at 31 December 2018. It is worth noting that, in order to hedge future cash flows due to the payment of interest, BIP S.p.A. entered an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) contract with a fixed rate of 0.11% over an amount of €50 million, for a duration up to 31 July 2020. Even though this IRS was entered into by the management for hedging purposes, it not compliant with the hedging terms set out by IAS 32 and was therefore considered as speculative. Changes in fair value were entered in the Income Statements, under item “interest”. Each equity financial instrument grants the following rights: a) the right to a share of the profits for the financial year, to the extent that the ordinary shareholders’ meeting approves such distribution; b) the right to a share of the reserves representing retained earnings from the financial year 2018, to the extent that the ordinary shareholders’ meeting approves such distribution during the company’s lifetime; c) the right to a share in the distribution of the remaining liquidation assets, following dissolution of the company, after payment of all of the Company’s creditors. The amount paid by subscribers is classified within financial liabilities (long-term or short-term, depending on the duration of the instrument in accordance with IAS 32) and amounts to €2,142,000 as at 31 December 2018. The amount paid annually on such participative financial instruments is recognized in the income statement as “financial expenses” and until its payment is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position as “other payables”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,540

Pursuant to Law No. 296 of 27 December 2006 and subsequent decrees and regulations issued in the early months of 2007, with effect from 1 January 2007, the Employee Severance Indemnity (TFR) was transformed from a “defined benefit plan” to a “defined contribution plan” with the result that the accounting treatment differs depending on whether the TFR was accrued before or after 31 December 2006. The severance indemnity accruing from 1 January 2007 is a “defined contribution plan”. The company makes periodic accrued severance indemnity contributions to a separate entity (e.g. INPS and/or external funds) and in so doing fulfils its obligation towards its employees. The accounting treatment is similar to contributions of any F-181 ----- The employee severance indemnity provision, governed by article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code, includes the estimated obligation, determined based on actuarial techniques, related to the amount to be paid to employees of Italian companies upon termination of employment. The indemnity, which is paid in the form of a lump sum, is equal to the sum of the provisions calculated on remuneration paid in relation to the employment relationship, revalued up to the time of termination of the same. As a result of legislative changes introduced as of 1 January 2007, the accrued severance pay is allocated to pension funds, to the treasury fund managed by INPS or, in the case of companies with fewer than 50 employees, may remain with the company. This implies that a significant portion of the accrued termination benefits is classified as a defined contribution plan as the company’s obligation is represented exclusively by the payment of contributions to the pension fund or to INPS. The liability relating to the employee severance indemnity prior to 1 January 2007 continues to represent a defined benefit plan subject to actuarial valuation. F-182 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,540
