We are focused on operating smaller, high-margin_ brands. We have assembled a diverse portfolio of brands consisting primarily of niche or specialty products with strong market positions and high operating income margins.

For example, our Green _Giant and Le Sueur brands compete in a category well-positioned to benefit from the health and wellness trend, our Back to Nature products compete_ in the ""better-for-you"" snack category, and our Ortega, Las Palmas and Sa-són Ac'cent brands compete in the U.S. Mexican and Hispanic market category. We believe that our diverse product portfolio provides a strong platform to capture growth in the packaged food industry and to generate strong profitability and significant cash flows while mitigating the financial impact of competitive pressure or commodity cost increases in any single brand or product. _Well-developed and proven acquisition platform.

We have successfully completed acquisitions from sellers such as Treehouse Foods, ACH Food Companies, General Mills, Chipita America, Unilever, Kraft, Cadbury Schweppes, Nestlé, Pillsbury and Nabisco. Our acquisitions of the Back to Nature, Clabber _Girl, Tone's, Weber, Green Giant, Mama Mary's, Bear Creek Country Kitchens, Mrs. Dash, Cream of Wheat and Ortega brands are examples of our_ ability to acquire leading shelf-stable brands with high profitability from large packaged food companies and private investors. _Track record of new product introductions.  We have demonstrated the ability to develop new products and product extensions rapidly, and we_ have been able to deliver these new products to our customers quickly.

During fiscal 2018, we recognized a pretax gain on the Pirate Brands sale of $176.4 million. 7 Impairment of intangible assets for fiscal 2016 includes a $4.5 million loss for the impairment of amortizable trademarks and a $0.9 million loss for the impairment of customer relationship intangibles, both relating to Rickland Orchards. 8 Fiscal 2016 loss on extinguishment of debt includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs of $2.2 million and the writeoff of unamortized discount of $0.6 million in connection with the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. Fiscal 2017 loss on extinguishment of debt includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs of $0.9 million and the write-off of unamortized discount of $0.2 million in connection with the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the tranche A term loans and the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and the write-off of unamortized discount of less than $0.1 million in connection with the refinancing of our tranche B term loans.

Other income for fiscal 2017 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $1.6 million and includes the impact of the newly adopted presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs below operating profit in the amount of $1.5 million.

A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of our financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows. We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt (see footnote (10) above). We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for cash and non-cash acquisition/divestiture-related expenses, gains and losses (which may include third party fees and expenses, integration, restructuring and consolidation expenses, amortization of acquired inventory fair value step-up and gains and losses on the sale of assets); non-recurring expenses, gains and losses; gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of contingent liabilities from earn-outs; the non-cash accounting impact of our inventory reduction plan; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; loss on product recalls, including customer refunds, selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact on cost of sales; and distribution restructuring expenses. Management believes that it is useful to eliminate these items because it allows management to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, determine employee bonuses and evaluate our cash flows in terms of cash needs. We also present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe they are useful indicators of our historical debt capacity and ability to service debt and because covenants in our credit agreement and our senior notes indentures contain ratios based on these measures. As a result, reports used by internal management during monthly operating reviews feature the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA metrics. However, management uses these metrics in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance and liquidity measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance and liquidity, and therefore does not place undue reliance on these measures as its only measures of operating performance and liquidity. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income, net income or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete net cash flow measures because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are measures of liquidity that do not include reductions for cash payments for an entity's obligation to service its debt, fund its working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay its income taxes and dividends. Rather, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are two potential indicators of an entity's ability to fund these cash requirements. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete measures of an entity's profitability because they do not include certain costs and expenses and gains and losses described above. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA can still be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because management believes these measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP amounts.

Other income for fiscal 2017 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $1.6 million and includes the impact of the newly adopted presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs below operating profit in the amount of $1.5 million. Other income for fiscal 2018 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $1.2 million and includes the impact of the newly S-15 ----- adopted presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs below operating profit in the amount of $2.4 million. 10 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management to measure operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of our financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows. We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt (see footnote (10) above). We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for cash and non-cash acquisition/divestiture-related expenses, gains and losses (which may include third party fees and expenses, integration, restructuring and consolidation expenses, amortization of acquired inventory fair value step-up and gains and losses on the sale of assets); non-recurring expenses, gains and losses; gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of contingent liabilities from earn-outs; the non-cash accounting impact of our inventory reduction plan; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; loss on product recalls, including customer refunds, selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact on cost of sales; and distribution restructuring expenses. Management believes that it is useful to eliminate these items because it allows management to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, determine employee bonuses and evaluate our cash flows in terms of cash needs. We also present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe they are useful indicators of our historical debt capacity and ability to service debt and because covenants in our credit agreement and our senior notes indentures contain ratios based on these measures. As a result, reports used by internal management during monthly operating reviews feature the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA metrics. However, management uses these metrics in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance and liquidity measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance and liquidity, and therefore does not place undue reliance on these measures as its only measures of operating performance and liquidity. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income, net income or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete net cash flow measures because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are measures of liquidity that do not include reductions for cash payments for an entity's obligation to service its debt, fund its working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay its income taxes and dividends. Rather, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are two potential indicators of an entity's ability to fund these cash requirements. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete measures of an entity's profitability because they do not include certain costs and expenses and gains and losses described above. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA can still be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because management believes these measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP amounts.

As required, at June 28, 2014 we remeasured the fair value of the contingent consideration using actual operating results through June 28, 2014 and revised forecasted operating results for the remainder of fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, and reduced the probability of achievement and the fair value of the contingent consideration to zero. This resulted in a non-cash gain of $8.2 million that is included in gain on change in fair value of contingent consideration in fiscal 2014. S-35 ----- 10 Fiscal 2014 loss on extinguishment of debt includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs of $5.4 million and the write-off of unamortized discount of $0.3 million in connection with the termination of our prior credit agreement and the repayment of all outstanding obligations thereunder. Fiscal 2016 loss on extinguishment of debt includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs of $2.2 million and the write-off of unamortized discount of $0.6 million in connection with the repayment of $40.1 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche A term loans and $109.9 million aggregate principal amount of our tranche B term loans. Fiscal 2017 loss on extinguishment of debt includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs of $0.9 million and the write-off of unamortized discount of $0.2 million in connection with the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the tranche A term loans and the writeoff of deferred debt financing costs and the write-off of unamortized discount of less than $0.1 million in connection with the refinancing of our tranche B term loans. Fiscal 2018 loss on extinguishment of debt includes the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $11.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, relating to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the tranche B term loans. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the first two quarters of 2018 included the write-off of deferred debt financing costs and unamortized discount of $2.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, relating to the prepayment of borrowings under the tranche B term loans. 11 Other income for fiscal 2014 includes the impact of the newly adopted presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit costs below operating profit in the amount of $1.9 million. Other income for fiscal 2015 includes the impact of the newly adopted presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs below operating profit in the amount of $0.8 million. Other income for fiscal 2016 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $0.4 million and includes the impact of the newly adopted presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs below operating profit in the amount of $1.2 million. Other income for fiscal 2017 includes remeasurement of monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars of $1.6 million and includes the impact of the newly adopted presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs below operating profit in the amount of $1.5 million.

989,Offerings 2019.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.10,Repurchase at the Option of Holders,124.10.1,Change of Control,"If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of notes will have the right to require B&G Foods to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the indenture. In the Change of Control Offer (subject to the conditions required by applicable law, if any), B&G Foods will offer a Change of Control Payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes repurchased to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, B&G Foods will mail a notice to each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and described in such notice. Holders electing to have a note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the note, with the form entitled ""Option of Holder to Elect Purchase"" on the reverse of the note completed, to the paying agent at the address specified in the notice of Change of Control Offer prior to the close of business on the third business day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. Any Change of Control Offer will be made in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, if applicable, Regulation 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder and all other applicable Federal and state securities laws in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, B&G Foods' compliance with those laws and regulations will not in and of itself cause a breach of its obligations under this covenant. On the Change of Control Payment Date, B&G Foods will, to the extent lawful: (1)  accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2)  deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or portions of notes properly tendered; and (3)  deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by B&G Foods. The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased S-44 ----- portion of the notes surrendered, if any. B&G Foods will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. The provisions described above that require B&G Foods to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the notes to require that B&G Foods repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. B&G Foods will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1)  a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by B&G Foods and purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under the caption ""—Optional Redemption,"" unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The occurrence of the events constituting a Change of Control under the indenture could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement and under B&G Foods' or its Subsidiaries' other Credit Facilities and debt instruments. The definition of ""change of control"" under the Credit Agreement is substantially the same as that in the indenture. Following such an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders under the Credit Agreement or such other Credit Facilities and debt instruments would have the right to require the immediate repayment of the Indebtedness thereunder in full, and might have the right to require such repayment prior to the Change of Control Payment Date on which B&G Foods would be required to repurchase the notes. No assurances can be given that B&G Foods will have funds available or otherwise will be able to purchase any notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control. The provisions of the indenture relating to a Change of Control in and of themselves may not afford holders of the notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect holders of the notes if such transaction is not the type of transaction included within the definition of a Change of Control. A transaction involving management or Affiliates of B&G Foods likewise will result in a Change of Control only if it is the type of transaction specified by the definition. The existence of the foregoing provisions relating to a Change of Control may or may not deter a third party from seeking to acquire us in a transaction which constitutes a Change of Control and may or may not discourage or make more difficult the removal of incumbent management. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of ""all or substantially all"" of the properties or assets of B&G Foods and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ""substantially all,"" there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require B&G Foods to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of B&G Foods and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. The provisions of the indenture related to B&G Foods' obligations to make a Change of Control Offer may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding.

In the Change of Control Offer (subject to the conditions required by applicable law, if any), B&G Foods will offer a Change of Control Payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes repurchased to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, B&G Foods will mail a notice to each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and described in such notice.

B&G Foods will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. The provisions described above that require B&G Foods to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the notes to require that B&G Foods repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. B&G Foods will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1)  a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by B&G Foods and purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under the caption \""\u2014Optional Redemption,\"" unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.

Following such an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders under the Credit Agreement or such other Credit Facilities and debt instruments would have the right to require the immediate repayment of the Indebtedness thereunder in full, and might have the right to require such repayment prior to the Change of Control Payment Date on which B&G Foods would be required to repurchase the notes. No assurances can be given that B&G Foods will have funds available or otherwise will be able to purchase any notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control. The provisions of the indenture relating to a Change of Control in and of themselves may not afford holders of the notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect holders of the notes if such transaction is not the type of transaction included within the definition of a Change of Control. A transaction involving management or Affiliates of B&G Foods likewise will result in a Change of Control only if it is the type of transaction specified by the definition. The existence of the foregoing provisions relating to a Change of Control may or may not deter a third party from seeking to acquire us in a transaction which constitutes a Change of Control and may or may not discourage or make more difficult the removal of incumbent management.

For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash: (a)  any liabilities, as shown on B&G Foods' most recent consolidated balance sheet, of B&G Foods or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the notes or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and B&G Foods or such Restricted Subsidiary is released from further liability; (b)  any securities, notes or other obligations received by B&G Foods or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by B&G Foods or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days after such Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; (c)  any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by B&G Foods or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $100.0 million or (ii) 3.0% of Total Assets, with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and with giving effect to subsequent changes in value; and (d)  any stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (2) or (4) of the next paragraph of this covenant. Any Asset Sale pursuant to a condemnation, appropriation or other similar taking, including by deed in lieu of condemnation, or pursuant to the foreclosure or other enforcement of a Permitted Lien or exercise by the related lienholder of rights with respect to any of the foregoing, including by deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure, will not be required to satisfy the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph. Within 360 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, B&G Foods (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds, at its option: (1)  to repay, prepay or purchase Indebtedness and other Obligations under a Credit Facility and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (2)  to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another Permitted Business, or to acquire any Capital Stock of another Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods; (3)  to make a capital expenditure; (4)  to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets under GAAP and that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or (5)  any combination of the foregoing clauses (1) through (4). S-46 ----- In the case of clauses (2) and (4) above, B&G Foods will be deemed to have complied with its obligations in the preceding paragraph if it enters into a binding commitment to acquire such assets or Capital Stock prior to 360 days after the receipt of the applicable Net Proceeds; provided that such binding commitment will be subject only to customary conditions and such acquisition is completed within 180 days following the expiration of the aforementioned 360 day period. If the acquisition contemplated by such binding commitment is not consummated on or before such 180th day, and B&G Foods has not applied the applicable Net Proceeds for another purpose permitted by the preceding paragraph on or before such 180th day, such commitment shall be deemed not to have been a permitted application of Net Proceeds. Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, B&G Foods may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute ""Excess Proceeds."" When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $25.0 million, within 30 days thereof, B&G Foods will make an Asset Sale Offer to all holders of notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the notes (containing provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with respect to offers) to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, B&G Foods may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or required to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the trustee will select the notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. Any Asset Sale Offer will be made in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, if applicable, Regulation 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder and all other applicable Federal and state securities laws. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, B&G Foods' compliance with those laws and regulations will not in and of itself cause a breach of its obligations under this covenant. The agreements governing B&G Foods' other Indebtedness contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute an Asset Sale. The exercise by the holders of notes of their right to require B&G Foods to repurchase the notes upon an Asset Sale could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on B&G Foods. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when B&G Foods is prohibited from purchasing notes, B&G Foods could seek the consent of its senior lenders to purchase notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If B&G Foods does not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, B&G Foods will remain prohibited from purchasing notes. In that case, B&G Foods' failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under the other indebtedness. Finally, B&G Foods' ability to pay cash to the holders of notes upon a repurchase may be limited by B&G Foods' then existing financial resources.

Within 360 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, B&G Foods (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds, at its option: (1)  to repay, prepay or purchase Indebtedness and other Obligations under a Credit Facility and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (2)  to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another Permitted Business, or to acquire any Capital Stock of another Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods; (3)  to make a capital expenditure; (4)  to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets under GAAP and that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or (5)  any combination of the foregoing clauses (1) through (4). S-46 ----- In the case of clauses (2) and (4) above, B&G Foods will be deemed to have complied with its obligations in the preceding paragraph if it enters into a binding commitment to acquire such assets or Capital Stock prior to 360 days after the receipt of the applicable Net Proceeds; provided that such binding commitment will be subject only to customary conditions and such acquisition is completed within 180 days following the expiration of the aforementioned 360 day period. If the acquisition contemplated by such binding commitment is not consummated on or before such 180th day, and B&G Foods has not applied the applicable Net Proceeds for another purpose permitted by the preceding paragraph on or before such 180th day, such commitment shall be deemed not to have been a permitted application of Net Proceeds. Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, B&G Foods may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute \""Excess Proceeds.\"" When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $25.0 million, within 30 days thereof, B&G Foods will make an Asset Sale Offer to all holders of notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the notes (containing provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with respect to offers) to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, B&G Foods may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or required to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the trustee will select the notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. Any Asset Sale Offer will be made in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, if applicable, Regulation 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder and all other applicable Federal and state securities laws. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, B&G Foods' compliance with those laws and regulations will not in and of itself cause a breach of its obligations under this covenant. The agreements governing B&G Foods' other Indebtedness contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute an Asset Sale. The exercise by the holders of notes of their right to require B&G Foods to repurchase the notes upon an Asset Sale could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on B&G Foods. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when B&G Foods is prohibited from purchasing notes, B&G Foods could seek the consent of its senior lenders to purchase notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If B&G Foods does not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, B&G Foods will remain prohibited from purchasing notes. In that case, B&G Foods' failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under the other indebtedness. Finally, B&G Foods' ability to pay cash to the holders of notes upon a repurchase may be limited by B&G Foods' then existing financial resources.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to B&G Foods, any Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries of B&G Foods that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately. Holders of the notes may not enforce the indenture or the notes except as provided in the indenture. Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes may direct the trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The trustee may withhold from holders of the notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it S-62 ----- determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or premium, if any.

Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any, when due, no holder of a note may pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture or the notes unless: (1)  such holder has previously given the trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2)  holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes have requested the trustee to pursue the remedy; (3)  such holders have offered the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4)  the trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5)  holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes have not given the trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes by notice to the trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium, if any, on, or the principal of, the notes.

B&G Foods takes no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. However, B&G Foods will remain responsible for any actions DTC and participants take in accordance with instructions provided by B&G Foods. DTC has advised B&G Foods that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the ""Participants"") and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC's system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the ""Indirect Participants""). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants.

All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on behalf of the Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or ""holders"" thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, B&G Foods and the trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.

DTC has advised B&G Foods that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC.

Neither B&G Foods nor the trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and B&G Foods and the trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Transfers between the Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC's procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds. DTC has advised B&G Foods that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction.

It is possible, however, that the IRS may take a contrary position from that described above, in which case the tax consequences to a holder could differ materially and adversely from those described below.

989,Offerings 2019.md,2087,MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,2087.3,Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,2087.3.1,,"The following discussion applies only to Non-U.S. Holders (as defined above). _Taxation of Interest_ Subject to the discussion below under ""—Income or Gains Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business,"" payments of interest to Non-U.S. Holders are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a reduced or zero rate under the terms of an applicable income tax treaty between the United States and the Non-U.S. Holder's country of residence), collected by means of withholding by the payor. Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, payments of interest on the notes to a Non-U.S. Holder that qualify as ""portfolio interest"" will be exempt from U.S. federal income tax, including withholding of such tax, if the Non-U.S. Holder certifies its nonresident status as described below. The portfolio interest exception will not apply to payments of interest to a Non-U.S. Holder that: - owns, actually or constructively, shares of our stock representing at least 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote; - is a ""controlled foreign corporation"" that is related, actually or constructively, to us through sufficient stock ownership; - is a bank receiving the interest pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of the Non-U.S. Holder's trade or business; or - does not certify its nonresident status as described below, or the applicable withholding agent has actual knowledge or reason to know the holder is a United States person. In general, a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation if more than 50 percent of its stock (by either voting power or value) is owned, actually or constructively, by one or more United States persons that each owns, actually or constructively, at least 10 percent of its stock (by either voting power or value). The portfolio interest exception, entitlement to treaty benefits and several of the special rules for Non-U.S. Holders described below apply only if the holder certifies its nonresident status under penalties of perjury. A Non-U.S. Holder can generally meet this certification requirement by providing a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or other applicable IRS Form W-8 or appropriate substitute form to our paying agent prior to the payment. If treaty benefits are claimed, the Non-U.S. Holder may be required to provide a taxpayer identification number on IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E. If the Non-U.S. Holder holds its notes through a financial institution or other agent acting on the holder's behalf, the holder will be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent. The Non-U.S. Holder's agent will then be required to provide certification to our paying agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. For payments made to a foreign partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes), the certification requirements generally apply to the partners rather than the partnership, and the partnership must provide the partners' documentation to us or our paying agent. _Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_ Non-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of notes (other than with respect to payments attributable to accrued interest, which will be taxed as described under ""—Taxation of S-90 ----- Interest"" above). This general rule, however, is subject to several exceptions. For example, the gain would be subject to U.S. federal income tax if: - the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a U.S. trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, the gain is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder), in which case it would be subject to tax as described below under ""—Income or Gains Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business;"" or - subject to certain exceptions, the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are satisfied, in which case, except as otherwise provided by an applicable income tax treaty, the gain would be subject to a flat 30 percent tax, which may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses, even if the individual is not considered a resident of the U.S., provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. _Income or Gains Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business_ The preceding discussion of the U.S. federal income and withholding tax considerations of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes by a NonU.S. Holder assumes that any interest on the notes or any gain realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes is not effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States, if any, conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder. If any interest on the notes or gain from the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder, then the income or gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular graduated rates in the same manner as the income or gain of a U.S. Holder. If the NonU.S. Holder is eligible for the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty between the U.S. and the holder's country of residence, any ""effectively connected"" income or gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the holder in the United States. Payments of interest that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder), and therefore included in the gross income of a Non-U.S. Holder, will not be subject to the 30 percent withholding tax described above; provided, that the holder claims exemption from withholding. To claim exemption from withholding in the case of U.S. trade or business income, or to claim the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder must certify its qualification, which generally can be done by filing a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8ECI (in the case of a U.S. trade or business income) or properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (in the case of a treaty), or any successor form as the IRS designates, as applicable, prior to the payment of interest. If the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, that portion of its earnings and profits that is effectively connected with its U.S. trade or business may also be subject to an additional ""branch profits tax"" at a 30% rate (or, if applicable, a lower income tax treaty rate). _Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_ Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (""FATCA""), withholding taxes may apply to certain types of payments made to ""foreign financial institutions"" (as specially defined in the Code) and certain other nonU.S. entities, including foreign financial institutions and other entities acting as an intermediary. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on interest on notes paid to a foreign financial institution or to a non-financial foreign entity, unless (1) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any substantial United States owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity S-91 ----- otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements in clause (1) above, then, pursuant to an agreement between it and the U.S. Treasury, it must, among other things, identify accounts held by certain United States persons or United States-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to noncompliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders. Under the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of interest on a note. While withholding under FATCA would have applied also to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a note on or after January 1, 2019, recently proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations until final U.S. Treasury Regulations are issued. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States with respect to FATCA may be subject to different rules.

The Non-U.S. Holder's agent will then be required to provide certification to our paying agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. For payments made to a foreign partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes), the certification requirements generally apply to the partners rather than the partnership, and the partnership must provide the partners' documentation to us or our paying agent. _Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_ Non-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of notes (other than with respect to payments attributable to accrued interest, which will be taxed as described under \""\u2014Taxation of S-90 ----- Interest\"" above). This general rule, however, is subject to several exceptions. For example, the gain would be subject to U.S. federal income tax if: - the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a U.S. trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, the gain is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder), in which case it would be subject to tax as described below under \""\u2014Income or Gains Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business;\"" or - subject to certain exceptions, the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are satisfied, in which case, except as otherwise provided by an applicable income tax treaty, the gain would be subject to a flat 30 percent tax, which may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses, even if the individual is not considered a resident of the U.S., provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. _Income or Gains Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business_ The preceding discussion of the U.S. federal income and withholding tax considerations of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes by a NonU.S. Holder assumes that any interest on the notes or any gain realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes is not effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States, if any, conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder. If any interest on the notes or gain from the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder, then the income or gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular graduated rates in the same manner as the income or gain of a U.S. Holder. If the NonU.S. Holder is eligible for the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty between the U.S. and the holder's country of residence, any \""effectively connected\"" income or gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the holder in the United States. Payments of interest that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder), and therefore included in the gross income of a Non-U.S. Holder, will not be subject to the 30 percent withholding tax described above; provided, that the holder claims exemption from withholding. To claim exemption from withholding in the case of U.S. trade or business income, or to claim the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder must certify its qualification, which generally can be done by filing a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8ECI (in the case of a U.S. trade or business income) or properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (in the case of a treaty), or any successor form as the IRS designates, as applicable, prior to the payment of interest. If the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, that portion of its earnings and profits that is effectively connected with its U.S. trade or business may also be subject to an additional \""branch profits tax\"" at a 30% rate (or, if applicable, a lower income tax treaty rate). _Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_ Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (\""FATCA\""), withholding taxes may apply to certain types of payments made to \""foreign financial institutions\"" (as specially defined in the Code) and certain other nonU.S. entities, including foreign financial institutions and other entities acting as an intermediary. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on interest on notes paid to a foreign financial institution or to a non-financial foreign entity, unless (1) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any substantial United States owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity S-91 ----- otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements in clause (1) above, then, pursuant to an agreement between it and the U.S. Treasury, it must, among other things, identify accounts held by certain United States persons or United States-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to noncompliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders. Under the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of interest on a note. While withholding under FATCA would have applied also to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a note on or after January 1, 2019, recently proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations until final U.S. Treasury Regulations are issued. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States with respect to FATCA may be subject to different rules. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding FATCA, the U.S. Treasury Regulations thereunder and any applicable intergovernmental agreements with respect to FATCA.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}","{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder ('FATCA'), withholding taxes may apply to certain types of payments made to 'foreign financial institutions' (as specially defined in the Code) and certain other non-U.S. entities, including foreign financial institutions and other entities acting as an intermediary.\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder ('FATCA'), withholding taxes may apply to certain types of payments made to 'foreign financial institutions' (as specially defined in the Code) and certain other non-U.S. entities, including foreign financial institutions and other entities acting as an intermediary.""}, ""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder ('FATCA'), withholding taxes may apply to certain types of payments made to 'foreign financial institutions' (as specially defined in the Code) and certain other non-U.S. entities, including foreign financial institutions and other entities acting as an intermediary."", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the industry is subject to a high degree of regulatory scrutiny?\nTitle: nan\nText: The following discussion applies only to Non-U.S. Holders (as defined above). _Taxation of Interest_ Subject to the discussion below under \""\u2014Income or Gains Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business,\"" payments of interest to Non-U.S. Holders are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a reduced or zero rate under the terms of an applicable income tax treaty between the United States and the Non-U.S. Holder's country of residence), collected by means of withholding by the payor. Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, payments of interest on the notes to a Non-U.S. Holder that qualify as \""portfolio interest\"" will be exempt from U.S. federal income tax, including withholding of such tax, if the Non-U.S. Holder certifies its nonresident status as described below. The portfolio interest exception will not apply to payments of interest to a Non-U.S. Holder that: - owns, actually or constructively, shares of our stock representing at least 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote; - is a \""controlled foreign corporation\"" that is related, actually or constructively, to us through sufficient stock ownership; - is a bank receiving the interest pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of the Non-U.S. Holder's trade or business; or - does not certify its nonresident status as described below, or the applicable withholding agent has actual knowledge or reason to know the holder is a United States person. In general, a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation if more than 50 percent of its stock (by either voting power or value) is owned, actually or constructively, by one or more United States persons that each owns, actually or constructively, at least 10 percent of its stock (by either voting power or value). The portfolio interest exception, entitlement to treaty benefits and several of the special rules for Non-U.S. Holders described below apply only if the holder certifies its nonresident status under penalties of perjury. A Non-U.S. Holder can generally meet this certification requirement by providing a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or other applicable IRS Form W-8 or appropriate substitute form to our paying agent prior to the payment. If treaty benefits are claimed, the Non-U.S. Holder may be required to provide a taxpayer identification number on IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E.

This section does not provide a complete analysis of all potential tax considerations. The information provided below is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \""Code\""), U.S. Treasury Regulations, Internal Revenue Service (\""IRS\"") rulings and pronouncements, and judicial decisions all as now in effect and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. There can be no assurances that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences described herein, and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning or disposing of the notes. This section generally applies only to beneficial owners of the notes that purchase their notes in this offering for an amount equal to the issue price of the notes, which is the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for money to the public (not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of initial purchasers, placement agents or wholesalers), and that hold the notes as capital assets. This discussion does not purport to deal with all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular beneficial owner in light of the beneficial owner's circumstances (for example, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code, or a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose \""functional currency\"" is not the U.S. dollar). Also, it is not intended to be applicable to all categories of investors, some of whom may be subject to special rules (such as dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting, banks, thrifts or other financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, any entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, tax-deferred or other retirement accounts, a beneficial owner of the notes subject to the special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code, certain former citizens or residents of the United States, persons holding notes as part of a hedging, conversion or integrated transaction or a straddle, or persons deemed to sell notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code). The amortizable bond premium or market discount rules may apply to any investor who purchases notes at a price other than the issue price and pursuant to this offering memorandum, and investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding this possibility. Finally, this section does not describe the effect of the U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws or the effects of any applicable foreign, state or local laws.

The number of authorized shares of our preferred stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our common stock, without a vote of the holders of any other class or series of our preferred stock unless required by the terms of such class or series of preferred stock. Our preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms designed to delay or prevent a change in the control of our company or to make the removal of our management more difficult. This could have the effect of discouraging third-party bids for our common stock or may otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We believe that the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of our preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions, and in meeting other corporate needs that might arise. The authorized shares of our preferred stock, as well as shares of our common stock, will be available for issuance without action by our common stockholders, unless such action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded. Although our board of directors has no intention at the present time of doing so, it could issue a series of our preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such series, be used to implement a stockholder rights plan or otherwise impede the completion of a merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt of our company. Our board of directors could issue preferred stock having terms that could discourage an acquisition attempt through which an acquiror may be able to change the composition of the board of directors, including a tender offer or other transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then current market price.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a ""business combination"" with an ""interested stockholder"" for a three-year period following the time that this stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A ""business combination"" includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An ""interested stockholder"" is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or, in some cases, within three years prior, did own) 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. Under Section 203, a business combination between the corporation and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless it satisfies one of the following conditions: - the board of directors must have previously approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; - upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding, for purposes of determining the number of our shares outstanding, shares owned by (a) persons who are directors and also officers and (b) employee stock plans, in some instances); or - the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.

In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \""business combination\"" with an \""interested stockholder\"" for a three-year period following the time that this stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A \""business combination\"" includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An \""interested stockholder\"" is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or, in some cases, within three years prior, did own) 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. Under Section 203, a business combination between the corporation and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless it satisfies one of the following conditions: - the board of directors must have previously approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; - upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding, for purposes of determining the number of our shares outstanding, shares owned by (a) persons who are directors and also officers and (b) employee stock plans, in some instances); or - the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of our common stock. 5 ----- Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain several provisions, in addition to those pertaining to the issuance of additional shares of our authorized common stock and preferred stock without the approval of the holders of our common stock that could delay or make more difficult the acquisition of our company through a hostile tender offer, open market purchases, proxy contest, merger or other takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in his or her best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of our common stock. Such provisions, which are described below, include advance notice procedures regarding any proposal of stockholder business to be discussed at a stockholders meeting. _Advance Notice Procedure for Director Nominations and Stockholder Proposals.  Our bylaws provide that, subject to the rights of holders of any_ outstanding shares of our preferred stock, a stockholder may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of the stockholder's nomination has been given, either by personal delivery or certified mail, to our corporate secretary not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days before the first anniversary of the date of our proxy statement in connection with our last annual meeting of stockholders.

Neither the amendment or repeal of this provision of our certificate of incorporation, nor the adoption of any provision of our certificate of incorporation which is inconsistent with this provision, shall eliminate or reduce the protection afforded by this provision with respect to any matter which occurred, or any suit or claim which, but for this provision would have accrued or arisen, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption. Our bylaws also provide that we shall, to the fullest extent from time to time permitted by law, indemnify our directors and officers against all liabilities and expenses in any suit or proceeding, arising out of their status as an officer or director or their activities in these capacities. Our bylaws also require us to indemnify any person who, at our request, is or was serving as a director, officer or trustee of another corporation, joint venture, employee benefit plan trust or other enterprise. 7 ----- receive an undertaking to repay such amount if it shall be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified. Our board of directors may take such action as it deems necessary to carry out these indemnification provisions, including adopting procedures for determining and enforcing indemnification rights and purchasing insurance policies. Our board of directors may also adopt bylaws, resolutions or contracts implementing indemnification arrangements as may be permitted by law. Neither the amendment or repeal of these indemnification provisions, nor the adoption of any provision of our certificate of incorporation inconsistent with these indemnification provisions, shall eliminate or reduce any rights to indemnification relating to their status or any activities prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption. We believe these provisions will assist in attracting and retaining qualified individuals to serve as directors.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

However, unless otherwise noted in the prospectus supplement, subordinated debt securities will be subordinate and junior in right of payment to any existing senior indebtedness. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, under the applicable indenture, ""senior indebtedness"" means all amounts due on obligations in connection with any of the following, whether outstanding at the date of execution of the applicable indenture, or thereafter incurred or created: - the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest due on our indebtedness for borrowed money and indebtedness evidenced by bonds, notes, debentures or similar instruments or letters of credit (or reimbursement agreements in respect thereof); - all of our capital lease obligations or attributable debt (as will be defined in the applicable indenture) in respect of sale and leaseback transactions; - all obligations representing the balance deferred and unpaid of the purchase price of any property or services, which purchase price is due more than six months after the date of placing such property in service or taking delivery and title thereto, except any such balance that constitutes an accrued expense or trade payable or any similar obligation to trade creditors; - all of our obligations in respect of interest rate swap agreements (whether from fixed to floating or from floating to fixed), interest rate cap agreements and interest rate collar agreements; other agreements or arrangements designed to manage interest rates or interest rate risk; and other agreements or arrangements designed to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates or commodity prices; - all obligations of the types referred to above of other persons for the payment of which we are responsible or liable as obligor, guarantor or otherwise; and - all obligations of the types referred to above of other persons secured by any lien on any property or asset of ours (whether or not such obligation is assumed by us). However, senior indebtedness does not include: - any indebtedness which expressly provides that such indebtedness shall not be senior in right of payment to the subordinated debt securities, or that such indebtedness shall be subordinated to any other of our indebtedness, unless such indebtedness expressly provides that such indebtedness shall be senior in right of payment to the subordinated debt securities; - any of our obligations to our subsidiaries or of a subsidiary guarantor to us or any other of our other subsidiaries; 11 ----- - any accounts payable or other liability to trade creditors arising in the ordinary course of business (including guarantees thereof or instruments evidencing such liabilities); - any obligations with respect to any capital stock; - any indebtedness incurred in violation of the applicable indenture, provided that indebtedness under our credit facilities will not cease to be senior indebtedness under this bullet point if the lenders of such indebtedness obtained an officer's certificate as of the date of incurrence of such indebtedness to the effect that such indebtedness was permitted to be incurred by the indenture; and - any of our indebtedness in respect of the subordinated debt securities.

The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the terms of the offering of the securities, including: - the name or names of any underwriters and, if required, any dealers or agents; - the purchase price of the securities and the proceeds we will receive from the sale; - any underwriting discounts and other items constituting underwriters' compensation; - any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers; and - any securities exchange or market on which the securities may be listed. We may distribute the securities from time to time in one or more transactions at: - a fixed price or prices, which may be changed; - market prices prevailing at the time of sale; - varying prices determined at the time of sale related to such prevailing market prices; or - negotiated prices. Offerings of our equity securities pursuant to this prospectus may also be made into an existing trading market for such securities in transactions at other than a fixed price, either: - on or through the facilities of any national securities exchange or quotation service on which such securities may be listed or quoted at the time of sale; or - to or through a market maker otherwise than on such exchanges. Such at-the-market offerings will be conducted by underwriters acting as our principal or agent, who may also be third-party sellers of securities as described above. Only underwriters named in the prospectus supplement will be underwriters of the securities offered by the prospectus supplement. If we use underwriters in the sale, they will acquire the securities for their own account and may resell the securities from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions, at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. We may offer the securities to the public through underwriting syndicates represented by managing underwriters or by underwriters without a syndicate. Any public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers may change from time to time. We may sell the securities directly. In this case, no underwriters or agents would be involved. We may also sell the securities through agents we designate from time to time. We will name any agent involved in the offering and sale of securities and we will describe any commissions we will pay the agent in the prospectus supplement. We may authorize agents or underwriters to solicit offers by institutional investors to purchase securities from us at the public offering price set forth in the prospectus supplement pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on a specified date in the future. We will describe the conditions to these contracts and the commissions we must pay for solicitation of these contracts in the prospectus supplement. 21 ----- - purchases by a dealer, as principal, who may then resell those securities to the public for its account at varying prices determined by the dealer at the time of resale; - block trades in which a dealer will attempt to sell as agent, but may position or resell a portion of the block, as principal, in order to facilitate the transaction; or - ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which a broker-dealer solicits purchasers. We will include in the applicable prospectus supplement the names of any dealers and the terms of the transaction. In connection with the sale of the securities, underwriters, dealers or agents may receive compensation from us or from purchasers of the securities for whom they act as agents in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions. Underwriters may sell the securities to or through dealers, and those dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agents. Underwriters, dealers and agents that participate in the distribution of the securities, and any institutional investors or others that purchase securities directly and then resell the securities, may be deemed to be underwriters, and any discounts or commissions received by them from us and any profit on the resale of the securities by them may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). We may provide agents and underwriters with indemnification against particular civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribution with respect to payments that the agents or underwriters may make with respect to such liabilities. Agents and underwriters may engage in transactions with, or perform services for, us in the ordinary course of business. In addition, we may enter into derivative transactions with third parties (including the writing of options), or sell securities not covered by this prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. If the applicable prospectus supplement indicates, in connection with such a transaction, the third parties may, pursuant to this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, sell securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement. If so, the third party may use securities borrowed from us or others to settle such sales and may use securities received from us to close out any related short positions. We may also loan or pledge securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement to third parties, who may sell the loaned securities or, in an event of default in the case of a pledge, sell the pledged securities pursuant to this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement. The third party in such sale transactions will be an underwriter and will be identified in the applicable prospectus supplement or in a post-effective amendment. Offered securities may also be offered and sold, if so indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, in connection with a remarketing upon their purchase, in accordance with a redemption or repayment pursuant to their terms, or otherwise, by one or more remarketing firms, acting as principals for their own accounts or as agents for us. Any remarketing firm will be identified and the terms of its agreements, if any, with us and its compensation will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. To facilitate an offering of a series of securities, persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain, or otherwise affect the market price of the securities. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involves the sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities than have been sold to them by us. In those circumstances, such persons would cover such over-allotments or short positions by purchasing in the open market or by exercising the over-allotment option granted to those persons. In addition, those persons may stabilize 22 ----- allowed to underwriters or dealers participating in any such offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market.
