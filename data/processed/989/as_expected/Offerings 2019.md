**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights certain information appearing elsewhere in this prospectus supplement and should be read together with the more_
_detailed information and financial data and statements contained elsewhere in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the_
_accompanying prospectus._

**Our Company**

**Overview**

We manufacture, sell and distribute a diverse portfolio of branded, high quality, shelf-stable and frozen food and household products across the
United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Many of our branded products have leading regional or national market shares. In general, we position our
products to appeal to the consumer desiring a high quality and reasonably priced product. We complement our branded product retail sales with
institutional and foodservice sales and private label sales. Our business is characterized by a stable and growing revenue base from our existing product
portfolio and is augmented by acquisitions of highly attractive, shelf-stable and frozen brands. Additionally, we generate strong cash flows as a result
of our attractive margins, efficient working capital management, modest capital expenditure requirements and tax efficiencies achieved through our
acquisitions. We believe that these characteristics enable our company to be a leader in successfully achieving sales growth for shelf-stable and frozen
branded products and executing an aggressive, disciplined acquisition strategy.

B&G Foods, including our subsidiaries and predecessors, has been in business for over 125 years. We have a well established sales, marketing and
distribution infrastructure that enables us to sell our products in all major U.S. food distribution channels. These channels include supermarkets, mass
merchants, wholesalers, food service accounts, warehouse clubs, non-food outlets, such as drug store chains and dollar stores, specialty distributors,
military commissaries and e-tailers. We have developed and leveraged this infrastructure through our acquisition of more than 50 high quality brands
since 1996. Our history includes a number of acquisitions of non-core brands from large, global packaged food companies, such as the B&M,
_Underwood, Ac'cent, Joan of Arc, Sa-són Ac'cent and Las Palmas brands from Pillsbury in 1999, the Ortega brand from Nestlé in 2003, the Grandma's_
_Molasses brand from Cadbury Schweppes in 2006, the Cream of Wheat and Cream of Rice brands from Kraft in 2007, the Mrs. Dash, Sugar Twin,_
_Baker's Joy, Molly McButter and Static Guard brands from Unilever in 2011, the New York Style, Old London, Devonsheer and JJ Flats brands from_
Chipita America in 2012, the Green Giant and Le Sueur brands from General Mills in 2015, the Spice Islands, Tone's, Durkee and Weber brands from
ACH Food Companies in 2016, the McCann's brand of premium Irish oatmeal from TreeHouse Foods in 2018 and the Clabber Girl Corporation,
including the Clabber Girl brand, from Hulman & Company in 2019. Based on our demonstrated record of successful acquisitions, we believe that we
are well-positioned as a strategic acquirer of non-core brands from large, global packaged food companies. We have also successfully acquired
businesses from smaller, private companies, as well as private equity and individual sellers, including Back to Nature Foods Company, LLC and
related entities, including the Back to Nature and SnackWell's brands, from Brynwood Partners VI L.P., and certain other sellers in 2017, Victoria Fine
Foods, LLC, including the Victoria brand, from Huron Capital Partners and certain other sellers in 2016, Spartan Foods of America, Inc., and related
entities, including the Mama Mary's brand, from Linsalata Capital Partners and certain other sellers in 2015; Specialty Brands of America, including
the Bear Creek Country Kitchens, Spring Tree, Cary's, MacDonald's, New York Flatbreads and Canoleo brands, from affiliates of American Capital in
2014; and the TrueNorth brand from DeMet's Candy Company in 2013.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that our success in the packaged food industry and our financial results are due in large part to the following competitive strengths:

_Portfolio of high-margin brands with leading market positions in key growth categories.  We are focused on operating smaller, high-margin_
brands. We have assembled a diverse portfolio of brands consisting primarily of niche or specialty products with strong market positions and high
operating income margins. Several of our brands compete in categories that benefit from positive consumer spending trends. For example, our Green
_Giant and Le Sueur brands compete in a category well-positioned to benefit from the health and wellness trend, our Back to Nature products compete_
in the "better-for-you" snack category, and our Ortega, Las Palmas and Sa-són Ac'cent brands compete in the U.S. Mexican and Hispanic market
category. We believe that our diverse product portfolio provides a strong platform to capture growth in the packaged food industry and to generate
strong profitability and significant cash flows while mitigating the financial impact of competitive pressure or commodity cost increases in any single
brand or product.

_Well-developed and proven acquisition platform.  We believe that our focus branded products, favorable relationships with retailers, operations_
and marketing expertise and leading acquisition integration capabilities allow us to be highly successful in growing our product and brand portfolio.
We have acquired and successfully integrated over 50 brands since 1996. We seek to acquire shelf-stable and frozen food brands with leading market
positions, identifiable growth opportunities and high and sustainable margins that will add to our cash flows and return on capital. Our focus on shelfstable and frozen branded products allows us to drive attractive profitability and gain efficiencies from our sales and distribution and general and
administrative systems. We believe that our acquisition expertise and ability to integrate businesses quickly lead to successful expansion of acquired
brands and the realization of significant cost synergies. As a result, we believe that we are an acquirer preferred by large, global packaged food
companies for their non-core brands. We have successfully completed acquisitions from sellers such as Treehouse Foods, ACH Food Companies,
General Mills, Chipita America, Unilever, Kraft, Cadbury Schweppes, Nestlé, Pillsbury and Nabisco. Our acquisitions of the Back to Nature, Clabber
_Girl, Tone's, Weber, Green Giant, Mama Mary's, Bear Creek Country Kitchens, Mrs. Dash, Cream of Wheat and Ortega brands are examples of our_
ability to acquire leading shelf-stable brands with high profitability from large packaged food companies and private investors.

_Track record of new product introductions.  We have demonstrated the ability to develop new products and product extensions rapidly, and we_
have been able to deliver these new products to our customers quickly. We have generally been able to develop these products from concept to final
product and deliver these products to our customers' shelves within six months of development. We work directly with certain of our customers to
implement new product introduction in markets where we expect significant growth. For example, new products we have introduced in recent years
include Green Giant Veggie Spirals, Green Giant Cauliflower Pizza Crust, Green Giant Harvest Protein Bowls, Little Green Sprout's Organics Veggie
Spirals, Green Giant Veggie Tots, Green Giant Riced Veggies, Green Giant Mashed Cauliflower, Cream of Wheat To-Go Cups, Crock-Pot Seasoning
Mixes, No Salt Added Joan of Arc Kidney Beans, Bear Creek Country Kitchens Dry Soup Mix Bowls, Ortega Reduced Sodium Taco Seasoning and
_Ortega Fiesta Flats Flat Bottom Taco Shells._

_Diversity of customers and distribution channels.  We sell our products through all major U.S. food distribution channels, including_
supermarkets, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, wholesalers, food service accounts, specialty distributors, military commissaries and non-food outlets
such as drug store chains and dollar stores. We have strong, long standing, national relationships with all our major customers. Our customers include
Walmart, Kroger, Publix, C&S Wholesale Grocers, US Foods, Supervalu, Safeway, Wakefern, Cracker Barrel, Costco, Target and Sysco. The breadth of
our multiple-channel sales and distribution system allows us to capitalize on above-average growth trends within

S-2


-----

certain of these distribution channels and expand distribution of acquired brands. Our diverse distribution channels have also contributed to our ability
to maintain a broad customer base, with sales to our ten largest customers accounting for 54.4% of our net sales for fiscal 2018.

_Strong cash flow generation.  We have generated significant cash flows from our operations. Beginning with fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2018, we_
have generated cumulative net cash provided by operating activities of $764.6 million. Our strong financial performance is a result of our attractive
operating income margins, efficient working capital management, modest capital expenditure requirements and tax efficiencies achieved through our
acquisitions. Our business continues to be positioned to generate strong cash flows.

_Experienced management team with proven track record.  Our management team is a strong, complementary combination of relatively new_
arrivals with fresh ideas and long-term B&G Foods veterans with long-standing experience managing our business in a highly competitive
environment, and all of whom have extensive food industry experience and long standing experience managing our company in a highly competitive
environment. Our management team has acquired and integrated over 50 brands successfully since 1996 and has developed and implemented a
business strategy that has enabled us to become a highly successful manufacturer and distributor of a diverse portfolio of high quality, branded, shelfstable and frozen food products.

**Growth Strategy**

Our goal is to continue to increase sales, profitability and cash flows by enhancing our existing portfolio of shelf-stable and frozen branded
products and by capitalizing on our competitive strengths. We intend to implement our growth strategy through the following initiatives:

_Expand brand portfolio with acquisitions of complementary branded businesses.  We intend to continue expanding our brand portfolio by_
acquiring shelf-stable and frozen brands with leading market positions, strong brand equity, distribution expansion opportunities and compelling cost
efficiencies at attractive valuations. We believe we can continue our track record of building and improving acquired brands post-acquisition through
increased management focus and integration into our well-established manufacturing, sales, distribution and administrative infrastructure. We believe
we are well-positioned as a preferred acquirer to capitalize on the trend of large packaged food companies divesting smaller, non-core, yet profitable,
brands to increase their focus on their large, global brands.

_Continue to develop new products and deliver them to market quickly.  We intend to continue to leverage our new product development_
capability and our sales and distribution breadth to introduce new products and product extensions. Our management has demonstrated the ability to
launch new products quickly. Examples of the new products we have introduced in recent years are listed above under "Our Competitive Strengths
—Track record of new product introductions."

_Leverage our multiple-channel sales and distribution system.  Our multiple-channel sales and distribution system allows us to capitalize on_
growth opportunities through the quick and efficient introduction of new and acquired products to our customers. We continue to strengthen our sales
and distribution system in order to realize distribution economies of scale and provide an efficient, national platform for new products by expanding
distribution channels, enlarging geographic reach, more effectively managing trade spending, improving packaging and introducing line extensions.

_Continue to focus on higher growth distribution channels and customers.  We sell our products through all major U.S. food distribution_
channels, including supermarkets, mass merchants, wholesalers, food service accounts, warehouse clubs, specialty distributors, military commissaries
and non-food outlets such as drug store chains and dollar stores. Our distribution breadth allows us to benefit from high growth channels such as mass
merchants, warehouse and club stores, specialty distributors,

convenience stores, drug stores, e-tailers, vending machines and food services. We intend to continue to create products specific to our higher growth
distribution channels and customers.

**Ranking** The notes and the subsidiary guarantees will be our and the guarantors' general unsecured
obligations and:

                            - will be effectively junior in right of payment to all of our and the guarantors' secured

indebtedness, including term loans and revolving loans under the senior secured credit
facility, to the extent of the value of the assets pledged to secure those obligations;

                            - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of

our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes;

                            - will be pari passu in right of payment to all of our and the guarantors' existing and future

unsecured senior debt, including the 2025 notes; and

                            - will be senior in right of payment to all of our and the guarantors' future subordinated debt.

principal amount of outstanding senior unsecured debt. In addition, as of June 29, 2019, after
giving effect to the completion of this offering, the new term loan borrowings under our senior
secured credit facility and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had the ability to
borrow up to $670.7 million under our revolving credit facility (net of $1.6 million reserved for
issued and outstanding letters of credit), which would be effectively senior in right of payment
to the notes.

As of June 29, 2019, after giving effect to the completion of this offering, the new term loan
borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and the use of proceeds therefrom, our three
foreign subsidiaries, B&G Foods Canada, ULC, B&G Foods Manufacturing Mexico, S. de R.L.
de C.V. and Sirops Maple Grove Inc., that do not guarantee the notes would have no
indebtedness outstanding other than intercompany indebtedness. As of June 29, 2019, the total
assets and total liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries were approximately $123.9 million
and $25.3 million, respectively, and, for the two quarters ended June 29, 2019, our nonguarantor subsidiaries generated approximately $101.6 million and $2.5 million of our net sales
and net income, respectively.

consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

2 Net sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating income and other income for fiscal 2016 and 2017
have been adjusted as a result of our retrospective adoption of new accounting standards relating to revenue recognition and the

10 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management to measure operating performance. A
non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of our financial performance that excludes or includes amounts
so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our
consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows. We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt (see footnote (10) above). We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for
cash and non-cash acquisition/divestiture-related expenses, gains and losses (which may include third party fees and expenses,
integration, restructuring and consolidation expenses, amortization of acquired inventory fair value step-up and gains and losses
on the sale of assets); non-recurring expenses, gains and losses; gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of contingent
liabilities from earn-outs; the non-cash accounting impact of our inventory reduction plan; intangible asset impairment charges
and related asset write-offs; loss on product recalls, including customer refunds, selling, general and administrative expenses and
the impact on cost of sales; and distribution restructuring expenses. Management believes that it is useful to eliminate these
items because it allows management to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance
and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to,
among other things, evaluate our operating performance, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets,
determine employee bonuses and evaluate our cash flows in terms of cash needs. We also present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA
because we believe they are useful indicators of our historical debt capacity and ability to service debt and because covenants in
our credit agreement and our senior notes indentures contain ratios based on these measures. As a result, reports used by internal
management during monthly operating reviews feature the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA metrics. However, management uses
these metrics in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance and liquidity measures as part of its overall
assessment of company performance and liquidity, and therefore does not place undue reliance on these measures as its only
measures of operating performance and liquidity.

EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income,
net income or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not
complete net cash flow measures because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are measures of liquidity that do not include
reductions for cash payments for an entity's obligation to service its debt, fund its working capital, capital expenditures and
acquisitions and pay its income taxes and dividends. Rather, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are two potential indicators of an
entity's ability to fund these cash requirements. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete measures of an entity's
profitability because they do not include certain costs and expenses and gains and losses described above. Because not all
companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures of other companies. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA can still be useful in evaluating our
performance against our peer companies because management believes these measures provide users with valuable insight into
key components of GAAP amounts.

**Risks Relating to this Offering**

**We have substantial indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to service the notes and impact our financing options and liquidity position.**

We currently have and following this offering will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of June 29, 2019, after giving effect to the
completion of this offering, the new term loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and the use of proceeds therefrom, including redemption of
the 2021 notes, we would have had $477.7 million principal amount of outstanding senior secured debt and $1.35 billion principal amount of outstanding
senior unsecured debt. In addition, as of June 29, 2019, after giving effect to the completion of this offering, the new term loan borrowings under our senior
secured credit facility and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had the ability to borrow up to $670.7 million under our revolving credit facility
(net of $1.6 million reserved for issued and outstanding letters of credit).

The degree to which we are leveraged on a consolidated basis could have important consequences to the holders of the notes, including:

     - our ability in the future to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited;

     - we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;

     - a significant portion of our cash flow is likely to be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available
for future operations, capital expenditures and acquisitions; and

     - we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and be limited in our ability to withstand competitive pressures.

**Despite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks**
**associated with our substantial indebtedness.**

Although our credit agreement contains total leverage and cash interest coverage maintenance covenants and the indenture governing the 2025 notes
contains and the indenture governing the notes will contain covenants that will restrict our ability to incur debt as described under "Description of Notes"
and "Description of Certain Indebtedness," as long as we meet these financial covenant tests we will be allowed to incur additional indebtedness. In addition,
the indenture governing the 2025 notes allows us and the indenture governing the notes will allow us to issue additional notes with terms identical (other
than issuance date) to the notes we are currently offering under certain circumstances.

See "—Key terms of the notes will be terminated if the notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is
continuing."

**To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. We**
**may not be able to repay or refinance the notes, the 2025 notes or our credit agreement upon terms acceptable to us or at all.**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, the 2025 notes and indebtedness under our credit agreement,
and to fund planned capital expenditures and potential acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations in the future. This
ability, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.

A significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to servicing our debt requirements. In addition, we currently intend to continue
distributing a significant portion of any remaining cash flow to our stockholders as dividends. Moreover, prior to the maturity of the notes, we will not be
required to make any payments of principal on the notes.

Our ability to continue to expand our business will, to a certain extent, be dependent upon our ability to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility
and to obtain other third-party financing, including through the sale of securities or the issuance of other indebtedness. Our credit agreement is subject to
periodic renewal or must otherwise be refinanced. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, including our credit agreement, the 2025 notes or the notes,
on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we would be forced to seek other alternatives, including:

     - sales of assets;

     - sales of equity; and

     - negotiations with our lenders or noteholders to restructure the applicable debt.

In addition, if we are unable to refinance our credit agreement, our failure to repay all amounts due on the maturity date would cause a default under the
indentures governing the 2025 notes and the notes.

If we are forced to pursue any of the above options, our business or the value of your investment in the notes or both could be adversely affected.

**We are a holding company and we rely on dividends, interest and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our**
**debt service and other obligations.**

We are a holding company and all of our assets are held by our direct and indirect subsidiaries. We will rely on dividends and other payments or
distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations and to enable us to pay dividends. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or
make other payments or distributions to us will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their
jurisdiction of organization (which may limit the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends), agreements of those subsidiaries, our credit
agreement, the terms of the indentures governing the 2025 notes and the notes and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our
subsidiaries incur.

S-20


-----

**We will be subject to restrictive debt covenants and other requirements related to our debt that will limit our business flexibility by imposing operating**
**and financial restrictions on our operations.**

The agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, subject to certain exceptions. These
restrictions prohibit or limit, among other things:

     - the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the issuance of certain preferred stock or redeemable capital stock;

     - a number of restricted payments, including investments;

     - specified sales of assets;

     - specified transactions with affiliates;

     - the creation of certain types of liens;

     - consolidations, mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets; and

     - entry into sale and leaseback transactions.

Our credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests, including a maximum total leverage ratio and
a minimum interest coverage ratio.

Our ability to comply with the ratios or tests may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry
conditions. A breach of any of these covenants, or failure to meet or maintain ratios or tests could result in a default under our credit agreement or the
indentures governing the 2025 notes or the notes or all such agreements. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit agreement or
the indentures governing the 2025 notes or the notes, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement, the 2025 notes
and the notes, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the credit agreement lenders
could proceed against the security granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, our assets may not
be sufficient to repay in full this indebtedness and our other indebtedness, including the notes.

**Key terms of the notes will be terminated if the notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.**

Some of the covenants in the indenture governing the notes will be terminated if the notes are rated investment grade by Standard & Poor's and Moody's
provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, including those covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to
incur additional indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade. However, termination of these covenants would
allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force, and the effects of any such transactions will be
permitted to remain in place even if the notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade. See "Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—
Effectiveness of Covenants."

**Our credit agreement and the indenture governing the 2025 notes permits us and the indenture governing the notes will permit us to pay a significant**
**portion of our free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends. Any amounts paid by us in the form of dividends to our stockholders will not be**
**available in the future to satisfy our obligations to the holders of the notes and our other indebtedness.**

Although our credit agreement and the indenture governing the 2025 notes has and the indenture governing the notes will have some limitations on our
payment of dividends, they permit us to pay a significant portion of our free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends. We intend to

S-21


-----

continue paying quarterly dividends on our common stock. Specifically, the indenture governing the 2025 notes permits us and the indenture governing the
notes will permit us to use up to 100% of our excess cash (which, as defined in the indenture, is consolidated cash flow, as defined in the indenture, minus the
sum of cash income tax expense, cash interest expense, certain capital expenditures and certain repayments of indebtedness) for the period (taken as one
accounting period) from March 31, 2013 to the end of our most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such
payments, plus certain incremental funds described in the indenture for the payment of dividends, so long as the fixed charge coverage ratio for the four most
recent fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available is not less than 1.6 to 1.0, subject to certain limitations, as more fully described in
"Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments." Our credit agreement (subject to certain financial ratio requirements) permits us to use up
to 100% of our excess cash, as described in detail in "Description of Notes—Certain Covenants" and "Description of Certain Indebtedness—Senior Secured
Credit Agreement" plus certain other amounts under certain limited circumstances to fund dividends on our shares of common stock. Any amounts paid by us
in the form of dividends will not be available in the future to satisfy our obligations to the holders of our notes and our other indebtedness.

**The realizable value of our assets upon liquidation may be insufficient to satisfy claims.**

As of June 29, 2019, our total assets included goodwill and intangible assets in the amount of $2.2 billion, representing approximately 70.0% of our
total consolidated assets. The value of these intangible assets will continue to depend significantly upon the continued profitability of our brands. As a
result, in the event of a default on the notes or any bankruptcy or dissolution of our company, the realizable value of these assets may be substantially lower
and may be insufficient to satisfy the claims of our creditors.

**We may not be able to repurchase the notes and the 2025 notes upon a change of control, as required by the indentures governing the notes and the 2025**
**notes.**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes and the outstanding
2025 notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

We may not be able to repurchase the notes or the 2025 notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient funds. Further, we may be
contractually restricted under the terms of our credit agreement from repurchasing all such notes tendered by holders upon a change of control. Accordingly,
we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to purchase your notes and the 2025 notes unless we are able to refinance or obtain waivers under the credit
agreement. Our failure to repurchase the notes or the 2025 notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indentures governing the notes and
the 2025 notes and a cross default under the credit agreement. The credit agreement also provides that a change of control, as defined in such agreement, will
be a default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and, if such debt is not paid, to enforce security interests in the collateral
securing such debt, thereby limiting our ability to raise cash to purchase the notes and the 2025 notes, and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to
purchase provisions to the holders of the notes and the 2025 notes. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions.

In addition, the change of control provisions in the indenture may not protect you from certain important corporate events, such as a leveraged
recapitalization (which would increase the level of our indebtedness), reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction. Such a transaction
may not involve a change in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if it does, may not involve a change that constitutes a "Change of Control" as
defined in the indenture that would trigger our obligation to repurchase the notes. If an event occurs that does not constitute a "Change of Control"

S-22


-----

as defined in the indenture, we will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes and you may be required to continue to hold your notes despite
the event. See "Description of Certain Indebtedness" and "Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control."

**You may not be able to determine when a change of control has occurred and may not be able to require us to purchase the notes as a result of a change**
**in the composition of the directors on our board of directors.**

Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a change of control and the provisions of the indenture may allow us to enter into transactions, such as
acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a change of control but may increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise
affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the notes. The definition of change of control includes a phrase relating to the transfer of "all or
substantially all" of the assets of us and our subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially
all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, your ability to require us to repurchase notes as a result of a
transfer of less than all of our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**Although the notes are referred to as "senior" notes, your right to receive payments on these notes is effectively subordinated to the rights of our**
**existing and future secured creditors. Further, the guarantees of these notes are effectively subordinated to all the guarantors' existing and future**
**secured indebtedness.**

Holders of our secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of the guarantors will have claims that are prior to your claims as holders of the notes
to the extent of the value of the assets securing that other indebtedness. Notably, we and certain of our subsidiaries, including the guarantors, are parties to
our credit agreement, which is secured by liens on substantially all of our and the guarantors' assets, other than our and the guarantors' real property. The
notes will be effectively subordinated to all of that secured indebtedness. In the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure,
dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of secured indebtedness will have prior claim to those assets
that constitute their collateral. Holders of the notes will participate ratably with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same
class as the notes, such as the 2025 notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or
creditor, in our remaining assets. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes. As a
result, holders of the notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness.

As of June 29, 2019, on an adjusted basis after giving effect to the completion of this offering, the new term loan borrowings under our senior secured
credit facility and the use of proceeds therefrom, the aggregate amount of our secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries would
have been $1.83 billion, and approximately $670.7 million would have been available for new term loan borrowing under the revolving credit facility under
our credit agreement (net of $1.6 million reserved for issued and outstanding letters of credit). We will be permitted to borrow substantial additional
indebtedness, including additional secured debt, in the future under the terms of the indenture. See "Description of Certain Indebtedness—Senior Secured
Credit Agreement."

**The notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our existing or future subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes.**

You will not have any claim as a creditor against any of our existing or future subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes. Indebtedness and other
liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will be effectively senior to your claims against those

S-23


-----

subsidiaries. Our three foreign subsidiaries, B&G Foods Canada, ULC, B&G Foods Manufacturing Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Sirops Maple Grove Inc.,
will not be guarantors of the notes, and any future foreign or partially-owned domestic subsidiaries will not be guarantors of the notes. As of June 29, 2019,
the total assets and total liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries were approximately $123.9 million and $25.3 million, respectively, and, for the two
quarters ended June 29, 2019, our non-guarantor subsidiaries generated approximately $101.6 million and $2.5 million of our net sales and net income,
respectively.

In addition, the indenture governing the notes will, subject to certain limitations, permit these subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and will not
contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. Any such indebtedness will be
effectively senior in right of payment to the notes.

**United States Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court to void the notes and the guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any**
**payments on the notes or the guarantees.**

The issuance of the notes and the guarantees may be subject to review under U.S. federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes. While the
relevant laws may vary from state to state, under such laws the payment of consideration will generally be a fraudulent conveyance if (1) we paid the
consideration with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (2) we or any of our guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee and, in the case of (2) only, one of the following is also true:

     - we or any of our guarantors were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of the indebtedness;

     - payment of the consideration left us or any of our guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on its business; or

     - we or any of our guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond our or its ability to pay those debts as they mature.

We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time. If a court
were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such
guarantee or subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or such guarantor, or require the holders of the
notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not
receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default under our credit agreement that could result in
acceleration of such indebtedness.

Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if at the time it incurred indebtedness:

     - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;

     - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts
and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or

     - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

If the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only
indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. A court could

S-24


-----

thus void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor's other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the
notes.

Each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the guarantor's liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the
incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the subsidiary guarantees from being
voided under fraudulent transfer laws.

**You may find it difficult to sell your notes.**

You may find it difficult to sell your notes because an active trading market for the notes may not develop. The notes are a new issue of securities for
which there currently is no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for listing or quotation of the notes on any securities exchange. Therefore,
we do not know the extent to which investor interest will lead to the development of a trading market or how liquid that market might be. Although certain of
the underwriters have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes, they are not obligated to do so. Accordingly, any market-making
activities with respect to the notes may be discontinued at any time without notice.

If a market for the notes does develop, it is possible that you will not be able to sell your notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when
you sell will be unfavorable. It is also possible that any trading market that does develop for the notes will not be liquid. Future trading prices of the notes
will depend on many factors, including:

     - our operating performance, financial condition and prospects, or the operating performance, financial condition and prospects of companies in
our industry generally;

     - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes;

     - prevailing interest rates; and

     - the market for similar securities.

**The market price for the notes may be volatile.**

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused volatility in prices. If a market for the notes
develops, it is possible that the market for the notes will be subject to disruptions and price volatility. Any disruptions may adversely affect the value of your
notes regardless of our operating performance, financial condition and prospects.

**Our credit ratings may not reflect all risks associated with an investment in the notes.**

Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our results of operations, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for
our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure,
market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include
maintaining, upgrading, or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of the
notes or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of financing, limit our access to the capital markets and
have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, including the notes offered hereby.

S-25


-----

**Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.**

Borrowings under our credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As such, our results of operations are sensitive to
movements in interest rates. There are many economic factors outside our control that have in the past and may, in the future, impact rates of interest
including publicly announced indices that underlie the interest obligations related to a certain portion of our debt. Factors that impact interest rates include
governmental monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and
foreign financial markets. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount
borrowed remained the same, and our results of operations would be adversely impacted. Such increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect
on our financial conditions and results of operations.

**We could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if there are changes in tax laws or taxing authorities do not agree with our interpretation**
**of applicable tax laws, including if we are required to establish or adjust valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.**

Tax laws and income tax rates are subject to change due to economic and political conditions. Our tax liabilities are based, in part, on our corporate
structure, interpretations of various U.S. and foreign tax laws, including withholding tax, application of changes in tax law to our operations and other
relevant laws of applicable taxing jurisdictions. From time to time, taxing authorities may conduct examinations of our income tax returns and other
regulatory filings. We cannot assure you that the taxing authorities will agree with our interpretations. If they do not agree, we may seek to enter into
settlements with the taxing authorities. We may also appeal a taxing authority's determination to the appropriate governmental authorities, but we cannot be
sure we will prevail. If we do not prevail or if we enter into settlements with taxing authorities, we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record
charges (or reduce tax assets) that adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We monitor on an ongoing basis our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and whether there is a need for a related valuation allowance. In evaluating
our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including
scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations.

**The ultimate impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our reported results in fiscal 2019 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided, possibly**
**materially.**

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which we refer to as the "U.S. Tax Act." The changes in the U.S. Tax
Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the U.S. Tax Act may have on our business and financial results. The U.S. Tax Act
contains provisions with separate effective dates but is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Under FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, we were required to revalue any deferred tax assets or liabilities in the period of enactment of change
in tax rates. The U.S. Tax Act lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The U.S. Tax Act also limits the deduction for net interest
expense incurred by a corporate taxpayer to 30% of the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income. Although we currently expect that our interest expense may
exceed 30% of our adjusted taxable income, at this time we do not believe this limitation will have a material adverse impact on our business or financial
results because any interest that is non-deductible may be carried forward indefinitely.

The ultimate impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our reported results in fiscal 2019 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided, possibly materially,
due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and other actions we may take as a result
of the U.S. Tax Act different from that currently contemplated.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $443.9 million. "Net proceeds" is what we expect to receive after paying the
underwriting discounts and other expenses of this offering, including legal, accounting and printing fees.

We intend to use the proceeds from this offering, together with the proceeds of the new term loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, to
(1) redeem all of the outstanding 2021 notes, (2) repay certain borrowings under our revolving credit facility and (3) pay related fees and expenses. Prior to
the redemption of the 2021 notes, we plan to use the proceeds from the offering to (1) repay certain borrowings under our revolving credit facility and pay
related fees and expenses and (2) invest the remainder in short-term investments, including cash, cash equivalents and/or marketable securities.

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters will receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. See "Underwriting—Other Relationships."

7 During fiscal 2017, we recorded a $1.6 million pre-tax loss as we sold to a third-party co-packer our Le Sueur, Minnesota research
center, including the seed technology assets, property, plant and equipment. During fiscal 2018, we recognized a pre-tax gain on the
Pirate Brands sale of $176.4 million.

8 Impairment of intangible assets for fiscal 2014 includes a $26.8 million loss for the impairment of amortizable trademarks and a
$7.4 million loss for the impairment of customer relationship intangibles, both relating to Rickland Orchards. Impairment of
intangible assets for fiscal 2016 includes a $4.5 million loss for the impairment of amortizable trademarks and a $0.9 million loss for
the impairment of customer relationship intangibles, both relating to Rickland Orchards.

9 In addition to the base purchase price consideration paid at closing, the acquisition agreement for Rickland Orchards required that we
pay additional purchase price earn-out consideration contingent upon the achievement of revenue growth targets for fiscal 2014, 2015
and 2016. At the time of acquisition, we established the fair value of the contingent consideration using revenue growth targets meant
to achieve operating results in excess of base purchase price acquisition model assumptions. As required, at June 28, 2014 we
remeasured the fair value of the contingent consideration using actual operating results through June 28, 2014 and revised forecasted
operating results for the remainder of fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, and reduced the probability of achievement and the fair value of the
contingent consideration to zero. This resulted in a non-cash gain of $8.2 million that is included in gain on change in fair value of
contingent consideration in fiscal 2014.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS**

**_Senior Secured Credit Agreement_**

We have a senior secured credit agreement that includes a revolving credit facility and the capacity to incur tranche A term loans and tranche B term
loans. As of June 29, 2019, $215 million of revolving loans and no borrowings under term loans were outstanding under our credit agreement. We intend to
use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering and the new term loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facility to redeem all of the outstanding
2021 notes, repay a portion of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility and pay related fees and expenses.

As of June 29, 2019, the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit of $1.6 million, was
$483.4 million. Proceeds of the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of targets in the same or a similar
line of business as our company, subject to specified criteria. We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the unused portion of the
revolving credit facility. The maximum letter of credit capacity under the revolving credit facility is $50.0 million, with a fronting fee of 0.25% per annum of
the drawable amount under all outstanding letters of credit and a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for revolving loans that are Eurodollar
(LIBOR) loans. The revolving credit facility matures on November 21, 2022.

We may permanently reduce the revolving credit facility commitment under the credit agreement at any time without premium or penalty (other than
customary "breakage" costs with respect to the early termination of LIBOR loans). Subject to certain exceptions, the credit agreement provides for mandatory
prepayment upon certain asset dispositions or casualty events and certain incurrence of indebtedness.

Interest under the revolving credit facility, including any outstanding letters of credit is determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in
accordance with the credit agreement, including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, and LIBOR plus an
applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%, in each case depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of June 29, 2019, the revolving credit facility
interest rate was approximately 5.3%.

In connection with this offering, we intend to incur an additional $450 million in tranche B term loans. We expect that the tranche B term loans will
mature seven years from incurrence. Interest under the tranche B term loans will be determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in accordance
with the credit agreement, including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin to be determined and LIBOR plus an applicable margin to be
determined.

Our obligations under the credit agreement are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by all of our existing and
certain future domestic subsidiaries. The credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries' assets except our and our
domestic subsidiaries' real property. The credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants, subject to certain permitted amounts and exceptions,
including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and make other restricted payments, repurchase shares of our
outstanding stock and create certain liens.

The credit agreement also contains certain financial maintenance covenants, which, among other things, specify a maximum consolidated leverage ratio
and a minimum interest coverage ratio, each ratio as defined in the credit agreement. Our consolidated leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of our consolidated
net debt, as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to our adjusted EBITDA for such period), may not exceed 7.00 to 1.00. We are also
required to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of
June 29, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, including the financial covenants, in the credit agreement.

S-37


-----

The credit agreement also provides for an incremental term loan and revolving loan facility, pursuant to which we may request that the lenders under the
credit agreement, and potentially other lenders, provide unlimited additional amounts of term loans or revolving loans or both on terms substantially
consistent with those provided under the credit agreement. Among other things, the utilization of the incremental facility is conditioned on our ability to
meet a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 4.00 to 1.00, the financial maintenance covenants described above and a sufficient number of lenders or
new lenders agreeing to participate in the facility.

**_4.625% Senior Notes due 2021_**

As of the date of this prospectus supplement, we have $700.0 million principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2021 outstanding. On September 10,
2019, we issued a conditional notice of redemption to the holders of our outstanding 2021 notes, notifying such holders that we intend to redeem all of the
outstanding 2021 notes on October 10, 2019. The redemption of the 2021 notes is conditioned upon the consummation of this offering and/or the new term
loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and our receipt of gross proceeds of not less than $700.0 million. We intend to use a portion of the
net proceeds from this offering and the new term loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facility to redeem all of the outstanding 2021 notes and pay
related fees and expenses. If this offering is completed, but new term loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are not incurred by the
redemption date, we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to
pay the redemption price of the 2021 notes. The redemption price of the 2021 notes is 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
redemption date. This prospectus supplement is not a notice to redeem the 2021 notes, and the completion of this offering is not conditioned upon
redemption of the 2021 notes.

**_5.25% Senior Notes due 2025_**

On April 3, 2017, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 at a price to the public of 100% of their face
value. On November 20, 2017, we issued an additional $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 notes at a price to the public 101% of their face
value plus accrued interest from October 1, 2017, which equates to a yield to worst of 5.03%. The notes issued in November 2017 were issued as additional
notes under the same indenture as our 2025 notes that were issued in April 2017, and, as such, form a single series and trade interchangeably with the
previously issued 2025 notes. Interest on the 2025 notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2025 notes will mature on April 1, 2025,
unless earlier retired or redeemed as permitted or required by the terms of the indenture governing the 2025 notes as described below.

Beginning April 1, 2020, we may redeem some or all of the 2025 notes at a redemption price of 103.9375% of their principal amount, and thereafter at
prices declining annually to 100% of their principal amount on or after April 1, 2023, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition,
if we undergo a change of control, we may be required to offer to repurchase the 2025 notes at the repurchase price of 101% of their principal amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.

We may also, from time to time, seek to retire 2025 notes through cash repurchases, exchanges of 2025 notes for equity securities, open market
purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including through the proceeds of this offering. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend
on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

Our obligations under the 2025 notes are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by all of our existing and
certain future domestic subsidiaries. The 2025

notes and the subsidiary guarantees are our and the guarantors' general unsecured obligations and are effectively junior in right of payment to all of our and
the guarantors' secured indebtedness and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries; are pari passu in right of payment to all
of our and the guarantors' existing and future unsecured senior debt (including the notes offered hereby); and are senior in right of payment to all of our and
the guarantors' future subordinated debt. Our foreign subsidiaries are not guarantors, and any future foreign or partially-owned domestic subsidiaries will not
be guarantors, of the 2025 notes.

The indenture governing the 2025 notes contains covenants with respect to us and the guarantors and restricts the incurrence of additional indebtedness
and the issuance of capital stock; the payment of dividends or distributions on, and redemption of, capital stock; a number of other restricted payments,
including certain investments; creation of specified liens, certain sale-leaseback transactions and sales of certain specified assets; fundamental changes,
including consolidation, mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets; and specified transactions with affiliates. Each of the covenants is
subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. As of June 29, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the covenants in the indenture
governing the 2025 notes.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading "Certain Definitions." In this description, the words "B&G
Foods" refers only to B&G Foods, Inc. and its successor in accordance with the terms of the indenture, and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

B&G Foods will issue the notes under an indenture, dated as of June 4, 2013 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture
establishing the form and terms of the notes (the "Tenth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "indenture") among itself, the
Guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. See "Notice to Investors." The terms of the notes will include those stated in the indenture and
those made part of the indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

This "Description of Notes," together with the "Description of Our Debt Securities" included in the accompanying base prospectus, is only a summary of
the material provisions of the indenture. It does not restate the indenture in its entirety. We urge you to read the indenture because it, and not this description,
defines your rights as a holder of the notes. A copy of the Base Indenture is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement that includes
the accompanying base prospectus. This "Description of Notes" supersedes the "Description of Debt Securities" in the accompanying base prospectus to the
extent it is inconsistent with such "Description of Debt Securities." Copies of the Base Indenture and the Tenth Supplemental Indenture are available as set
forth below under "—Additional Information." Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under "—Certain Definitions" have the
meanings assigned to them in the indenture.

The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the indenture.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The notes:

     - will be general unsecured obligations of B&G Foods;

     - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing (including the 2025 Senior Notes) and any future unsecured senior Indebtedness of
B&G Foods;

     - will be senior in right of payment to all existing and any future subordinated Indebtedness of B&G Foods; and

     - will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors.

However, the notes will be effectively subordinated to all borrowings under the Credit Agreement (including the new term loan borrowings and any
obligations under the revolving credit facility), which as of the date of the indenture are secured by substantially all of the assets of B&G Foods and the
Guarantors, other than the real estate of B&G Foods and the Guarantors. See "Risk Factors—Although the notes are referred to as "senior" notes, your right to
receive payments on these notes is effectively subordinated to the rights of our existing and future secured creditors. Further, the guarantees of these notes are
effectively subordinated to all the guarantors' existing and future secured indebtedness."

**_The Note Guarantees_**

The notes will be jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of B&G Foods' Domestic Subsidiaries.

S-40


-----

Each guarantee of the notes:

     - will be a general unsecured obligation of the Guarantor;

     - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing (including that Guarantor's guarantee of the 2025 Senior Notes) and any future
unsecured senior Indebtedness of that Guarantor; and

     - will be senior in right of payment to all existing and any future subordinated Indebtedness of that Guarantor.

Not all of our Subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to
us. The Guarantor Subsidiaries generated substantially all of our net sales for the 26 weeks ended June 29, 2019 and owned virtually all of our consolidated
assets as of June 29, 2019. As of the date of the indenture, our non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will be B&G Foods Canada, ULC, B&G Foods Manufacturing
Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Sirops Maple Grove Inc.

As of the date of the indenture, all of our Subsidiaries will be "Restricted Subsidiaries." However, under the circumstances described below under the
caption "—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries," we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as
"Unrestricted Subsidiaries." Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not guarantee the notes and will not be subject to many of the restrictive covenants in the
indenture.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

B&G Foods will issue $       million in aggregate principal amount of notes in this offering. B&G Foods may issue additional notes under the
indenture ("Additional Notes") from time to time after this offering. Any issuance of Additional Notes is subject to all of the covenants in the indenture,
including the covenant described below under the caption "—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock." The notes
and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the indenture, including, without
limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided that if any additional notes subsequently issued are not fungible with any
notes previously issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional notes will have a separate CUSIP number. B&G Foods will issue notes in
denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The notes will mature on           , 2027.

Interest on the notes will accrue at the rate of    % per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on            and            ,
commencing on            , 2020. Interest on overdue principal and interest, if any, will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the then applicable interest
rate on the notes. B&G Foods will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding            and             .

Interest on the notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid or provided
for. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

If a holder of notes has given wire transfer instructions to B&G Foods, B&G Foods will pay, or cause to be paid, all principal, interest and premium, if
any, on that holder's notes in accordance with those instructions. All other payments on the notes will be made at the office or agency of the paying agent and
registrar within the City and State of New York unless B&G Foods elects to make interest payments by check mailed to the noteholders at their address set
forth in the register of holders.

S-41


-----

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The trustee will initially act as paying agent and registrar. B&G Foods may change the paying agent or registrar without prior notice to the holders of the
notes, and B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may act as paying agent or registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A holder may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the indenture. The registrar and the trustee may require a holder, among other things, to
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of notes and holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer.
B&G Foods will not be required to transfer or exchange any note selected for redemption. Also, B&G Foods will not be required to transfer or exchange any
note for a period of 15 days before a selection of notes to be redeemed.

**Note Guarantees**

The notes will be guaranteed by each of B&G Foods' current and future Domestic Subsidiaries. The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations
of the Guarantors and those obligations will be limited as necessary to prevent that Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under
applicable law. See "Risk Factors—United States Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court to void the notes and the guarantees, and, if that
occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes or the guarantees."

A Guarantor may not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such
Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person, other than (i) B&G Foods or another Guarantor or (ii) an affiliate of B&G Foods solely for the purpose of
reincorporating or reorganizing in the United States or any state thereof), unless:

(1)  immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(2)  either:

(a)  the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or
merger (if other than such Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under the indenture, its Note Guarantee pursuant to a
supplemental indenture satisfactory to the trustee; or

(b)  the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the "Asset Sale" provisions of the indenture.

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically released:

(1)  in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or
consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) B&G Foods or a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods, if
the sale or other disposition complies with the "Asset Sale" provisions of the indenture;

(2)  in connection with any sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of that Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after
giving effect to such transaction) B&G Foods or a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods, if the sale or other disposition complies with the "Asset Sale"
provisions of the indenture;

(3)  if B&G Foods designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the indenture;

S-42


-----

(4)  upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture as provided below under "—Legal Defeasance and
Covenant Defeasance" and "—Satisfaction and Discharge";

(5)  if such Guarantor no longer constitutes a Domestic Subsidiary; or

(6)  if it is determined in good faith by B&G Foods that a liquidation, dissolution or merger out of existence of such Guarantor is in the best
interests of B&G Foods and is not materially disadvantageous to the holders.

See "—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales."

**Optional Redemption**

Except as described below, the notes will not be redeemable at B&G Foods' option prior to           , 2022. At any time prior to            , 2022,
B&G Foods may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of notes issued under the indenture (including
Additional Notes, if any), upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to    % of the principal amount of the notes
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, (subject to the rights of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive
interest on the relevant interest payment date) in an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings of B&G Foods; provided
that:

(1)  at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of notes originally issued under the indenture (excluding notes held by B&G Foods and its
Subsidiaries) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and

(2)  the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to           , 2022, B&G Foods may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the notes, upon not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date.

On or after           , 2022, B&G Foods may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the notes upon not less than 30 nor more than
60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes
redeemed, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on      of the years indicated below, subject to the
rights of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date:

**Year** **Percentage**
2022 %
2023 %
2024 %
2025 and thereafter 100.000%

Any redemption or notice of any redemption may, at B&G Foods' discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited
to, completion of an Equity Offering, other offering or other corporate transaction or event. In addition, we may provide in any notice of redemption that
payment of the redemption price and the performance of our obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another person; provided,
_however, that B&G Foods shall remain obligated to pay the redemption price and perform its obligations with respect to such_

S-43


-----

redemption in the event such other person fails to do so. Notice of any redemption in respect of an Equity Offering may be given prior to completion thereof.

Unless B&G Foods defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the notes or portions thereof called for redemption on
the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption**

B&G Foods is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes. However, under certain circumstances,
B&G Foods may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the caption "—Repurchase at the Option of Holders." We may at any time and from
time to time purchase notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of notes will have the right to require B&G Foods to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the indenture. In the Change of
Control Offer (subject to the conditions required by applicable law, if any), B&G Foods will offer a Change of Control Payment in cash equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes repurchased to the date of purchase, subject to the
rights of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of
Control, B&G Foods will mail a notice to each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to
repurchase notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and described in such notice. Holders electing to have a note purchased
pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the note, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the
note completed, to the paying agent at the address specified in the notice of Change of Control Offer prior to the close of business on the third business day
prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.

Any Change of Control Offer will be made in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, if applicable, Regulation 14e-1
under the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder and all other applicable Federal and state securities laws in connection with the repurchase of notes
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant,
B&G Foods' compliance with those laws and regulations will not in and of itself cause a breach of its obligations under this covenant.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, B&G Foods will, to the extent lawful:

(1)  accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2)  deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or portions of notes properly
tendered; and

(3)  deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by B&G Foods.

The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such notes, and the trustee will
promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased

S-44


-----

portion of the notes surrendered, if any. B&G Foods will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the
Change of Control Payment Date.

The provisions described above that require B&G Foods to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or
not any other provisions of the indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the holders of the notes to require that B&G Foods repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar
transaction.

B&G Foods will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if

(1)  a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the
indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by B&G Foods and purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the
Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under the caption "—Optional
Redemption," unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if
a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The occurrence of the events constituting a Change of Control under the indenture could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement and
under B&G Foods' or its Subsidiaries' other Credit Facilities and debt instruments. The definition of "change of control" under the Credit Agreement is
substantially the same as that in the indenture. Following such an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders under the Credit Agreement or
such other Credit Facilities and debt instruments would have the right to require the immediate repayment of the Indebtedness thereunder in full, and might
have the right to require such repayment prior to the Change of Control Payment Date on which B&G Foods would be required to repurchase the notes.

No assurances can be given that B&G Foods will have funds available or otherwise will be able to purchase any notes upon the occurrence of a Change
of Control. The provisions of the indenture relating to a Change of Control in and of themselves may not afford holders of the notes protection in the event of
a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect holders of the notes if such
transaction is not the type of transaction included within the definition of a Change of Control. A transaction involving management or Affiliates of B&G
Foods likewise will result in a Change of Control only if it is the type of transaction specified by the definition. The existence of the foregoing provisions
relating to a Change of Control may or may not deter a third party from seeking to acquire us in a transaction which constitutes a Change of Control and may
or may not discourage or make more difficult the removal of incumbent management.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all or
substantially all" of the properties or assets of B&G Foods and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the
phrase "substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require
B&G Foods to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of B&G Foods and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

The provisions of the indenture related to B&G Foods' obligations to make a Change of Control Offer may be waived or modified with the written
consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding.

**Asset Sales**

B&G Foods will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1)  B&G Foods (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair
Market Value (measured as of the date of the definitive agreement with respect to such Asset Sale), as determined in good faith by B&G Foods, of the
assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2)  at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by B&G Foods or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash
Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(a)  any liabilities, as shown on B&G Foods' most recent consolidated balance sheet, of B&G Foods or any Restricted Subsidiary (other
than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the notes or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed by the
transferee of any such assets and B&G Foods or such Restricted Subsidiary is released from further liability;

(b)  any securities, notes or other obligations received by B&G Foods or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are
converted by B&G Foods or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days after such Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash received in
that conversion;

(c)  any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by B&G Foods or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an
aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at
that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $100.0 million or (ii) 3.0% of Total Assets, with the Fair Market Value of each item of
Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and with giving effect to subsequent changes in value; and

(d)  any stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (2) or (4) of the next paragraph of this covenant.

Any Asset Sale pursuant to a condemnation, appropriation or other similar taking, including by deed in lieu of condemnation, or pursuant to the
foreclosure or other enforcement of a Permitted Lien or exercise by the related lienholder of rights with respect to any of the foregoing, including by deed or
assignment in lieu of foreclosure, will not be required to satisfy the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph. Within 360 days after the receipt of any
Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, B&G Foods (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds, at its option:

(1)  to repay, prepay or purchase Indebtedness and other Obligations under a Credit Facility and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit
Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(2)  to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another Permitted Business, or to acquire any Capital Stock of another Permitted Business, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods;

(3)  to make a capital expenditure;

(4)  to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets under GAAP and that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or

(5)  any combination of the foregoing clauses (1) through (4).

S-46


-----

In the case of clauses (2) and (4) above, B&G Foods will be deemed to have complied with its obligations in the preceding paragraph if it enters into a
binding commitment to acquire such assets or Capital Stock prior to 360 days after the receipt of the applicable Net Proceeds; provided that such binding
commitment will be subject only to customary conditions and such acquisition is completed within 180 days following the expiration of the aforementioned
360 day period. If the acquisition contemplated by such binding commitment is not consummated on or before such 180th day, and B&G Foods has not
applied the applicable Net Proceeds for another purpose permitted by the preceding paragraph on or before such 180th day, such commitment shall be
deemed not to have been a permitted application of Net Proceeds. Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, B&G Foods may temporarily reduce
revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture.

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute "Excess
Proceeds." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $25.0 million, within 30 days thereof, B&G Foods will make an Asset Sale Offer to all
holders of notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the notes (containing provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with
respect to offers) to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of notes and
such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in
connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100%
of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of notes
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after
consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, B&G Foods may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture. If the aggregate
principal amount of notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or required to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer
exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the trustee will select the notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on
the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

Any Asset Sale Offer will be made in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, if applicable, Regulation 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and the rules thereunder and all other applicable Federal and state securities laws. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, B&G Foods' compliance with those laws and regulations will not in and of itself cause a breach of
its obligations under this covenant.

The agreements governing B&G Foods' other Indebtedness contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events
that would constitute an Asset Sale. The exercise by the holders of notes of their right to require B&G Foods to repurchase the notes upon an Asset Sale could
cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on B&G Foods. In the event
an Asset Sale occurs at a time when B&G Foods is prohibited from purchasing notes, B&G Foods could seek the consent of its senior lenders to purchase
notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If B&G Foods does not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, B&G
Foods will remain prohibited from purchasing notes. In that case, B&G Foods' failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under
the indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under the other indebtedness. Finally, B&G Foods' ability to pay cash to the holders of notes upon a
repurchase may be limited by B&G Foods' then existing financial resources.

S-47


-----

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed or purchased in an offer to purchase at any time, the trustee will select notes for redemption on a pro rata
basis (or, in the case of notes issued in global form as discussed under "—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form," based on a method that most nearly approximates
a pro rata selection as the trustee may deem appropriate) unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements.

No notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be transmitted at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption
date to each holder of notes to be redeemed at its address last shown upon the registry books of B&G Foods' registrar, except that redemption notices may be
mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the
indenture.

If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note will state the portion of the principal amount of that note that
is to be redeemed; provided that the principal amount specified must be $2,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A new note in principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued in the name of the holder of notes upon cancellation of the original note. Notes
called for redemption, unless such redemption is conditioned upon the happening of a future event, become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and
after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on notes or portions of notes called for redemption.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Restricted Payments_**

B&G Foods will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1)  declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of B&G Foods' or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries'
Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving B&G Foods or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of B&G Foods' or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests in their capacity as
such (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of B&G Foods and other than dividends or
distributions payable to B&G Foods or a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods);

(2)  purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection with any merger or consolidation

(3)  make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness of B&G Foods
or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated to the notes or to any Note Guarantee (excluding any intercompany Indebtedness between or
among B&G Foods and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), except a payment of interest or principal on, or the purchase, repurchase or other
acquisition of, such Indebtedness in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due
within one year of the date of such payment, purchase, repurchase or other acquisition; or

(4)  make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (4) being collectively referred to
as "Restricted Payments"), unless, at the time

S-48

of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence
of such Restricted Payment and:

(1)  if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for B&G Foods' four most recent fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available is not less than 1.6 to 1.0, such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by
B&G Foods and its Restricted Subsidiaries since the date of the indenture (except for Restricted Payments made pursuant to clauses (1) (so
long as such Restricted Payment was previously included for purposes of this calculation (to the extent required to be so included) at the time
of its declaration), (2), (3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11) or (12) of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of $150.0 million and,

or exchangeable Disqualified Stock or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of B&G Foods that have been converted into or
exchanged for such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of B&G
Foods); plus

(c)  100% of the Fair Market Value as of the date of issuance of any Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) issued since
June 4, 2013 by B&G Foods as consideration for the purchase by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of all or substantially
all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another Permitted Business (including by means of a merger, consolidation or
other business combination permitted under the indenture); plus

(d)  to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after June 3, 2014 is sold for cash or other property or otherwise
liquidated or repaid for cash, the lesser of (i) the cash return of capital with respect to such Restricted Investment or the Fair Market
Value of such other property (less the cost of disposition, if any) and (ii) the initial amount of such Restricted Investment; plus

(e)  to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods designated as such after June 4, 2013 is redesignated as a
Restricted Subsidiary after June 4, 2013 or merges or consolidates with or into, or is liquidated into, B&G Foods or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, the lesser of (i) the Fair Market Value of B&G Foods' Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation or
(ii) such Fair Market Value as of the date on which such Subsidiary was originally designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary after
June 4, 2013.

As of June 30, 2019, the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to this clause (1) was approximately $0.8 billion.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1)  the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any irrevocable redemption within 90 days after the date of declaration of the dividend
or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration or notice, the dividend or redemption payment would have
complied with the provisions of the indenture;

S-49


-----

(2)  the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds of the sale within 10 business days (other than to a
Subsidiary of B&G Foods) of, Equity Interests of B&G Foods (other than Disqualified Stock) or from the contribution of common equity capital to
B&G Foods within 10 business days; provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized for any such Restricted Payment will be
excluded from clause (1)(b) of the preceding paragraph;

(3)  the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness of B&G Foods or any Guarantor that is
contractually subordinated to the notes or to any Note Guarantee with the net cash proceeds from an incurrence of Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness or issuance of Disqualified Stock permitted to be issued by the covenant described below under the caption "—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" within 10 business days from such incurrence or issuance;

(4)  the payment of any dividend (or, in the case of any partnership or limited liability company, any similar distribution) by a Restricted
Subsidiary of B&G Foods to the holders of its Equity Interests on a pro rata basis;

(5)  so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing or would be caused thereby, the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or
retirement for value of any Equity Interests of B&G Foods or any Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods held by any current or former officer, director or
employee of B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any equity subscription agreement, stock option plan or any other
management or employee benefit plan or agreement, shareholders' agreement or similar agreement; provided that the aggregate price paid for all such
repurchased, redeemed, acquired or retired Equity Interests may not exceed $15.0 million in any calendar year (provided that B&G Foods may carry
over and make in a subsequent calendar year, in addition to the amounts permitted for such calendar year, up to $5.0 million of unutilized capacity
under this clause (5) attributable to the immediately preceding calendar year); provided, further, that such amount in any calendar year may be
increased by an amount not to exceed the cash proceeds received by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (to the extent contributed to
B&G Foods) from sales of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of B&G Foods to officers, directors or employees of B&G Foods or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries that occur after the date of the indenture (provided that the amount of such cash proceeds used for any such repurchase,
redemption, acquisition or retirement will not increase the amount available for Restricted Payments under clause (1)(b) of the preceding paragraph
and provided that B&G Foods may elect to apply all or any portion of the aggregate increase contemplated by this proviso in any calendar year);
_provided, further, that cancellation of Indebtedness owing to B&G Foods from members of management of B&G Foods or any Restricted Subsidiary_
in connection with a repurchase of Equity Interests of B&G Foods will not be deemed to constitute a Restricted Payment;

(6)  the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options to the extent such Equity Interests represent a portion
of the exercise price of those stock options;

(7)  so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing or would be caused thereby, the declaration and payment of regularly scheduled or
accrued dividends to holders of any class or series of Disqualified Stock of B&G Foods or any Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods issued on or after
the date of the indenture in accordance with the covenant described below under the caption "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
Stock";

(8)  so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing or would be caused thereby, upon the occurrence of an Asset Sale or a Change of
Control and within 60 days after the completion of the related Asset Sale Offer or Change of Control Offer, any purchase or redemption of
Indebtedness of B&G Foods or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated to the notes or to

S-50


-----

any Note Guarantee required pursuant to the terms thereof as a result of such Asset Sale or Change of Control at a purchase or redemption price not to
exceed 101% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any; provided, however, that such purchase or
redemption is not made, directly or indirectly, from the proceeds of (or made in anticipation of) any issuance of Indebtedness by B&G Foods or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(9)  payments of dividends to B&G Foods solely to enable it to make payments to holders of its Capital Stock in lieu of the issuance of fractional
shares of its Capital Stock;

(10) the acquisition of any shares of Disqualified Stock of B&G Foods in exchange for other shares of Disqualified Stock of B&G Foods or with
the net cash proceeds from an issuance of Disqualified Stock by B&G Foods within 10 business days of such issuance, in each case that is permitted to
be issued under the covenant described below under the caption "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock";

(11) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of the 2025 Senior Notes, including any call premium
paid in connection therewith; and

(12) so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing or would be caused thereby, other Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount at the
time outstanding not to exceed the greater of (i) $125.0 million or (ii) 4.0% of Total Assets.

For purposes of this covenant, the amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the Restricted
Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by B&G Foods or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the
Restricted Payment. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment meets the criteria of more than one of
the exceptions described in clauses (1) through (12) above or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, B&G Foods will be
permitted, in its sole discretion, to classify the Restricted Payment, or later reclassify the Restricted Payment, in any manner that complies with this covenant.

**_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock_**

B&G Foods will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise
become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, (collectively, "incur") with respect to any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and B&G
Foods will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however,
that B&G Foods may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock, and the Guarantors may incur Indebtedness (including
Acquired Debt) or issue preferred stock, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for B&G Foods' most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such
preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net
proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or the preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be,
at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Debt"):

(1)  the incurrence by B&G Foods and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness and letters of credit under Credit Facilities in an
aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) (with letters of credit being deemed to have a principal amount equal to
the maximum potential liability of B&G Foods and its Restricted Subsidiaries thereunder)

S-51


-----

not to exceed the greater of (x) $200.0 million and (y) the amount of the Borrowing Base as of the date of such incurrence;

(2)  the incurrence by B&G Foods and its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness;

(3)  the incurrence by B&G Foods and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the notes and the related Note Guarantees to be issued on
the date of the indenture;

(4)  the incurrence by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage
financings or purchase money obligations, in each case incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of design,
construction, installation or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
(whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Equity Interests of any Person owning such assets), in an aggregate principal amount, including
all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this
clause (4), not to exceed the greater of (i) 4.0% of Total Assets or (ii) $125.0 million at any time outstanding;

(5)  the incurrence by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net
proceeds of which are used to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness or the
2025 Senior Notes) that was permitted by the indenture to be incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (16) or
(17) of this paragraph;

(6)  the incurrence by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or among B&G Foods and any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that:

(a)  if B&G Foods or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee is not B&G Foods or a Guarantor, such
Indebtedness must be expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations then due with respect to the notes, in the
case of B&G Foods, or the Note Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor; and

(b)  (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than
B&G Foods or a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either
B&G Foods or a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods, will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by B&G
Foods or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (6);

(7)  the issuance by any of B&G Foods' Restricted Subsidiaries to B&G Foods or to any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of shares of preferred stock;
_provided, however, that:_

(a)  any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such preferred stock being held by a Person other than B&G
Foods or a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods; and

(b)  any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person that is not either B&G Foods or a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G
Foods, will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance of such preferred stock by such Restricted Subsidiary that was not permitted by
this clause (7);

(8)  the incurrence by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations in the ordinary course of business;

S-52


-----

(9)  the guarantee by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness of B&G Foods or a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods
that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari
_passu with the notes, then the Guarantee shall be subordinated or pari passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed;_

(10) the incurrence by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness in respect of bankers' acceptances, performance, bid and
surety bonds and completion guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business;

(11) the incurrence by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial
institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business;

(12) the incurrence of Indebtedness arising from agreements of B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries providing for indemnification,
adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations, in each case, incurred in connection with the disposition of any business, assets or a Restricted
Subsidiary, other than the Guarantees of Indebtedness incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such business, assets or a Restricted
Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition; provided, however, that the maximum assumable liability in respect of all such Indebtedness
shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds including non-cash proceeds (the Fair Market Value of such non-cash proceeds being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value) actually received by B&G Foods and Restricted Subsidiaries in connection
with such disposition;

(13) the incurrence of Indebtedness owed to any Person in connection with worker's compensation, self-insurance, health, disability or other
employee benefits or property, casualty or liability insurance provided by such Person to B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, pursuant to
reimbursement or indemnification obligations to such Person, in each case incurred in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practices;

(14) pledges, deposits or payments made or given in the ordinary course of business in connection with or to secure statutory, regulatory or
similar obligations, including obligations under health, safety or environmental obligations, or arising from guarantees to suppliers, lessors, licenses,
contractors, franchisees or customers of obligations, other than Indebtedness, made in the ordinary course of business;

(15) the incurrence of Indebtedness by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries issued to directors, officers or employees of B&G Foods or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with the redemption or purchase of Capital Stock that, by its terms, is subordinated to the notes, is not
secured by any assets of B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and does not require cash payments prior to the Stated Maturity of the notes,
in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $5.0 million;

(16) the incurrence of Indebtedness by B&G Foods or any Restricted Subsidiary to finance the acquisition (including, without limitation, by way
of a merger) of Capital Stock of any Person engaged in, or assets used or useful in, a Permitted Business; provided that the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio for B&G Foods' most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date
on which such Indebtedness is incurred would have been at least 1.75 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the
net proceeds therefrom), as if the Indebtedness had been incurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period; and

(17) the incurrence by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted
value, as applicable) at any time

S-53


-----

outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness
incurred pursuant to this clause (17), not to exceed the greater of (i) 4.0% of Total Assets or (ii) $125.0 million.

B&G Foods will not incur, and will not permit any Guarantor to incur, any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in
right of payment to any other Indebtedness of B&G Foods or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment
to the notes and the applicable Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of B&G Foods solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a first or
junior priority basis.

For purposes of determining compliance with this "Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" covenant, in the event that an item of
proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (17) above, or is entitled to be
incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, B&G Foods will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or
later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant. Indebtedness under Credit Facilities outstanding
on the date on which notes are first issued and authenticated under the indenture will initially be deemed Existing Indebtedness. The accrual of interest, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock in the
form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock
for purposes of this covenant. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that B&G Foods or any Restricted
Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(1)  the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount;

(2)  the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(3)  in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of:

(a)  the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(b)  the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.

**_Liens_**

B&G Foods will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind (other than
Permitted Liens) to secure Indebtedness of any kind on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, unless all payments due under the indenture and the notes
are secured on an equal and ratable basis with the obligations so secured (or, if such obligations are subordinated by their terms to the notes or the Note
Guarantees, prior to the obligations so secured) until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the notes pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Lien that gave rise to the obligation to so secure the notes
or the Note Guarantees.

S-54

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

B&G Foods will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any
consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1)  pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, or with respect to any
other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed to B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2)  make loans or advances to B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(3)  transfer any of its properties or assets to B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(1)  agreements governing Existing Indebtedness and any other agreement, including the Credit Agreement and the 2025 Senior Notes Indenture,
as in effect on the date of the indenture and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements
or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than
those contained in those agreements on the date of the indenture;

(2)  the indenture, the notes and the Note Guarantees;

(3)  applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

(4)  any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect
at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness or Capital Stock was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such
acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the
property or assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the indenture
to be incurred;

(5)  customary non-assignment provisions in contracts, licenses and other commercial agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(6)  purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business and Capital Lease Obligations that impose restrictions
on the property purchased or leased of the nature described in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;

(7)  any agreement for the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock or assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts
distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(8)  Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the encumbrances or restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness are, in the good faith judgment of the senior management or Board of Directors of B&G Foods, not materially more
restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

(9)  any restriction on the transfer of assets under any Lien permitted under the indenture imposed by the holder of the Lien;

S-55


-----

(10) provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback
agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or with the approval of B&G Foods'
Board of Directors, which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements;

(11) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(12) any other agreement governing Indebtedness incurred after the date of the indenture that contains encumbrances or other restrictions that are,
in the good faith judgment of B&G Foods, no more restrictive in any material respect taken as a whole than those encumbrances and other restrictions
that are customary in comparable financings.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

B&G Foods will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not B&G Foods is the surviving entity); or
(2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets (such amounts to be computed on a consolidated
basis) of B&G Foods and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(1)  either: (a) B&G Foods is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than
B&G Foods) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made is either (i) a corporation organized or
existing under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia or (ii) a partnership or limited liability company
organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia that has at least one Restricted
Subsidiary that is a corporation organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia,
which corporation becomes the co-issuer of the notes pursuant to a supplemental indenture reasonably satisfactory to the trustee;

(2)  the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than B&G Foods) or the Person to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made assumes all the obligations of B&G Foods under the notes and the indenture pursuant to
agreements reasonably satisfactory to the trustee;

(3)  immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(4)  B&G Foods or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than B&G Foods), or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and
any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either:

(a)  be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first

(b)  have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio that is equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of B&G Foods immediately
prior to such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition.

In addition, B&G Foods will not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of the properties and assets of it and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, in one or more related

transactions, to any other Person, other than in compliance with this "Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets" covenant.

This "Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets" covenant will not apply to:

(1)  a merger of B&G Foods with an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating B&G Foods in another jurisdiction; or

(2)  any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets between or among B&G Foods
and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

B&G Foods will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, on or after the date of the indenture, make any payment to, or sell, lease,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction,
contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of B&G Foods (each, an "Affiliate Transaction")
involving aggregate consideration in excess of $5.0 million, unless:

(1)  the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to B&G Foods or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that
would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by B&G Foods or such Restricted Subsidiary with a Person that is not an Affiliate of B&G
Foods; and

(2)  B&G Foods delivers to the trustee:

(a)  with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of
$25.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of B&G Foods set forth in an Officers' Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction
complies with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of
Directors of B&G Foods or, if none, a disinterested representative appointed by the Board of Directors for such purpose; and

(b)  with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of
$50.0 million, an opinion as to the fairness to B&G Foods or such Subsidiary of such Affiliate Transaction from a financial point of view or
that such Affiliate Transaction is not less favorable to B&G Foods and its Restricted Subsidiaries than could reasonably be expected to be
obtained in a comparable transaction with a Person that is not an Affiliate of B&G Foods, as issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment
banking firm of national standing.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1)  any employment agreement, officer or director indemnification agreement or any similar arrangement entered into by B&G Foods or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and payments pursuant thereto;

(2)  transactions between or among B&G Foods and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(3)  transactions with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods) that is an Affiliate of B&G Foods solely because B&G
Foods owns, directly or through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person;

S-57


-----

(4)  fees and compensation paid to officers and employees of B&G Foods or any Restricted Subsidiaries, to the extent such fees and
compensation are reasonable and customary, and payment of reasonable directors' fees to Persons who are not otherwise Affiliates of B&G Foods;

(5)  any issuance or sale of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of B&G Foods to Affiliates, employees, officers and directors of B&G
Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(6)  Restricted Payments that are permitted by the provisions of the indenture described above under the caption "—Restricted Payments";

(7)  maintenance in the ordinary course of business of customary benefit programs or arrangements for employees, officers or directors, including
vacation plans, health and life insurance plans, deferred compensation plans and retirement or savings plans and similar plans;

(8)  loans or advances to employees that are permitted by the provisions of the indenture under the definition of "Permitted Investments";

(9)  any agreement as in effect and entered into as of the date of the indenture, or any amendment thereto or any transaction contemplated thereby
(including pursuant to any amendment thereto) in any replacement agreement thereto so long as any such amendment or replacement agreement is not
more disadvantageous to the holders of the notes in any material respect than the original agreement as in effect on the date of the indenture;

(10) any transaction or series of transactions between B&G Foods or any Restricted Subsidiary and any of their Joint Ventures; provided that
(a) such transaction or series of transactions is in the ordinary course of business between B&G Foods or such Restricted Subsidiary and such Joint
Venture and (b) with respect to any such Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate consideration in excess of $25.0 million, such Affiliate
Transaction complies with clause (1) of the preceding paragraph and such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of B&G
Foods; and

(11) any service, purchase, lease, supply or similar agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business between B&G Foods or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate that is a customer, client, supplier or purchaser or seller of goods or services, so long as the senior management
or Board of Directors of B&G Foods determines in good faith that any such agreement is on terms not materially less favorable to B&G Foods or such
Restricted Subsidiary than those that could be obtained in a comparable arms'-length transaction with an entity that is not an Affiliate.

**_Business Activities_**

B&G Foods will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other than Permitted Businesses, except to such
extent as would not be material to B&G Foods and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of B&G Foods.

**_Additional Note Guarantees_**

If B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries acquires or creates another Domestic Subsidiary after the date of the indenture, then that newly
acquired or created Domestic Subsidiary will become a Guarantor and execute a supplemental indenture and deliver an opinion of counsel (subject to
customary assumptions and exceptions) satisfactory to the trustee within 10 business days of the date on which it was acquired or created; provided that any
Domestic Subsidiary that constitutes an Immaterial Subsidiary need not become a Guarantor until such time as it ceases to be an Immaterial Subsidiary.

S-58


-----

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of B&G Foods may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a
Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by B&G
Foods and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as Unrestricted will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation
and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption "—Restricted Payments" or under the
definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by B&G Foods. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time
and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors of B&G Foods may redesignate any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of B&G Foods as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the trustee by filing with the trustee a certified copy of
a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officers' Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the
preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption "—Restricted Payments." If, at any time, any Unrestricted
Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes
of the indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods as of such date and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Preferred Stock," B&G Foods will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of B&G Foods may at any time designate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of B&G Foods; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted
Subsidiary of B&G Foods of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such
Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," calculated on a pro
forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would result
following such designation.

**_Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions_**

B&G Foods will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into any sale and leaseback transaction; provided that B&G Foods or
any Guarantor may enter into a sale and leaseback transaction if:

(1)  B&G Foods or that Guarantor, as applicable, could have (a) incurred Indebtedness in an amount equal to the Attributable Debt relating to
such sale and leaseback transaction under the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the
caption "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" and

(a)  incurred a Lien to secure such Indebtedness pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption "—Liens";

(2)  the gross cash proceeds of that sale and leaseback transaction are at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the property that is the subject of
that sale and leaseback transaction; and

(3)  the transfer of assets in that sale and leaseback transaction is permitted by, and B&G Foods applies the proceeds of such transaction in
compliance with, the covenant described above under the caption "—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales."

**_Effectiveness of Covenants_**

If after the date of the indenture, (1) the notes have an Investment Grade Rating from two of the Rating Agencies and (2) no Default has occurred and is
continuing under this Indenture, then, B&G Foods and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the
following headings (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants" and such date shall be the "Suspension Date"):

     - "—Change of Control," "—Asset Sales," "—Restricted Payments,"

     - "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,"

     - Clause (4) of the first paragraph of "—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets," "—Transactions with Affiliates," and "—Dividend and other
Payment Restrictions affecting Restricted Subsidiaries."

If at any time the notes' credit rating is downgraded from an Investment Grade Rating by any Rating Agency, then the Suspended Covenants will
thereafter be reinstated with respect to future events (the "Reinstatement Date"), unless and until the notes subsequently attain an Investment Grade Rating
from two of the Ratings Agencies and no Default or Event of Default is in existence (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for
such time that the notes maintain an Investment Grade Rating from two of the Ratings Agencies and no Default or Event of Default is in existence); provided,
_however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the notes or the Guarantees with respect to the_
Suspended Covenants based on, and none of B&G Foods or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during
the Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reinstatement Date,
regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The
period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reinstatement Date is referred to as the "Suspension Period." B&G Foods will notify
the trustee of the commencement or termination of any Suspension Period.

In the event of any reinstatement, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been Incurred pursuant to clause (2)
of the second paragraph of "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" and all Restricted Payments made after such reinstatement will be
calculated as though the limitations contained in "—Restricted Payments" had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period.

For purposes of the "—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries" covenant, on the Reinstatement Date, any consensual
encumbrances or restrictions of the type specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) of that covenant entered into during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have
been in effect on the date of the Indenture, so that they are permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under "—Dividend and Other Payment
Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries."

For purposes of the "Transactions with Affiliates" covenant, any Affiliate Transaction (as defined below) entered into after the Reinstatement Date
pursuant to a contract, agreement, loan, advance or guaranty with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer entered into during the Suspension Period
will be deemed to have been in effect as of the date of the Indenture for purposes of clause (6) under "—Transactions with Affiliates."

During any period when the Suspended Covenants are suspended, the Board of Directors of the Issuer may not designate any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries
as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture.

There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

S-60


-----

**_Payments for Consent_**

B&G Foods will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the
benefit of any holder of notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the indenture or the notes
unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the
solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.

**_Reports_**

Whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, so long as any notes are outstanding, B&G Foods will furnish to the holders of notes or
cause the trustee to furnish to the holders of notes, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations:

(1)  all quarterly and annual reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if B&G Foods were required to file
such reports; and

(2)  all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if B&G Foods were required to file such reports; provided,
_however, that the availability of the foregoing materials on the SEC's EDGAR service or on B&G Foods' website shall be deemed to satisfy B&G_
Foods' delivery obligations hereunder.

All such reports will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with all of the rules and regulations applicable to such reports. Each annual report
on Form 10-K will include a report on B&G Foods' consolidated financial statements by B&G Foods' independent registered public accounting firm. In
addition, B&G Foods will file a copy of each of the reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above with the SEC for public availability within the time periods
specified in the rules and regulations applicable to such reports (unless the SEC will not accept such a filing) and will make such information available to
securities analysts and prospective investors upon request.

If at any time B&G Foods is no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for any reason, B&G Foods will nevertheless
continue filing the reports specified in the preceding paragraphs of this covenant with the SEC within the time periods specified above unless the SEC will
not accept such a filing. B&G Foods will not take any action for the purpose of causing the SEC not to accept any such filings. If, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the SEC will not accept B&G Foods' filings for any reason, B&G Foods will post the reports referred to in the preceding paragraphs on its website
within the time periods that would apply if B&G Foods were required to file those reports with the SEC.

If B&G Foods has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the
preceding paragraphs will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of the financial condition and results of operations of B&G Foods
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of B&G Foods.

In addition, B&G Foods and the Guarantors agree that, for so long as any notes remain outstanding, if at any time they are not required to file the reports
required by the preceding paragraphs, they will furnish to the holders of notes and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

S-61

**_Events of Default and Remedies_**

Each of the following will be an "Event of Default" under the indenture:

(1)  default for 30 consecutive days in the payment when due of interest on the notes;

(2)  default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the principal of, or premium, if any, on, the notes;

(3)  failure by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days after written notice to B&G Foods by the trustee or the holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding voting as a single class to comply with any of the agreements in the indenture;

(4)  default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any
Indebtedness for money borrowed by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by B&G Foods or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of the indenture, if that default:

(a)  is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace
period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "Payment Default"); or

(b)  results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which
there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $20.0 million or more;

(5)  failure by B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction
aggregating in excess of $20.0 million (net of any amount covered by insurance from an insurer that has not denied liability therefor), which
judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after their entry;

(6)  except as permitted by the indenture, any Note Guarantee is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any
reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its
Note Guarantee; and

(7)  certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the indenture with respect to B&G Foods or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is
a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to B&G Foods, any Restricted Subsidiary of B&G
Foods that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries of B&G Foods that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary,
all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the
trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable
immediately.

Holders of the notes may not enforce the indenture or the notes except as provided in the indenture. Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes may direct the trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The trustee may withhold from holders
of the notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it

S-62


-----

determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or premium, if any.

Subject to the provisions of the indenture relating to the duties of the trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will be
under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the indenture at the request or direction of any holders of notes unless such holders have
offered to the trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any, when due, no holder of a note may pursue any remedy
with respect to the indenture or the notes unless:

(1)  such holder has previously given the trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2)  holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes have requested the trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3)  such holders have offered the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4)  the trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5)  holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes have not given the trustee a direction inconsistent with
such request within such 60-day period.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes by notice to the trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the
notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the indenture except a continuing Default or
Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium, if any, on, or the principal of, the notes. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4)
above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the notes) shall
be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the trustee or the holders, if within 30 days (or such longer period as may be
provided for cure of the default in the agreement under which such default may arise) after such Event of Default arose:

(1)  the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged;

(2)  holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3)  the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

B&G Foods is required to deliver to the trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or
Event of Default, B&G Foods is required to deliver to the trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Affiliates and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, direct or indirect incorporator, Affiliate, stockholder or controlling Person, of B&G Foods or any
Guarantor, as such, or any successor entity, will have any liability for any obligations of B&G Foods or the Guarantors under the notes, the indenture, the
Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of notes by accepting a note waives
and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the federal securities laws.

S-63


-----

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

B&G Foods may at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding notes and all obligations of
the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees ("Legal Defeasance"). If Legal Defeasance occurs, B&G Foods and the Guarantors will be
deemed to have paid and discharged all amounts owed under the notes and the Note Guarantees, and the indenture will cease to be of further effect as to the
notes and Note Guarantees, except for:

(1)  the rights of holders of outstanding notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, such notes
when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(2)  B&G Foods' obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3)  the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee, and B&G Foods' and the Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith; and

(4)  the Legal Defeasance provisions of the indenture.

In addition, B&G Foods may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of B&G Foods and the Guarantors released with respect to
certain covenants (including its obligation to make Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the indenture ("Covenant
_Defeasance") and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the notes. In the_
event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events) described
under "—Events of Default and Remedies" will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1)  B&G Foods must irrevocably deposit with the trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable
Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable Government Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the
opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or independent registered public accounting firm, to pay the principal of, or
interest and premium, if any, on, the outstanding notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may
be, and B&G Foods must specify whether the notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;

(2)  in the case of Legal Defeasance, B&G Foods must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel (subject to customary assumptions and
exceptions) reasonably acceptable to the trustee confirming that (a) B&G Foods has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal
Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date of the indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the
effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel (subject to customary assumptions and exceptions) will confirm that, the holders of the
outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to
federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
occurred;

(3)  in the case of Covenant Defeasance, B&G Foods must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel (subject to customary assumptions and
exceptions) reasonably acceptable to the trustee confirming that the holders of the outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for

S-64


-----

federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4)  no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting
from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness, and in each case
the granting of Liens in connection therewith) and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other
material instrument to which B&G Foods or any Guarantor is a party or by which B&G Foods or any Guarantor is bound;

(5)  such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material
agreement or instrument (other than the indenture and agreements governing other Indebtedness being defeased, discharged or replaced) to which
B&G Foods or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which B&G Foods or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;

(6)  B&G Foods must deliver to the trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by B&G Foods with the intent of
preferring the holders of notes over the other creditors of B&G Foods with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of
B&G Foods or others; and

(7)  B&G Foods must deliver to the trustee an Officers' Certificate and an opinion of counsel (subject to customary assumptions and exceptions),
each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the indenture or the notes or the Note Guarantees may be amended, modified or supplemented
with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, notes), and any past or existing Default or Event of Default or compliance
with any provision of the indenture or the notes or the Note Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
notes).

Without the consent of each holder of notes affected, an amendment, modification, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any notes held by a
non-consenting holder):

(1)  reduce the principal amount of notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2)  reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the notes (other than
provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption "—Repurchase at the Option of Holders");

(3)  reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any note;

(4)  waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, the notes (except a rescission of
acceleration of the notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(5)  make any note payable in money other than that stated in the notes;

S-65


-----

(6)  make any change in the provisions of the indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of holders of notes to receive payments
of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, the notes;

(7)  waive a redemption payment with respect to any note (other than a payment required by one of the covenants described above under the
caption "—Repurchase at the Option of Holders");

(8)  release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or the indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the
indenture; or

(9)  make any change in the preceding amendment, supplement and waiver provisions that requires each holder's consent.

The consent of the holders of notes is not necessary under the indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such
consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

After an amendment under the indenture becomes effective, B&G Foods is required to mail to holders of notes a notice briefly describing such
amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all holders of notes, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of notes, B&G Foods, the Guarantors and the trustee may amend, modify or
supplement the indenture or the notes or the Note Guarantees:

(1)  to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;

(2)  to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes;

(3)  to provide for the assumption of B&G Foods' or a Guarantor's obligations to holders of notes and Note Guarantees in the case of a merger or
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of B&G Foods' or such Guarantor's assets, as applicable;

(4)  to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of notes or that does not adversely affect the legal

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all notes issued thereunder, when:

(1)  either:

(a)  all notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed notes that have been replaced or paid and notes for whose
payment money has been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by B&G Foods or any Guarantor and thereafter repaid to B&G
Foods or discharged from their trust, have been delivered to the trustee for cancellation; or

(b)  all notes that have not been delivered to the trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a
notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and B&G Foods or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited
or caused to be deposited with the trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable
Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable Government Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient,
without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the notes not delivered to the trustee for
cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2)  no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of the deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting
from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit) and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any
other material instrument to which B&G Foods or any Guarantor is a party or by which B&G Foods or any Guarantor is bound;

(3)  B&G Foods or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the indenture; and

(4)  B&G Foods has delivered irrevocable instructions to the trustee under the indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the
notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, B&G Foods must deliver an Officers' Certificate and an opinion of counsel (subject to customary assumptions and exceptions) to the trustee
stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Concerning the Trustee**

If the trustee becomes a creditor of B&G Foods or any Guarantor, the indenture limits the right of the trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases,
or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions;
however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as trustee (if the
indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act) or resign.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The indenture provides that in case an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own
affairs. Subject to such provisions, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the

S-67


-----

request of any holder of notes, unless such holder has offered to the trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

**Additional Information**

Anyone who receives this prospectus supplement may obtain a copy of each of the Base Indenture and the Tenth Supplemental Indenture without charge
by writing to at B&G Foods, Inc., Four Gatehall Drive, Suite 110, Parsippany, N.J. 07054, Attention: General Counsel.

**Book-Entry, Delivery and Form**

Except as set forth below, the notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof. Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

The notes initially will be represented by one or more notes in registered, global form without interest coupons (collectively, the "Global Notes"). The
Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), in New York, New York, and
registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case, for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below.

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its
nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be exchanged for definitive notes in registered certificated form ("Certificated Notes") except in
the limited circumstances described below. See "—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes." Except in the limited circumstances described below,
owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form.

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants,
which may change from time to time.

**Depository Procedures**

The following operations and procedures are solely within the control of DTC's settlement system and are subject to changes by it. B&G Foods takes no
responsibility for these operations and procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. However,
B&G Foods will remain responsible for any actions DTC and participants take in accordance with instructions provided by B&G Foods.

DTC has advised B&G Foods that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the
"Participants") and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry
changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies,
clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC's system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the "Indirect Participants").
Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The
ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and
Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised B&G Foods that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1)  upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the
principal amount of the Global Notes; and

S-68


-----

(2)  ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only
through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners
of beneficial interest in the Global Notes).

Investors who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors who are not Participants may hold their interests therein
indirectly through organizations which are Participants. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. The laws of
some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on behalf of
the Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the
DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of
notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or "holders" thereof under the indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable
to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, B&G Foods and the trustee will treat the Persons in
whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, neither B&G Foods, the trustee nor any agent of B&G Foods or the trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

(1)  any aspect of DTC's records or any Participant's or Indirect Participant's records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial
ownership interest in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC's records or any Participant's or Indirect Participant's
records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

(2)  any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants.

DTC has advised B&G Foods that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and
interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive
payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal
amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be
the responsibility of DTC, the trustee or B&G Foods. Neither B&G Foods nor the trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the
Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and B&G Foods and the trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in
relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Transfers between the Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC's procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds.

DTC has advised B&G Foods that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to
whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to
which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants.

S-69


-----

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, it is under no
obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. Except for actions taken by DTC or its
Participants or indirect Participants or their respective agents in accordance with our instructions, none of B&G Foods, the trustee and any of their respective
agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:

(1)  DTC (a) notifies B&G Foods that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing
agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, B&G Foods fails to appoint a successor depositary within 120 days after the date of
such notice from the depository;

(2)  B&G Foods, at its option, notifies the trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the Certificated Notes; or

(3)  there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default with respect to the notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior written notice given to the trustee by or on behalf
of DTC in accordance with the indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes
will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary
procedures).

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

B&G Foods will make, or cause to be made, payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and
interest, if any) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its nominee. B&G Foods will make all payments of
principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the
holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder's registered address. The notes represented by the
Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such
notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. B&G Foods expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes
will also be settled in immediately available funds.

**Certain Definitions**

**MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

This section is a discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the notes.
This section does not provide a complete analysis of all potential tax considerations. The information provided below is based on the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), U.S. Treasury Regulations, Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") rulings and pronouncements, and judicial decisions all as now
in effect and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. There can be no assurances that the IRS will not
challenge one or more of the tax consequences described herein, and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS with respect to
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning or disposing of the notes. This section generally applies only to beneficial owners of the
notes that purchase their notes in this offering for an amount equal to the issue price of the notes, which is the first price at which a substantial amount of the
notes is sold for money to the public (not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of initial
purchasers, placement agents or wholesalers), and that hold the notes as capital assets. This discussion does not purport to deal with all aspects of U.S. federal
income taxation that may be relevant to a particular beneficial owner in light of the beneficial owner's circumstances (for example, persons subject to the
alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code, or a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar). Also, it is not
intended to be applicable to all categories of investors, some of whom may be subject to special rules (such as dealers in securities or currencies, traders in
securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting, banks, thrifts or other financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, any entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
tax-deferred or other retirement accounts, a beneficial owner of the notes subject to the special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code, certain
former citizens or residents of the United States, persons holding notes as part of a hedging, conversion or integrated transaction or a straddle, or persons
deemed to sell notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code). The amortizable bond premium or market discount rules may apply to any investor
who purchases notes at a price other than the issue price and pursuant to this offering memorandum, and investors should consult their own tax advisors
regarding this possibility. Finally, this section does not describe the effect of the U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws or the effects of any applicable foreign,
state or local laws.

THIS SECTION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SPECIFIC INVESTOR IN LIGHT OF SUCH
INVESTOR'S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. INVESTORS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF THE NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX
ADVISORS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AND THE
CONSEQUENCES OF U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS, FOREIGN, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS, AND TAX TREATIES.

As used herein, the term "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of the notes that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is (1) an individual who is a
citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States, including the District of Columbia, (3) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S.
federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (4) a trust if (x) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or
more United States persons (as defined in the Code) are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (y) it has a valid election in effect under
applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.

A "Non-U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of the notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a
U.S. Holder.

S-88


-----

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial
owner of the notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A
beneficial owner of the notes that is a partnership, and partners in such partnership, should consult their own tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax
consequences to them of purchasing, owning and disposing of the notes indirectly through ownership of their partnership interests.

**Payments Subject to Certain Contingencies**

In certain circumstances described in the "Description of Notes—Optional Redemption" and "Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders," we may be obligated to pay holders of notes amounts in excess of the stated principal and interest payable on the notes. We intend to take the
position that the likelihood that such payments will be made is remote and that the additional payments are incidental, and therefore the notes are not subject
to certain rules governing contingent payment debt instruments. This determination will be binding on a holder unless such holder explicitly discloses on a
statement attached to such holder's timely filed U.S federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the note that such
holder's determination is different. It is possible, however, that the IRS may take a contrary position from that described above, in which case the tax
consequences to a holder could differ materially and adversely from those described below. The remainder of this disclosure assumes that the notes will not
be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**Consequences to U.S. Holders**

_Taxation of Interest_

A U.S. Holder will be required to recognize as ordinary income any interest paid or accrued on the notes, in accordance with the U.S. Holder's regular
method of accounting.

_Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_

A U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss if the U.S. Holder disposes of the notes in a sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition. A U.S.
Holder's gain or loss generally will equal the difference between the proceeds received by the U.S. Holder (other than amounts representing accrued but
unpaid interest, which will be taxed as ordinary income to the extent not previously included in income) and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the note.
A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal the amount the U.S. Holder paid for the note. The gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on
a disposition of the note will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the note has been held for more than one year at the time of
the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers are currently eligible for reduced rates of
taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

_Additional Tax on Net Investment Income_

Certain non-corporate U.S. Holders are subject to an additional 3.8% tax, in addition to regular tax on income and gains, on some or all of their "net
investment income," (or "undistributed net investment income," in the case of estates and trusts) which generally will include interest on the notes and gain
recognized with respect to the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors
regarding the applicability of this additional tax in respect of their notes.

S-89


-----

**Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

The following discussion applies only to Non-U.S. Holders (as defined above).

_Taxation of Interest_

Subject to the discussion below under "—Income or Gains Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business," payments of interest to Non-U.S.
Holders are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a reduced or zero rate under the terms of an applicable income tax treaty
between the United States and the Non-U.S. Holder's country of residence), collected by means of withholding by the payor. Subject to the discussions of
backup withholding and FATCA below, payments of interest on the notes to a Non-U.S. Holder that qualify as "portfolio interest" will be exempt from U.S.
federal income tax, including withholding of such tax, if the Non-U.S. Holder certifies its nonresident status as described below. The portfolio interest
exception will not apply to payments of interest to a Non-U.S. Holder that:

     - owns, actually or constructively, shares of our stock representing at least 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of our
stock entitled to vote;

     - is a "controlled foreign corporation" that is related, actually or constructively, to us through sufficient stock ownership;

     - is a bank receiving the interest pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of the Non-U.S. Holder's trade or business; or

     - does not certify its nonresident status as described below, or the applicable withholding agent has actual knowledge or reason to know the
holder is a United States person.

In general, a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation if more than 50 percent of its stock (by either voting power or value) is owned,
actually or constructively, by one or more United States persons that each owns, actually or constructively, at least 10 percent of its stock (by either voting
power or value).

The portfolio interest exception, entitlement to treaty benefits and several of the special rules for Non-U.S. Holders described below apply only if the
holder certifies its nonresident status under penalties of perjury. A Non-U.S. Holder can generally meet this certification requirement by providing a properly
completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or other applicable IRS Form W-8 or appropriate substitute form to our paying agent prior
to the payment. If treaty benefits are claimed, the Non-U.S. Holder may be required to provide a taxpayer identification number on IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS
Form W-8BEN-E. If the Non-U.S. Holder holds its notes through a financial institution or other agent acting on the holder's behalf, the holder will be required
to provide appropriate documentation to the agent. The Non-U.S. Holder's agent will then be required to provide certification to our paying agent, either
directly or through other intermediaries. For payments made to a foreign partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes), the certification requirements generally apply to the partners rather than the partnership, and the partnership must provide the
partners' documentation to us or our paying agent.

_Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_

Non-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable
disposition of notes (other than with respect to payments attributable to accrued interest, which will be taxed as described under "—Taxation of

S-90


-----

Interest" above). This general rule, however, is subject to several exceptions. For example, the gain would be subject to U.S. federal income tax if:

     - the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a U.S. trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, the
gain is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder), in which case it would be subject to tax as
described below under "—Income or Gains Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business;" or

     - subject to certain exceptions, the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year
of the disposition and certain other conditions are satisfied, in which case, except as otherwise provided by an applicable income tax treaty,
the gain would be subject to a flat 30 percent tax, which may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses, even if the individual is not
considered a resident of the U.S., provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.

_Income or Gains Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business_

The preceding discussion of the U.S. federal income and withholding tax considerations of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes by a NonU.S. Holder assumes that any interest on the notes or any gain realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes is not
effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States, if any, conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder. If any interest on the notes or gain from the sale,
exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Holder, then
the income or gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular graduated rates in the same manner as the income or gain of a U.S. Holder. If the NonU.S. Holder is eligible for the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty between the U.S. and the holder's country of residence, any "effectively connected"
income or gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the holder in the
United States. Payments of interest that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, attributable to a U.S.
permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder), and therefore included in the gross income of a Non-U.S. Holder, will not be subject to the
30 percent withholding tax described above; provided, that the holder claims exemption from withholding. To claim exemption from withholding in the case
of U.S. trade or business income, or to claim the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder must certify its qualification, which
generally can be done by filing a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8ECI (in the case of a U.S. trade or business income) or properly completed
and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (in the case of a treaty), or any successor form as the IRS designates, as applicable, prior to the
payment of interest. If the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, that portion of its earnings and profits that is effectively connected with its U.S. trade or business
may also be subject to an additional "branch profits tax" at a 30% rate (or, if applicable, a lower income tax treaty rate).

_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_

Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder ("FATCA"),
withholding taxes may apply to certain types of payments made to "foreign financial institutions" (as specially defined in the Code) and certain other nonU.S. entities, including foreign financial institutions and other entities acting as an intermediary. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on
interest on notes paid to a foreign financial institution or to a non-financial foreign entity, unless (1) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain
diligence and reporting, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any substantial United States owners or furnishes identifying
information regarding each substantial United States owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity

S-91


-----

otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements
in clause (1) above, then, pursuant to an agreement between it and the U.S. Treasury, it must, among other things, identify accounts held by certain United
States persons or United States-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to noncompliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders.

Under the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of interest on a
note. While withholding under FATCA would have applied also to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a note on or after
January 1, 2019, recently proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally
may rely on these proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations until final U.S. Treasury Regulations are issued.

Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States with respect to
FATCA may be subject to different rules. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding FATCA, the U.S. Treasury Regulations thereunder and any
applicable intergovernmental agreements with respect to FATCA.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

_U.S. Holders_

Payments of interest to U.S. Holders and payments to U.S. Holders upon a sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes generally
will be subject to information reporting on IRS Form 1099, and will be subject to backup withholding, unless the U.S. Holder provides the applicable payor
or its agent with a correct taxpayer identification number, certified under penalties of perjury, as well as certain other information, or otherwise establishes an
exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
allowed as a refund or a credit against that U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

_Non-U.S. Holders_

Backup withholding and information reporting on IRS Form 1099 will not apply to payments of interest to a Non-U.S. Holder provided that the Non-U.S.
Holder is (1) the beneficial owner of the notes and certifies to the applicable payor or its agent, under penalties of perjury, that the holder not a United States
person and provides a duly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or a suitable substitute form), (2) a securities clearing
organization, bank or other financial institution, that holds customers' securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business (a "financial institution") and
that certifies under penalties of perjury that such an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or a suitable substitute form) has been received from the
beneficial owner by it or by a financial institution between it and the beneficial owner and furnishes the payor with a copy thereof, or (C) otherwise exempt
from backup withholding and information reporting (provided that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that
the holder is a United States person or that the conditions of any other exemptions are not in fact satisfied).

Information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to a payment of the proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable
disposition of notes effected outside the United States by a foreign office of a foreign broker. However, information reporting requirements (but not backup
withholding) will apply to a payment of the proceeds of a sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of notes effected outside the United States
by a foreign office of a broker if the broker (i) is a United States person, (ii) derives 50% or more of its gross income for certain periods from the conduct of a
trade or business in the United States, (iii) is a "controlled foreign

S-92


-----

corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (iv) is a foreign partnership that, at any time during its taxable year is 50% or more (by income or capital
interest) owned by United States persons or is engaged in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, unless in any such case the broker has documentary
evidence in its records that the holder is a Non-U.S. holder and certain conditions are met, or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment of the
proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of notes by a United States office of a broker will be subject to both backup
withholding and information reporting unless the holder certifies its non-U.S. status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption.
Information returns are required to be filed by the IRS in connection with any interest paid to the Non-U.S. Holder, regardless of whether any tax was
withheld.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against
that Non-U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
Citizens Capital Markets, Inc.
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Rabo Securities USA, Inc.
TD Securities (USA) LLC
Total $ 450,000,000

The underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters' obligation to purchase the notes depends on the satisfaction of the conditions contained in
the underwriting agreement including:

     - the obligation to purchase all of the notes offered hereby, if any of the notes are purchased;

     - the representations and warranties made by us and the guarantors to the underwriters are true;

     - there is no material change in our or the guarantors' business or the financial markets; and

     - we and the guarantors deliver customary closing documents to the underwriters.

**Commissions and Expenses**

The underwriters will purchase the notes at the discount from the offering price indicated on the cover of this prospectus supplement and propose
initially to offer and sell the notes at the offering price set forth on the front of this prospectus supplement, less a concession not to exceed    % of the
principal amount of the notes. The underwriters may allow, and dealers may re-allow a concession not to exceed    % of the principal amount of the notes
on sales to other dealers. If all the notes are not sold at the initial offering price following the initial offering, the underwriters may change the initial public
offering price and other selling terms.

The following table shows the underwriting discount that we will pay to the underwriters in connection with this offering, expressed as a percentage of
the principal amount of the notes and in total:

**Per Note** **Total**
Underwriting discount %$

We estimate that our share of the total expenses of the offering, excluding the underwriting discount, will be approximately $      .

S-94


-----

David Wenner, a director of our company and our former president and chief executive officer, holds $1,000,000 principal amount of our 2021 notes and
has indicated an interest to purchase $1,000,000 principal amount of the notes.

**Lock-Up**

We and the guarantors have agreed that we will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the SEC a
registration statement under the Securities Act relating to United States dollar-denominated debt securities issued or guaranteed by us or any guarantor and
having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing,
without the prior written consent of Barclays Capital Inc. for a period beginning on the date of this prospectus supplement and ending 90 days after the
closing date.

**Indemnification**

We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to payments that
the underwriters may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

**Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in certain transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the notes.
Specifically, the underwriters may overallot in connection with the offering of the notes, creating a syndicate short position. In addition, the underwriters may
bid for and purchase notes in the open market to cover syndicate short positions or to stabilize the price of the notes. Any of these activities may stabilize or
maintain the market price of the notes above what it would be in the absence of such activities. The underwriters are not required to engage in any of these
activities, and they may end any of them at any time. We and the underwriters make no representation as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the
transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, we and the underwriters make no representation that anyone will engage in such
transactions or that such transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the closing date specified on the coverage page of this
prospectus, which will be the    day following the date of pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as "T+    "). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any
such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes on the date of pricing or the      succeeding business days will be
required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle T+      , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a
failed settlement. Purchasers of notes who wish to trade notes on the date of pricing or the succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.

**Electronic Distribution**

A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the Internet sites or through other online services maintained by one or more of the
underwriters and/or selling group members participating in this offering, or by their affiliates. In those cases, prospective investors may view offering terms
online and, depending upon the particular underwriter or selling group member,

S-95


-----

prospective investors may be allowed to place orders online. The underwriters may agree with us to allocate a specific number of notes for sale to online
brokerage account holders. Any such allocation for online distributions will be made by the representative on the same basis as other allocations.

Other than the prospectus in electronic format, the information on any underwriter's or selling group member's web site and any information contained in
any other web site maintained by an underwriter or selling group member is not part of the prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus
forms a part, has not been approved and/or endorsed by us or any underwriter or selling group member in its capacity as underwriter or selling group member
and should not be relied upon by investors.

**Other Relationships**

The underwriters and certain of their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities
sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging,
market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. The underwriters and certain of their respective affiliates have, from
time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial and investment banking and financial advisory services for the issuer, its
affiliates, and other persons and entities with relationships with the issuer, for which they have received or may in the future receive customary fees and
expenses. Affiliates of certain of the underwriters serve as a lender, arranger and/or agent under our credit agreement and, as a result, those that are lenders
under our revolving credit facility under our credit agreement will receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering, as described above. Certain of the
underwriters and/or their affiliates may hold some of the 2021 notes and may therefore receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to the extent used
to repay the 2021 notes.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and certain of their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments
and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for
the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the issuer or its affiliates. If the
underwriters or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those underwriters or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those
underwriters or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the underwriters
and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of
short positions in our securities or the securities of our affiliates, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The underwriters and certain of their affiliates may also communicate
independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**Selling Restrictions**

rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser's province or territory. The
purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser's province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult
with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the underwriters are not required to comply with the
disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.

**_United Kingdom_**

This prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus have not been approved by an authorized person for the purposes of section 21 of
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA") and are, accordingly, only being distributed in the United Kingdom to, and are only directed at
(i) investment professionals falling within the description of persons in Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion)
Order 2005, as amended (the "Financial Promotion Order"); or (ii) high net worth companies and other persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the
Financial Promotion Order; or (iii) to any other person to whom they may otherwise lawfully be communicated or made in accordance with the Financial
Promotion Order (all such persons together being referred to as "relevant persons").

The notes are only available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such notes will be engaged in only
with, relevant persons. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this document or any of its contents.

An invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any
notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated by this prospectus will only be communicated or caused to be communicated in circumstances in
which Section 21(1) of FSMA does not apply to us.

**_EEA_**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the European Economic Area. For these purposes a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of:

     - a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, "MiFID II");

     - a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point
(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

     - not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded, the "Prospectus Regulation").

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling
the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the European Economic Area has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

S-97


-----

This prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus have been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of the
European Economic Area will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
notes. Neither this prospectus supplement nor the accompanying base prospectus is a prospectus for purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of Hong Kong), or (ii) to "professional investors" within the meaning of the Securities and Futures
Ordinance (Cap.571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder, or (iii) in other circumstances which do not result in the document being a
"prospectus" within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of Hong Kong), and no advertisement, invitation or document relating to the
notes may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is directed at,
or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the laws of Hong Kong) other than

**ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS**

This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) using a "shelf" registration process.
Under this shelf registration process, we may offer from time to time, in one or more offerings, together or separately, common stock, preferred stock, debt
securities, warrants or units. Each time we offer securities, we will provide you with a prospectus supplement that describes the specific amounts, prices and
terms of the securities we offer. The prospectus supplement also may add, update or change information contained in this prospectus. You should read
carefully both this prospectus and any prospectus supplement together with additional information described below under the caption "Where You Can Find
More Information."

This prospectus does not contain all the information provided in the registration statement we filed with the SEC. For further information about us or our
securities offered hereby, you should refer to that registration statement, which you can obtain from the SEC as described below under the heading "Where
You Can Find More Information."

We have not authorized anyone to provide information or to make any representations other than those contained in this prospectus or a prospectus
supplement. We take no responsibility for, and can provide no assurance as to the reliability of, any other information that others may give you. This
prospectus is not an offer to sell securities, and it is not soliciting an offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. You
should assume that the information appearing in this prospectus or any prospectus supplement, as well as information we have previously filed with the SEC
and incorporated by reference, is accurate as of the date on the front of those documents only. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects may have changed since those dates.

We may sell securities through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of these methods. We and our
agents reserve the sole right to accept or reject, in whole or in part, any proposed purchase of securities. The prospectus supplement, which we will provide to
you each time we offer securities, will set forth the names of any underwriters, dealers, agents or others involved in the sale of securities and any applicable
fee, commission or discount arrangements with them. See the information described below under the heading "Plan of Distribution."

The terms "B&G Foods," "our," "we" and "us," as used in this prospectus, refer to B&G Foods, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, except where it is
clear that the term refers only to the parent company.

and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, or any updates in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, together with all of the other information
appearing in this prospectus or incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement, in

**SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This prospectus and the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and each prospectus supplement relating
to a particular offering of securities, contain forward-looking statements. The words "believes," "belief," "expects," "projects," "intends," "anticipates,"
"assumes," "could," "should," "estimates," "potential," "seek," "predict," "may," "will" or "plans" and similar references to future periods are intended to
identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our
actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or
implied by any forward-looking statements. We believe important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include the
following:

     - our substantial leverage;

     - the effects of rising costs for our raw materials, packaging and ingredients;

     - crude oil prices and their impact on distribution, packaging and energy costs;

     - our ability to successfully implement sales price increases and cost saving measures to offset any cost increases;

     - intense competition, changes in consumer preferences, demand for our products and local economic and market conditions;

     - our continued ability to promote brand equity successfully, to anticipate and respond to new consumer trends, to develop new products and
markets, to broaden brand portfolios in order to compete effectively with lower priced products and in markets that are consolidating at the
retail and manufacturing levels, and to improve productivity;

     - the risks associated with the expansion of our business;

     - our possible inability to identify new acquisitions or to integrate recent or future acquisitions or our failure to realize anticipated revenue
enhancements, cost savings or other synergies;

     - tax reform legislation, including the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;

     - our ability to access the credit markets and our borrowing costs and credit ratings, which may be influenced by credit markets generally and
the credit ratings of our competitors;

     - unanticipated expenses, including, without limitation, litigation or legal settlement expenses;

     - the effects of currency movements of the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso as compared to the U.S. dollar;

     - the effects of international trade disputes, tariffs, quotas, and other import or export restrictions on our international procurement, sales and
operations;

     - future impairments of our goodwill and intangible assets;

     - our ability to successfully complete the implementation of and operate a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system;

     - our ability to protect information systems against, or effectively respond to, a cybersecurity incident or other disruption;

     - our sustainability initiatives and changes to environmental laws and regulations;

iv


-----

         - recalls if products become adulterated or misbranded, liability if product consumption causes injury, ingredient disclosure and labeling
laws and regulations and the possibility that consumers could lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products;

         - competitors' pricing practices and promotional spending levels;

         - fluctuations in the level of our customers' inventories and credit and other business risks related to our customers operating in a
challenging economic and competitive environment; and

         - the risks associated with third-party suppliers and co-packers, including the risk that any failure by one or more of our third-party
suppliers or co-packers to comply with food safety or other laws and regulations may disrupt our supply of raw materials or certain
finished goods products or injure our reputation; and

     - other factors discussed under "Risk Factors" or elsewhere in this prospectus and the documents incorporated or deemed incorporated herein by
reference.

Developments in any of these areas, which are more fully described elsewhere in this prospectus and the documents incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and each applicable prospectus supplement, could cause our results to differ materially from results that have
been or may be projected by us or on our behalf.

All forward-looking statements included in this prospectus are based on information available to us on the date of this prospectus. We undertake no
obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent
written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
statements contained in this prospectus.

We caution that the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive. There may be other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially
from the forward-looking statements, including factors disclosed elsewhere in this prospectus or incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in
this prospectus or any applicable prospectus supplement. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements in the context of these risks and uncertainties.
We urge you not to unduly rely on forward-looking statements contained or incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in this prospectus or any
applicable prospectus supplement.

which may include reducing or refinancing our outstanding indebtedness, increasing our working capital or financing acquisitions and capital expenditures.
When a particular series of securities is offered, the prospectus supplement relating to that offering will set forth our intended use of the net proceeds received
from the sale of those securities. Pending the application of the net proceeds for these purposes, we expect to invest the proceeds in short-term, interestbearing instruments or other investment-grade securities.

the offering and sale of the offered securities, as well as complete descriptions of the security or securities to be offered pursuant to the prospectus
supplement. The summary descriptions of securities included in this prospectus are not meant to be complete descriptions of each security.

**DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK**

**General**

The following description of common stock and preferred stock, together with the additional information we include in any applicable prospectus
supplements, summarizes the material terms and provisions of the common stock and preferred stock that we may offer under this prospectus. For the
complete terms of our common stock and preferred stock, please refer to our certificate of incorporation, as amended from time to time, any certificates of
designation for our preferred stock, and our bylaws, as amended from time to time. The Delaware General Corporation Law may also affect the terms of these
securities. While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally to any future common stock or preferred stock that we may offer, we will describe
the particular terms of any series of these securities in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement. If we so indicate in a prospectus supplement, the
terms of any common stock or preferred stock we offer under that prospectus supplement may differ from the terms we describe below.

Our authorized capital stock consists of:

     - 125,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share; and

     - 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.

As of August 6, 2019, there are 65,375,514 shares of our common stock outstanding. There are no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

**Common Stock**

_Voting.  The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share with respect to each matter on which the holders of our common stock are_
entitled to vote.

_No Cumulative Voting Rights.  The holders of our common stock are not entitled to cumulate their votes in the election of our directors._

-----

lawfully declared from time to time by our board of directors, subject to any preferential rights of holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock. In the
event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, common stockholders are entitled to share ratably in our assets available for distribution
to the stockholders, subject to the prior rights of holders of any outstanding preferred stock.

Our dividend policy reflects a basic judgment that our stockholders are better served when we distribute a substantial portion of our cash available to pay
dividends to them instead of retaining it in our business. Under this policy, a substantial portion of the cash generated by our company in excess of operating
needs, interest and principal payments on indebtedness, capital expenditures sufficient to maintain our properties and other assets is distributed as regular
quarterly cash dividends to the holders of our common stock and not retained by us.

We have paid dividends every quarter since our initial public offering in October 2004. Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.475 per share. The
following table sets forth the dividends per share we have declared in each of the quarterly periods of 2017 and 2018 and the first three quarterly periods of
2019:

**Fiscal 2019** **Fiscal 2018** **Fiscal 2017**
Fourth Quarter N/A $ 0.475 $ 0.465
Third Quarter $ 0.475 $ 0.475 $ 0.465
Second Quarter $ 0.475 $ 0.475 $ 0.465
First Quarter $ 0.475 $ 0.465 $ 0.465

However, notwithstanding the dividend policy, the amount of dividends, if any, for each dividend payment date will be determined by our board of
directors on a quarterly basis after taking into account various factors, including our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, the
dividend restrictions set forth in our debt agreements, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Our
dividend policy is based upon our current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate, and that assessment could change based on
competitive or other developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures or working capital), new acquisition opportunities
or other factors. Our board of directors is free to depart from or change our dividend policy at any time and could do so, for example, if it was to determine
that we have insufficient cash to take advantage of growth opportunities.

**We cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends at the historical level set forth above or at all. Dividend payments are not mandatory**
**or guaranteed, and holders of our common stock do not have any legal right to receive, or require us to pay, dividends. Our board of directors may, in**
**its sole discretion, amend or repeal this dividend policy at any time. Furthermore, our board of directors may decrease the level of dividends below the**
**rate historically paid or discontinue entirely the payment of dividends.**

_Preemptive and Other Subscription Rights.  Common stockholders do not have preemptive, subscription or redemption rights and are not subject to_
further calls or assessments.

_Additional Issuance of Our Authorized Common Stock.  Additional shares of our authorized common stock may be issued, as determined by the board_
of directors of our company from time to time, without approval of holders of our common stock, except as may be required by applicable law or the rules of
any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded.

3


-----

Our certificate of incorporation provides that we may issue up to 1,000,000 shares of our preferred stock in one or more series as may be determined by
our board of directors.

Our board of directors has broad discretionary authority with respect to the rights of issued series of our preferred stock and may take several actions
without any vote or action of the holders of our common stock, including:

     - determining the number of shares to be included in each series;

     - fixing the designation, powers, preferences and relative rights of the shares of each series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions with
respect to each series, including provisions related to dividends, conversion, voting, redemption and liquidation, which may be superior to
those of our common stock; and

     - increasing or decreasing the number of shares of any series.

The board of directors may authorize, without approval of holders of our common stock, the issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion
rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of our common stock. For example, our preferred stock may rank prior to our
common stock as to dividend rights, liquidation preferences or both, may have full or limited voting rights and may be convertible into shares of our
common stock. The number of authorized shares of our preferred stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding)
by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our common stock, without a vote of the holders of any other class or series of our preferred
stock unless required by the terms of such class or series of preferred stock.

Our preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms designed to delay or prevent a change in the control of our company or to make the removal of
our management more difficult. This could have the effect of discouraging third-party bids for our common stock or may otherwise adversely affect the
market price of our common stock.

We believe that the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of our preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in structuring
possible future financings and acquisitions, and in meeting other corporate needs that might arise. The authorized shares of our preferred stock, as well as
shares of our common stock, will be available for issuance without action by our common stockholders, unless such action is required by applicable law or
the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded.

Although our board of directors has no intention at the present time of doing so, it could issue a series of our preferred stock that could, depending on the
terms of such series, be used to implement a stockholder rights plan or otherwise impede the completion of a merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt of
our company. Our board of directors could issue preferred stock having terms that could discourage an acquisition attempt through which an acquiror may be
able to change the composition of the board of directors, including a tender offer or other transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might
believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then current market price.

**Composition of Board of Directors; Election and Removal of Directors**

In accordance with our bylaws, the number of directors comprising our board of directors will be as determined from time to time by our board of
directors. We currently have nine directors. Each director is to hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. Directors are elected for a
term that will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders immediately succeeding their election.

-----

outstanding shares of our capital stock that are entitled to vote generally in the election of our directors, voting together as a single class. Subject to the rights
of the holders of any series of preferred stock, our certificate of incorporation provides that in the case of any vacancies among the directors such vacancy will
be filled with a candidate approved by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum (and not by stockholders).

The filling of vacancies could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to
acquire, control of us.

At any meeting of our board of directors, a majority of the total number of directors then in office will constitute a quorum for all purposes.

**Stockholder Action**

Stockholders may act by written consent, without a meeting and without notice or a vote. This provision enables stockholders to act on matters subject
to a stockholder vote without waiting until the next annual or special meeting of stockholders.

**Special Meetings of Stockholders**

Our certificate of incorporation provides that special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, the chairman of
the board of directors or the holders of at least 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.

**Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law**

Our company is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation
from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a three-year period following the time that this stockholder becomes an
interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A "business combination" includes a merger, asset sale or other
transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An "interested stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and associates,
owns (or, in some cases, within three years prior, did own) 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. Under Section 203, a business combination between
the corporation and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless it satisfies one of the following conditions:

     - the board of directors must have previously approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
becoming an interested stockholder;

     - upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder
owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding, for purposes of
determining the number of our shares outstanding, shares owned by (a) persons who are directors and also officers and (b) employee stock
plans, in some instances); or

     - the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the
stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.

The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors,
including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of our common stock.

5


-----

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain several provisions, in addition to those pertaining to the issuance of additional shares of our
authorized common stock and preferred stock without the approval of the holders of our common stock that could delay or make more difficult the
acquisition of our company through a hostile tender offer, open market purchases, proxy contest, merger or other takeover attempt that a stockholder might
consider in his or her best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of our common stock. Such provisions,
which are described below, include advance notice procedures regarding any proposal of stockholder business to be discussed at a stockholders meeting.

_Advance Notice Procedure for Director Nominations and Stockholder Proposals.  Our bylaws provide that, subject to the rights of holders of any_
outstanding shares of our preferred stock, a stockholder may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of the
stockholder's nomination has been given, either by personal delivery or certified mail, to our corporate secretary not less than 120 days nor more than
150 days before the first anniversary of the date of our proxy statement in connection with our last annual meeting of stockholders. Each notice must contain:

     - the name, age, business address and, if known, residential address of each nominee;

     - the principal occupation or employment of each nominee;

     - a statement of the particular experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of the proposed nominee;

     - the class, series and number of our shares beneficially owned by each nominee;

     - any other information relating to each nominee required by the SEC's proxy rules; and

     - the written consent of each nominee to be named in our proxy statement and to serve as director if elected.

Our corporate secretary will deliver all notices to the nominating committee of our board of directors for review. After review, the nominating committee
will make its recommendation regarding nominees to our board of directors. Defective nominations will be disregarded.

For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice of the proposed business
in writing to our corporate secretary. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be given, either by personal delivery or by certified mail, to our corporate
secretary not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days before the first anniversary of the date of our proxy statement in connection with our last annual
meeting of stockholders. Each notice must contain:

     - a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting the business at the annual
meeting;

     - the name and address of the stockholder proposing the business as they appear on our stock transfer books;

     - a representation that the stockholder is a stockholder of record and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring the
business proposed in the notice before the meeting;

     - the class, series and number of our shares beneficially owned by the stockholder; and

     - any material interest of the stockholder in the business.

Business brought before an annual meeting without complying with these provisions will not be transacted.

-----

business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting, our bylaws may have the effect of precluding the consideration of some business at a meeting if the
proper procedures are not followed or may discourage or defer a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors
or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.

**Amendment of Our Certificate of Incorporation**

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of our capital stock that are entitled to vote
generally in the election of our directors, voting together as a single class, is required to amend, alter, change or repeal the provisions of our certificate of
incorporation.

**Amendment of Our Bylaws**

Our certificate of incorporation provides that our bylaws can be amended only by either our board of directors or the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of our capital stock that are entitled to vote generally in the election of our directors,
voting together as a single class.

**Limitation of Liability and Indemnification**

Our certificate of incorporation provides that, to the full extent from time to time permitted by law, no director shall be personally liable for monetary
damages for breach of any duty as a director. As required under current Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation currently provides that this waiver may
not apply to liability:

     - for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;

     - for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

     - under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (pertaining to certain prohibited act including unlawful payment of dividends or
unlawful purchase or redemption of our capital stock); or

     - for any transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit.

However, in the event the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal
liability of directors, then the liability of our directors will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law,
as so amended. Neither the amendment or repeal of this provision of our certificate of incorporation, nor the adoption of any provision of our certificate of
incorporation which is inconsistent with this provision, shall eliminate or reduce the protection afforded by this provision with respect to any matter which
occurred, or any suit or claim which, but for this provision would have accrued or arisen, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.

Our bylaws also provide that we shall, to the fullest extent from time to time permitted by law, indemnify our directors and officers against all liabilities
and expenses in any suit or proceeding, arising out of their status as an officer or director or their activities in these capacities. Our bylaws also require us to
indemnify any person who, at our request, is or was serving as a director, officer or trustee of another corporation, joint venture, employee benefit plan trust or
other enterprise.

receive an undertaking to repay such amount if it shall be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified.

Our board of directors may take such action as it deems necessary to carry out these indemnification provisions, including adopting procedures for
determining and enforcing indemnification rights and purchasing insurance policies. Our board of directors may also adopt bylaws, resolutions or contracts
implementing indemnification arrangements as may be permitted by law. Neither the amendment or repeal of these indemnification provisions, nor the
adoption of any provision of our certificate of incorporation inconsistent with these indemnification provisions, shall eliminate or reduce any rights to
indemnification relating to their status or any activities prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption.

We believe these provisions will assist in attracting and retaining qualified individuals to serve as directors.

**Listing**

Our shares of common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "BGS."

**Transfer Agent and Registrar**

The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A.

**DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES**

As used in this prospectus, debt securities means the debentures, notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness that we may issue from time to time.
The debt securities may be either secured or unsecured and will either be our senior debt securities or our subordinated debt securities. The debt securities
may be issued under the indenture, dated as of June 4, 2013, between us and the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, or may be issued under an indenture to
be entered into between us and one or more trustees named in the applicable prospectus supplement, a form of which is attached as an exhibit to the
registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Any debt securities that we issue under this prospectus will be governed by the applicable
indenture and a separate supplemental indenture setting out the particular terms of a series of debt securities.

This section describes certain general terms and provisions that we expect would be applicable to our debt securities. When we offer to sell a particular
series of debt securities, we will describe the specific terms of that series in a supplement to this prospectus. The following description of debt securities will
apply to the debt securities offered by this prospectus unless we provide otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. The applicable prospectus
supplement for a particular series of debt securities may specify different or additional terms.

The statements and descriptions in this prospectus or in any prospectus supplement regarding provisions of the indentures and debt securities are
summaries thereof, do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the indentures
(and any amendments or supplements we may enter into from time to time which are permitted under each indenture) and the debt securities, including the
definitions therein of certain terms.

8


-----

Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, the debt securities will be direct unsecured obligations of B&G Foods. The senior debt securities
will rank equally with any of our other senior and unsubordinated debt. The subordinated debt securities will be subordinate and junior in right of payment
to any senior indebtedness.

Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, the indentures do not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that we may issue
and provide that we may issue debt securities from time to time at par or at a discount, and in the case of the new indentures, if any, in one or more series, with
the same or various maturities. Unless indicated in a prospectus supplement, we may issue additional debt securities of a particular series without the consent
of the holders of the debt securities of such series outstanding at the time of the issuance. Any such additional debt securities, together with all other
outstanding debt securities of that series, will constitute a single series of debt securities under the applicable indenture.

Each prospectus supplement will describe the terms relating to the specific series of debt securities being offered. These terms will include some or all of
the following:

     - the title of debt securities and whether they are subordinated debt securities or senior debt securities;

     - any limit on the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities;

     - the ability to issue additional debt securities of the same series;

     - the price or prices at which we will sell the debt securities;

     - whether the debt securities of the series will be guaranteed and the terms of any such guarantee;

     - the maturity date or dates of the debt securities;

     - the rate or rates of interest, if any, which may be fixed or variable, at which the debt securities will bear interest, or the method of determining
such rate or rates, if any;

     - the date or dates from which any interest will accrue or the method by which such date or dates will be determined;

     - the right, if any, to extend the interest payment periods and the duration of any such deferral period, including the maximum consecutive
period during which interest payment periods may be extended;

     - whether the amount of payments of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the debt securities may be determined with reference to
any index, formula or other method, such as one or more currencies, commodities, equity indices or other indices, and the manner of
determining the amount of such payments;

     - the dates on which we will pay interest on the debt securities and the regular record date for determining who is entitled to the interest payable
on any interest payment date;

     - the place or places where the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the debt securities will be payable, where any securities may be
surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange or conversion, as applicable, and notices and demands may be delivered to or upon us
pursuant to the indenture;

     - if we possess the option to do so, the periods within which and the prices at which we may redeem the debt securities, in whole or in part,
pursuant to optional redemption provisions, and the other terms and conditions of any such provisions;

9


-----

provision or at the option of holders of the debt securities, and the period or periods within which and the price or prices at which we will
redeem, repay or purchase the debt securities, in whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation, and the other terms and conditions of such
obligation;

     - the denominations in which the debt securities will be issued, if other than denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof;

     - the portion, or methods of determining the portion, of the principal amount of the debt securities which we must pay upon the acceleration of
the maturity of the debt securities in connection with an event of default (as described below), if other than the full principal amount;

     - the currency, currencies or currency unit in which we will pay the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the debt securities, if
not U.S. dollars;

     - provisions, if any, granting special rights to holders of the debt securities upon the occurrence of specified events;

     - any deletions from, modifications of or additions to the events of default or our covenants with respect to the applicable series of debt
securities, and whether or not such events of default or covenants are consistent with those contained in the applicable indenture;

     - any limitation on our ability to incur debt, redeem shares, sell our assets or other restrictions;

     - the application, if any, of the terms of the indenture relating to defeasance and covenant defeasance (which terms are described below) to the
debt securities;

     - whether the subordination provisions summarized below or different subordination provisions will apply to the debt securities;

     - the terms, if any, upon which the holders may convert or exchange the debt securities into or for our common stock, preferred stock or other
securities or property;

     - whether any of the debt securities will be issued in global form and, if so, the terms and conditions upon which global debt securities may be
exchanged for certificated debt securities;

     - any change in the right of the trustee or the requisite holders of debt securities to declare the principal amount thereof due and payable
because of an event of default;

     - the depository for global or certificated debt securities;

Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will not be listed on any securities exchange.

Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will be issued in fully-registered form without coupons.

Debt securities may be sold at a substantial discount below their stated principal amount or bearing no interest or interest at a rate which at the time of
issuance is below market rates. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the federal income tax consequences and special considerations
applicable to any such debt securities. The debt securities may also be issued as indexed securities or securities denominated in foreign currencies, currency
units or composite currencies, as described in more detail in the prospectus supplement relating to any of the particular debt securities.

10


-----

Debt securities may be guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries if so provided in the applicable prospectus supplement. The prospectus
supplement will describe the terms of any guarantees, including, among other things, the method for determining the identity of the guarantors and the
conditions under which guarantees will be added or released. Any guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the guarantors. The obligations of each
guarantor under its guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent that guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under
applicable law.

**Subordination**

The prospectus supplement relating to any offering of subordinated debt securities will describe the specific subordination provisions. However, unless
otherwise noted in the prospectus supplement, subordinated debt securities will be subordinate and junior in right of payment to any existing senior
indebtedness.

Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, under the applicable indenture, "senior indebtedness" means all amounts due on
obligations in connection with any of the following, whether outstanding at the date of execution of the applicable indenture, or thereafter incurred or
created:

     - the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest due on our indebtedness for borrowed money and indebtedness evidenced by bonds, notes,
debentures or similar instruments or letters of credit (or reimbursement agreements in respect thereof);

     - all of our capital lease obligations or attributable debt (as will be defined in the applicable indenture) in respect of sale and leaseback
transactions;

     - all obligations representing the balance deferred and unpaid of the purchase price of any property or services, which purchase price is due
more than six months after the date of placing such property in service or taking delivery and title thereto, except any such balance that
constitutes an accrued expense or trade payable or any similar obligation to trade creditors;

     - all of our obligations in respect of interest rate swap agreements (whether from fixed to floating or from floating to fixed), interest rate cap
agreements and interest rate collar agreements; other agreements or arrangements designed to manage interest rates or interest rate risk; and
other agreements or arrangements designed to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates or commodity prices;

     - all obligations of the types referred to above of other persons for the payment of which we are responsible or liable as obligor, guarantor or
otherwise; and

     - all obligations of the types referred to above of other persons secured by any lien on any property or asset of ours (whether or not such
obligation is assumed by us).

However, senior indebtedness does not include:

     - any indebtedness which expressly provides that such indebtedness shall not be senior in right of payment to the subordinated debt securities,
or that such indebtedness shall be subordinated to any other of our indebtedness, unless such indebtedness expressly provides that such
indebtedness shall be senior in right of payment to the subordinated debt securities;

     - any of our obligations to our subsidiaries or of a subsidiary guarantor to us or any other of our other subsidiaries;

11


-----

     - any accounts payable or other liability to trade creditors arising in the ordinary course of business (including guarantees thereof or instruments
evidencing such liabilities);

     - any obligations with respect to any capital stock;

     - any indebtedness incurred in violation of the applicable indenture, provided that indebtedness under our credit facilities will not cease to be
senior indebtedness under this bullet point if the lenders of such indebtedness obtained an officer's certificate as of the date of incurrence of
such indebtedness to the effect that such indebtedness was permitted to be incurred by the indenture; and

     - any of our indebtedness in respect of the subordinated debt securities.

Senior indebtedness shall continue to be senior indebtedness and be entitled to the benefits of the subordination provisions irrespective of any
amendment, modification or waiver of any term of such senior indebtedness.

Unless otherwise noted in an accompanying prospectus supplement, if we default in the payment of any principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on
any senior indebtedness when it becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or at a date fixed for prepayment or by declaration or otherwise, then, unless
and until such default is cured or waived or ceases to exist, we will make no direct or indirect payment (in cash, property, securities, by set-off or otherwise) in
respect of the principal of or interest on the subordinated debt securities or in respect of any redemption, retirement, purchase or other requisition of any of
the subordinated debt securities.

In the event of the acceleration of the maturity of any subordinated debt securities, the holders of all senior debt securities outstanding at the time of such
acceleration, subject to any security interest, will first be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due on the senior debt securities before the holders
of the subordinated debt securities will be entitled to receive any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest on the subordinated debt securities.

If any of the following events occurs, we will pay in full all senior indebtedness before we make any payment or distribution under the subordinated debt
securities, whether in cash, securities or other property, to any holder of subordinated debt securities:

     - any dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of B&G Foods, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency
or receivership;

     - any general assignment by us for the benefit of creditors; or

     - any other marshaling of our assets or liabilities.

In such event, any payment or distribution under the subordinated debt securities, whether in cash, securities or other property, which would otherwise
(but for the subordination provisions) be payable or deliverable in respect of the subordinated debt securities, will be paid or delivered directly to the holders
of senior indebtedness in accordance with the priorities then existing among such holders until all senior indebtedness has been paid in full. If any payment
or distribution under the subordinated debt securities is received by the trustee of any subordinated debt securities in contravention of any of the terms of the
applicable indenture and before all the senior indebtedness has been paid in full, such payment or distribution will be received in trust for the benefit of, and
paid over or delivered and transferred to, the holders of the senior indebtedness at the time outstanding in accordance with the priorities then existing among
such holders for application to the payment of all senior indebtedness remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay all such senior indebtedness in full.

indebtedness.

Unless otherwise indicated in an applicable prospectus supplement, if any series of subordinated debt securities is guaranteed by certain of our
subsidiaries, then the guarantee will be subordinated to the senior indebtedness of such guarantor to the same extent as the subordinated debt securities are
subordinated to the senior indebtedness.

**Consolidation, Merger, Sale of Assets and Other Transactions**

Unless an accompanying prospectus supplement states otherwise, we may not (1) merge with or into or consolidate with another corporation or sell,
assign, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, any other corporation other than a direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of ours, and (2) no corporation may merge with or into or consolidate with us or, except for any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ours,
sell, assign, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of its properties and assets to us, unless:

     - we are the surviving corporation or the corporation formed by or surviving such merger or consolidation or to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, lease or conveyance has been made, if other than us, has expressly assumed by supplemental indenture all of our obligations under the
applicable indenture;

     - immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing;

     - we or the corporation formed by or surviving such merger or consolidation or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease or conveyance has
been made (if other than us) would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect to the transaction and any related financing
transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either:

         - be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional indebtedness pursuant to the fixed charge coverage ratio test set forth in the
applicable indenture; or

         - have a fixed charge coverage ratio that is equal to or greater than our fixed charge coverage ratio immediately prior to the
consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition; and

     - we deliver to the trustee an officers' certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that the supplemental indenture complies with the
applicable indenture.

**Events of Default, Notice and Waiver**

Unless an accompanying prospectus supplement states otherwise, the following shall constitute "events of default" under the applicable indenture with
respect to each series of debt securities:

     - we default for 30 consecutive days in the payment when due of interest on the debt securities;

     - we default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the debt securities;

     - our failure to observe or perform any other of our covenants or agreements with respect to such debt securities for 60 days after we receive
notice of such failure;

     - except as permitted by the applicable indenture, if debt securities are guaranteed, any guarantee shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be
unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any

13


-----

under its guarantee;

     - certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of B&G Foods; or

     - any other event of default provided with respect to securities of that series.

Unless an accompanying prospectus supplement states otherwise, if an event of default with respect to any debt securities of any series outstanding under
any indenture shall occur and be continuing, the trustee under such indenture or the holders of at least 25% (or at least 10%, in respect of a remedy (other
than acceleration) for certain events of default relating to the payment of dividends) in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of that series
outstanding may declare, by notice as provided in the applicable indenture, the principal amount (or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the debt
securities of that series) of all the debt securities of that series outstanding to be due and payable immediately; provided that, in the case of an event of
default involving certain events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, acceleration is automatic; and, provided further, that after such acceleration,
but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series
may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if all events of default, other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, have been
cured or waived. Upon the acceleration of the maturity of original issue discount securities, an amount less than the principal amount thereof will become due
and payable. Reference is made to the prospectus supplement relating to any original issue discount securities for the particular provisions relating to
acceleration of maturity thereof.

Any past default under an indenture with respect to debt securities of any series, and any event of default arising therefrom, may be waived by the holders
of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities of such series outstanding under such indenture, except in the case of (1) default in the payment of the
principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any debt securities of such series or (2) certain events of default relating to the payment of dividends.

The trustee is required within 90 days after the occurrence of a default (which is known to the trustee and is continuing), with respect to the debt
securities of any series (without regard to any grace period or notice requirements), to give to the holders of the debt securities of such series notice of such
default.

The trustee, subject to its duties during default to act with the required standard of care, may require indemnification satisfactory to it by the holders of
the debt securities of any series with respect to which a default has occurred before proceeding to exercise any right or power under the applicable indenture
at the request of the holders of the debt securities of such series. Subject to such right of indemnification and to certain other limitations, the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series under any indenture may direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to the debt securities of such series,
provided that such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with the applicable indenture and the trustee may take any other action deemed
proper by the trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

No holder of a debt security of any series may institute any action against us under any indenture (except actions for payment of overdue principal of
(and premium, if any) or interest on such debt security or for the conversion or exchange of such debt security in accordance with its terms) unless (1) the
holder has given to the trustee written notice of an event of default and of the continuance thereof with respect to the debt securities of such series specifying
an event of default, as required under the applicable indenture, (2) the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of that
series then outstanding under such indenture shall have requested the trustee to institute such action and offered to the trustee indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to it against the costs,

14


-----

and (4) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the trustee during such 60-day period by the holders of a majority in principal
amount of the debt securities of that series.

We will be required to furnish annually to the trustee statements as to our compliance with all conditions and covenants under each indenture.

**Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

We may discharge or defease our obligations under each indenture as set forth below, unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus
supplement.

We or, if applicable, any guarantor may discharge certain obligations to holders of any series of debt securities issued under any indenture which have
not already been delivered to the trustee for cancellation by irrevocably depositing with the trustee money in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the
entire indebtedness on such debt securities not previously delivered to the trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of
such deposit (in the case of debt securities which have become due and payable) or to the stated maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and we or, if
applicable, any guarantor, have paid all other sums payable under the applicable indenture.

If indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we, or, if applicable, the guarantors, may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and
all obligations with respect to the debt securities of or within any series and all obligations with respect to guarantees in the case of guarantors (except in all
cases as otherwise provided in the relevant indenture) ("legal defeasance") or (2) to be released from our obligations with respect to certain covenants
applicable to the debt securities of or within any series ("covenant defeasance"), upon the deposit with the relevant indenture trustee, in trust for such
purpose, of money and/or government obligations which through the payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in
an amount sufficient to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on such debt securities to maturity or redemption, as the case may be, and any
mandatory sinking fund or analogous payments thereon. As a condition to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, we must deliver to the trustee an opinion
of counsel to the effect that the holders of such debt securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such legal defeasance or covenant defeasance had not occurred. Such opinion of counsel, in the case of legal defeasance under
clause (1) above, must refer to and be based upon a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or a change in applicable federal income tax law occurring after the
date of the relevant indenture. In addition, in the case of either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, we shall have delivered to the trustee (1) if
applicable, an officer's certificate to the effect that the relevant debt securities exchange(s) have informed us that neither such debt securities nor any other
debt securities of the same series, if then listed on any securities exchange, will be delisted as a result of such deposit and (2) an officer's certificate and an
opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such legal defeasance or covenant defeasance have been complied with.

We may exercise our legal defeasance option with respect to such debt securities notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance option.

**Modification and Waiver**

Under the applicable indenture, unless an accompanying prospectus supplement states otherwise, we and the applicable trustee may supplement the
indenture for certain purposes which would not materially adversely affect the interests or rights of the holders of debt securities of a series without the

15


-----

rights of the holders of debt securities with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of
each affected series issued under the indenture. However, the indenture will require the consent of each holder of debt securities that would be affected by any
modification which would:

     - reduce the principal amount of debt securities whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

     - reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any debt security or, except as provided in any prospectus supplement, alter or waive
any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of the debt securities;

     - reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any debt security;

     - waive a default or event of default in the payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on, the debt securities (except a rescission of
acceleration of the debt securities by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding debt securities
and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

     - make any debt security payable in money other than that stated in the debt securities;

     - make any change in the provisions of the applicable indenture relating to waivers of past defaults or the rights of holders of the debt securities
to receive payments of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, the debt securities;

     - waive a redemption payment with respect to any debt security (except as otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement);

     - except in connection with an offer by us to purchase all debt securities, (1) waive certain events of default relating to the payment of dividends
or (2) amend certain covenants relating to the payment of dividends and the purchase or redemption of certain equity interests;

     - release any applicable guarantor from any of its obligations under its guarantee or the indenture, except in accordance with the indenture;

     - make any change to the subordination or ranking provisions of the indenture or the related definitions that adversely affect the rights of any
holder; or

     - make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

The indenture will permit the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series issued under the
indenture which is affected by the modification or amendment to waive our compliance with certain covenants contained in the indenture.

**Payment and Paying Agents**

Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, payment of interest on a debt security on any interest payment date will be made to
the person in whose name a debt security is registered at the close of business on the applicable record date.

Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, principal, interest and premium on the debt securities of a particular series will be
payable at the office of such paying agent or paying agents as we may designate for such purpose from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at our
option, payment of any interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address appears in the security register.

16


-----

to debt securities of each series. All paying agents initially designated by us for the debt securities of a particular series will be named in the applicable
prospectus supplement. We may at any time designate additional paying agents or rescind the designation of any paying agent or approve a change in the
office through which any paying agent acts, except that we will be required to maintain a paying agent in each place of payment for the debt securities of a
particular series.

All moneys paid by us to a paying agent for the payment of the principal, interest or premium on any debt security which remain unclaimed at the end of
two years after such principal, interest or premium has become due and payable will be repaid to us upon request, and the holder of such debt security
thereafter may look only to us for payment thereof.

**Denominations, Registrations and Transfer**

Unless an accompanying prospectus supplement states otherwise, debt securities will be represented by one or more global certificates registered in the
name of a nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or DTC. In such case, each holder's beneficial interest in the global securities will be shown on the
records of DTC and transfers of beneficial interests will only be effected through DTC's records.

A holder of debt securities may only exchange a beneficial interest in a global security for certificated securities registered in the holder's name if:

     - we deliver to the trustee notice from DTC that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depository or that it is no longer a clearing agency
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and, in either case, a successor depositary is not
appointed by us within 120 days after the date of such notice from DTC;

     - we in our sole discretion determine that the debt securities (in whole but not in part) should be exchanged for definitive debt securities and
deliver a written notice to such effect to the trustee; or

     - there has occurred and is continuing a default or event of default with respect to the debt securities.

If debt securities are issued in certificated form, they will only be issued in the minimum denomination specified in the accompanying prospectus
supplement and integral multiples of such denomination. Transfers and exchanges of such debt securities will only be permitted in such minimum
denomination. Transfers of debt securities in certificated form may be registered at the trustee's corporate office or at the offices of any paying agent or trustee
appointed by us under the applicable indenture. Exchanges of debt securities for an equal aggregate principal amount of debt securities in different
denominations may also be made at such locations.

**Governing Law**

Each indenture and applicable debt securities will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without
regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.

17


-----

The trustee under each indenture will be set forth in any applicable prospectus supplement.

**Conversion or Exchange Rights**

The prospectus supplement will describe the terms, if any, on which a series of debt securities may be convertible into or exchangeable for our common
stock, preferred stock or other debt securities. These terms will include provisions as to whether conversion or exchange is mandatory, at the option of the
holder or at our option. These provisions may allow or require the number of shares of our common stock or other securities to be received by the holders of
such series of debt securities to be adjusted.

**DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS**

The following description, together with the additional information we may include in any applicable prospectus supplements, summarizes the material
terms and provisions of the warrants that we may offer under this prospectus and the related warrant agreements and warrant certificates. While the terms
summarized below will apply generally to any warrants that we may offer, we will describe the particular terms of any series of warrants in more detail in the
applicable prospectus supplement. If we so indicate in the prospectus supplement, the terms of any warrants offered under that prospectus supplement may
differ from the terms described below. Specific warrant agreements will contain additional important terms and provisions and will be incorporated by
reference into the registration statement which includes this prospectus.

**General**

We may issue warrants for the purchase of common stock, preferred stock and/or debt securities in one or more series. We may issue warrants
independently or together with common stock, preferred stock and/or debt securities, and the warrants may be attached to or separate from these securities.

We will evidence each series of warrants by warrant certificates that we may issue under a separate agreement. We may enter into the warrant agreement
with a warrant agent. Each warrant agent may be a bank that we select which has its principal office in the United States and a combined capital and surplus
of at least $50,000,000. We will indicate the name and address of any such warrant agent in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to a particular
series of warrants.

We will describe in the applicable prospectus supplement the terms of the series of warrants, including:

     - the offering price and aggregate number of warrants offered;

     - the currency for which the warrants may be purchased, if not U.S. dollars;

     - if applicable, the designation and terms of the securities with which the warrants are issued and the number of warrants issued with each such
security or each principal amount of such security;

     - if applicable, the date on and after which the warrants and the related securities will be separately transferable;

     - in the case of warrants to purchase debt securities, the principal amount of debt securities purchasable upon exercise of one warrant and the
price at, and currency, if not U.S. dollars, in which, this principal amount of debt securities may be purchased upon such exercise;

     - in the case of warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock, the number of shares of common stock or preferred stock, as the case may
be, purchasable upon the exercise of one warrant and the price at which these shares may be purchased upon such exercise;

18


-----

     - the terms of any rights to redeem or call the warrants;

     - any provisions for changes to or adjustments in the exercise price or number of securities issuable upon exercise of the warrants;

     - the dates on which the right to exercise the warrants will commence and expire;

     - the manner in which the warrant agreement and warrants may be modified;

     - federal income tax consequences of holding or exercising the warrants;

     - the terms of the securities issuable upon exercise of the warrants; and

     - any other specific terms, preferences, rights or limitations of or restrictions on the warrants.

Before exercising their warrants, holders of warrants will not have any of the rights of holders of the securities purchasable upon such exercise, including:

     - in the case of warrants to purchase debt securities, the right to receive payments of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the debt
securities purchasable upon exercise or to enforce covenants in the applicable indenture; or

     - in the case of warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock, the right to receive dividends, if any, or, payments upon our liquidation,
dissolution or winding up or to exercise voting rights, if any.

**Exercise of Warrants**

Each warrant will entitle the holder to purchase the securities that we specify in the applicable prospectus supplement at the exercise price that we
describe in the applicable prospectus supplement. Unless we otherwise specify in the applicable prospectus supplement, holders of the warrants may exercise
the warrants at any time up to 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on the expiration date that we set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. After the close of
business on the expiration date, unexercised warrants will become void.

Holders of the warrants may exercise the warrants by delivering the warrant certificate representing the warrants to be exercised together with specified
information, and paying the required amount to the warrant agent in immediately available funds, as provided in the applicable prospectus supplement. We
will set forth on the reverse side of the warrant certificate and in the applicable prospectus supplement the information that the holder of the warrant will be
required to deliver to the warrant agent.

Upon receipt of the required payment and the warrant certificate properly completed and duly executed at the corporate trust office of the warrant agent
or any other office indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will issue and deliver the securities purchasable upon such exercise. If fewer than
all of the warrants represented by the warrant certificate are exercised, then we will issue a new warrant certificate for the remaining amount of warrants. If we
so indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, holders of the warrants may surrender securities as all or part of the exercise price for warrants.

**Enforceability of Rights by Holders of Warrants**

Any warrant agent will act solely as our agent under the applicable warrant agreement and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or
trust with any holder of any warrant. A single bank or trust company may act as warrant agent for more than one issue of warrants. A warrant agent will

19


-----

any proceedings at law or otherwise, or to make any demand upon us. Any holder of a warrant may, without the consent of the related warrant agent or the
holder of any other warrant, enforce by appropriate legal action its right to exercise, and receive the securities purchasable upon exercise of, its warrants.

If a warrant holder exercises only part of the warrants represented by a single certificate, the warrant agent will issue a new warrant certificate for any
warrants not exercised. Unless the prospectus supplement states otherwise, no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of warrants, but we will pay the
cash value of any fractional shares otherwise issuable.

The exercise price and the number of shares of common stock for which each warrant can be exercised will be adjusted upon the occurrence of events
described in the warrant agreement, including the issuance of a common stock dividend or a combination, subdivision or reclassification of common stock.

Unless the prospectus supplement states otherwise, no adjustment will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in
the exercise price. From time to time, we may reduce the exercise price as may be provided in the warrant agreement.

Unless the prospectus supplement states otherwise, if we enter into any consolidation, merger, or sale or conveyance of our property as an entirety, the
holder of each outstanding warrant will have the right to acquire the kind and amount of shares, other securities, property or cash receivable by a holder of the
number of shares of common stock into which the warrants were exercisable immediately prior to the occurrence of the event.

**Modification of the Warrant Agreement**

The warrant agreements may permit us and the warrant agent, if any, without the consent of the warrant holders, to supplement or amend the agreement in
the following circumstances:

     - to cure any ambiguity;

     - to correct or supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions; or

     - to add new provisions regarding matters or questions that we and the warrant agent may deem necessary or desirable and which do not
adversely affect the interests of the warrant holders.

**DESCRIPTION OF UNITS**

We may issue units comprised of one or more of the other securities described in this prospectus in any combination. Each unit will be issued so that the
holder of the unit is also the holder of each security included in the unit. Thus, the holder of a unit will have the rights and obligations of a holder of each
included security. The unit agreement under which a unit is issued may provide that the securities included in the unit may not be held or transferred
separately, at any time or at any time before a specified date or occurrence.

The applicable prospectus supplement may describe:

     - the designation and terms of the units and of the securities comprising the units, including whether and under what circumstances those
securities may be held or transferred separately;

     - any provisions for the issuance, payment, settlement, transfer or exchange of the units or of the securities comprising the units; and

     - whether the units will be issued in fully-registered or global form.

20


-----

prospectus supplement does not purport to be complete and is subject to and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the unit agreement and, if applicable,
collateral arrangements and depository arrangements relating to such units.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

We may sell the securities described in this prospectus through underwriters or dealers, through agents, or directly to one or more purchasers or through a
combination of these methods. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the terms of the offering of the securities, including:

     - the name or names of any underwriters and, if required, any dealers or agents;

     - the purchase price of the securities and the proceeds we will receive from the sale;

     - any underwriting discounts and other items constituting underwriters' compensation;

     - any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers; and

     - any securities exchange or market on which the securities may be listed.

We may distribute the securities from time to time in one or more transactions at:

     - a fixed price or prices, which may be changed;

     - market prices prevailing at the time of sale;

     - varying prices determined at the time of sale related to such prevailing market prices; or

     - negotiated prices.

Offerings of our equity securities pursuant to this prospectus may also be made into an existing trading market for such securities in transactions at other
than a fixed price, either:

     - on or through the facilities of any national securities exchange or quotation service on which such securities may be listed or quoted at the
time of sale; or

     - to or through a market maker otherwise than on such exchanges.

Such at-the-market offerings will be conducted by underwriters acting as our principal or agent, who may also be third-party sellers of securities as described
above.

Only underwriters named in the prospectus supplement will be underwriters of the securities offered by the prospectus supplement. If we use underwriters
in the sale, they will acquire the securities for their own account and may resell the securities from time to time in one or more transactions, including
negotiated transactions, at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. We may offer the securities to the public through
underwriting syndicates represented by managing underwriters or by underwriters without a syndicate. Any public offering price and any discounts or
concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers may change from time to time.

We may sell the securities directly. In this case, no underwriters or agents would be involved. We may also sell the securities through agents we designate
from time to time. We will name any agent involved in the offering and sale of securities and we will describe any commissions we will pay the agent in the
prospectus supplement.

We may authorize agents or underwriters to solicit offers by institutional investors to purchase securities from us at the public offering price set forth in
the prospectus supplement pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on a specified date in the future. We will describe the
conditions to these contracts and the commissions we must pay for solicitation of these contracts in the prospectus supplement.

21


-----

     - purchases by a dealer, as principal, who may then resell those securities to the public for its account at varying prices determined by the dealer
at the time of resale;

     - block trades in which a dealer will attempt to sell as agent, but may position or resell a portion of the block, as principal, in order to facilitate
the transaction; or

     - ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which a broker-dealer solicits purchasers.

We will include in the applicable prospectus supplement the names of any dealers and the terms of the transaction.

In connection with the sale of the securities, underwriters, dealers or agents may receive compensation from us or from purchasers of the securities for
whom they act as agents in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions. Underwriters may sell the securities to or through dealers, and those dealers
may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters or commissions from the purchasers for whom they
may act as agents. Underwriters, dealers and agents that participate in the distribution of the securities, and any institutional investors or others that purchase
securities directly and then resell the securities, may be deemed to be underwriters, and any discounts or commissions received by them from us and any
profit on the resale of the securities by them may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act).

We may provide agents and underwriters with indemnification against particular civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or
contribution with respect to payments that the agents or underwriters may make with respect to such liabilities. Agents and underwriters may engage in
transactions with, or perform services for, us in the ordinary course of business.

In addition, we may enter into derivative transactions with third parties (including the writing of options), or sell securities not covered by this
prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. If the applicable prospectus supplement indicates, in connection with such a transaction, the
third parties may, pursuant to this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, sell securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable
prospectus supplement. If so, the third party may use securities borrowed from us or others to settle such sales and may use securities received from us to close
out any related short positions. We may also loan or pledge securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement to third parties,
who may sell the loaned securities or, in an event of default in the case of a pledge, sell the pledged securities pursuant to this prospectus and the applicable
prospectus supplement. The third party in such sale transactions will be an underwriter and will be identified in the applicable prospectus supplement or in a
post-effective amendment.

Offered securities may also be offered and sold, if so indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, in connection with a remarketing upon their
purchase, in accordance with a redemption or repayment pursuant to their terms, or otherwise, by one or more remarketing firms, acting as principals for their
own accounts or as agents for us. Any remarketing firm will be identified and the terms of its agreements, if any, with us and its compensation will be
described in the applicable prospectus supplement.

To facilitate an offering of a series of securities, persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain, or otherwise
affect the market price of the securities. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involves the sale by persons participating in
the offering of more securities than have been sold to them by us. In those circumstances, such persons would cover such over-allotments or short positions
by purchasing in the open market or by exercising the over-allotment option granted to those persons. In addition, those persons may stabilize

22


-----

allowed to underwriters or dealers participating in any such offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with
stabilization transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level above that which might
otherwise prevail in the open market. Such transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. We make no representation or prediction as to the
direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above, if implemented, may have on the price of our securities.

Some or all of the securities that we offer through this prospectus may be new issues of securities with no established trading market. Any underwriters to
whom we sell our securities for public offering and sale may make a market in those securities, but they will not be obligated to do so and they may
discontinue any market making at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the liquidity of, or continued trading markets for, any
securities that we offer.

**LEGAL MATTERS**

In connection with particular offerings of our securities in the future, unless otherwise stated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the validity of
those securities will be passed upon for us by Dechert LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. If the securities are being distributed in an underwritten offering,
certain legal matters will be passed upon for the underwriters by counsel identified in the related prospectus supplement.
