(a) QIBs; or

(b) not U.S. persons and are outside the United States and that the electronic mail address that you
gave us and to which the offering memorandum has been delivered is not located in the United

American Samoa, Wake Island and the Northern Mariana Islands), any State of the United
States or the District of Columbia; and

(3) if you are resident in a Member State of the EEA, or a resident in the United Kingdom, you are a
qualified investor.

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the sellers of the Securities will be relying on the
exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities
Act.

You are reminded that the offering memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person
into whose possession the offering memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the offering
memorandum to any other person. You may not transmit the offering memorandum (or any copy of it or part
thereof) or disclose, whether orally or in writing, any of its contents to any other person except with the consent
of the Initial Purchasers.

The offering memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of transmission and, consequently,
none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls an Initial Purchaser, the issuer of the Securities (the
“Issuer”), or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, employer, employee or agent of
theirs, or affiliate of any such person, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any
difference between the offering memorandum distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version
available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

The materials relating to the offering of the Securities (the “Offering”) do not constitute, and may not be used
in connection with, an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the Securities
in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. If a jurisdiction requires that the
Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial
Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the Offering shall be deemed to be made by the
Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction.

The offering memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom. The
Securities may not be offered or sold other than to persons whose ordinary activities involve these persons in
acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (as principal or agent) for the purposes of their
businesses or who it is reasonable to expect will acquire, hold, manage or dispose of investments (as principal
or agent) for the purposes of their businesses where the issue of the Securities would otherwise constitute a
contravention of Section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) by us. In addition,
no person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue
or sale of the Securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us.

**MIFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the**
purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Securities is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The
target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local


-----

regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK MIFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the**
purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Securities, taking into account the five categories referred to in item 18 of the Guidelines published by the
European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on 5 February 2018 (in accordance with the FCA’s
policy statement entitled “Brexit our approach to EU non-legislative materials”), has led to the conclusion that:
(i) the target market for the Securities is eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of
Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate.
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Securities (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance
Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The Securities are not intended to be**
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any
retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as
defined in Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Securities
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore, offering or
selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful
under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Securities in any Member State
of the EEA that is subject to the EU Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
EU Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. The
offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the EU Prospectus Regulation.

**UK PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The Securities are not intended to be**
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any
“retail investor” in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of
the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, “FSMA”) and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the
UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No.
1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering
or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared, and
therefore, offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

The offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Securities in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of securities. The offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK
Prospectus Regulation.

that may be guaranteed, or in respect of which security interests may be provided as well as the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security securing the Notes and the Guarantees. For

pursuant to Rule 144A. The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under
the Securities Act and the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold within the United
States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” The Notes and the Guarantees have not
been reviewed or recommended by any U.S. federal or state securities commission or regulatory
authority. Furthermore, the foregoing authorities have not passed upon the merits of the Offering or

**United Kingdom**

This offering memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in
matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are
persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (high net worth companies, unincorporated associations,
etc.) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to
whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21

**UK MIFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely**
for the purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes, taking into account the five categories referred to in item 18 of the Guidelines
published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on 5 February 2018 (in
accordance with the FCA’s policy statement entitled “Brexit our approach to EU non-legislative
materials”), has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product
Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**UK PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The securities described in**
the offering memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any “retail investor” in the UK. For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in
point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8)
of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the


-----

EUWA, or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
securities described in the offering memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK has been prepared, and therefore, offering or selling the securities described in the
offering memorandum or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

For the purposes of the foregoing, the expression “offering” includes the communication in any form
and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as
to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will
be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of securities. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of
the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**European Economic Area**

**MIFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for**
the purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties
and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and
(ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the
EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration
the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible
for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The Notes are not intended to be**
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”),
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore, offering or selling the Notes
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

For the purposes of the foregoing, the expression “offering” includes the communication in any form
and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as
to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member
State of the EEA that is subject to the EU Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant to an
exemption under the EU Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of the securities. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the EU
Prospectus Regulation.

This offering memorandum contains and refers to certain forward-looking statements with respect to
our financial condition, results of operations and business. Forward-looking statements are statements
of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and

events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking
statements include, among others, statements concerning the potential exposure to market risks and
statements expressing management’s expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, estimates,
forecasts, projections and assumptions. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or

“seek,” “target” and other words of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future
operating or financial performance. All of these forward-looking statements are based on estimates

uncertain. Therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon any forward-looking statements.
There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contemplated by such forward-looking statements. In addition, even if our actual results are consistent

    - political and economic uncertainty;

    - our ability to capitalize on secondary rights to the content we produce;

    - labor disputes;

    - our shareholding structure;

    - our ability to implement our business strategy;

    - our ability to benefit from audiovisual production subsidies and tax incentives;

    - the impact of changes in tax laws or challenges to the Group’s tax position;

    - goodwill impairment; and

    - other risks associated with our indebtedness, the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral.

The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive. We urge you to read this offering
memorandum, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry” and “Business” for a more_
complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry in which
we operate.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement. We undertake
no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to in this section and contained elsewhere in this
offering memorandum, including those set forth under “Risk Factors.” In light of these risks, our
results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this offering
memorandum.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “IFRS” herein are to
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**Historical Financial Information**

All historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is that of Banijay and its
consolidated subsidiaries (including the Issuer). Unless otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,”
“our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information herein are to Banijay and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

In this offering memorandum, we have included the following historical consolidated financial
statements:

- the unaudited historical interim consolidated financial statements of Banijay and the notes thereto
as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 (the “Unaudited Interim Financial Statements”),
prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting
(“IAS 34”). The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements include unaudited comparative
information as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements have been reviewed by our statutory auditors, Ernst & Young et Autres; and

- the audited historical consolidated financial statements of Banijay and the notes thereto, prepared
in accordance with IFRS, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (the
“Audited Financial Statements” and, together with the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements,
the “Financial Statements”). The Audited Financial Statements have been audited by our statutory
auditors, Ernst & Young et Autres. Their audit reports are included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum, together with the Audited Financial Statements.

The historical consolidated financial information of Banijay as of and for the year ended December
31, 2020 presented in this offering memorandum is derived from the prior-year comparative figures
included in the Audited Financial Statements of Banijay as of and for the year ended December 31,
2021. See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the reports of the statutory auditors of Banijay
on the Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates and judgments. These standards require management to exercise its judgment in
the process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial
statements, are disclosed in the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum
and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Our Financial Statements are presented in euro.

We have included the historical consolidated financial information of Banijay in this offering
memorandum rather than that of the Issuer because we report our consolidated financial condition and
results of operations for the Group on an ongoing basis at the level of Banijay. Banijay is a holding
company that has no revenue-generating activities of its own, no business operations, material assets
or liabilities other than in connection with holding company expenses, debt service costs and the
Group long-term incentive plan. Banijay is also the issuer of the Existing Senior Notes.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the
applicable accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of
the SEC, which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC.

**Financial Information Presented for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023**

Unless otherwise indicated, and other than for percentages and ratios, the financial information of
Banijay for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, represents the mathematical calculation of
subtracting the applicable financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2022 from the
applicable financial information for the year ended December 31, 2022, and adding the applicable
financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The financial information of Banijay
for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not
required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting
principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. This information is not necessarily
representative of our results of operations for such a period or any future period or any financial
position at any past or future date.

The contents of any website, including the websites of the Issuer or any member or affiliate of the
Group, do not form any part of this offering memorandum.

**2020 Restatement**

In the Audited Financial Statements, the consolidated statement of financial position as of December
31, 2020, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the consolidated statement of cash flows
and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in each
case derived from the prior-year comparative figures included in the Audited Financial Statements of
Banijay as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021), were restated to give retrospective effect to
a change in the accounting treatment for acquisition instruments with a lock-up mechanism. Pursuant
to such change, put options over minority interests in the context of a business combination that
include a lock-up mechanism are to be treated as remuneration of the employees or former owners of
the acquired entity for services rendered, rather than as consideration for the business combination.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key
_Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Changes to Accounting Standards_
_and Policies—2020 Restatement.” For ease of comparison, we present financial data reflecting this_
restatement when comparing information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, with
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. See note 5.4 to the Audited Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This offering memorandum contains non-IFRS measures and ratios, including Run-Rate Revenues,
EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted
Free Cash Flow, cash conversion ratio, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA
margin, and other measures and ratios that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS
or any other generally accepted accounting principles. We present non-IFRS measures for illustrative
purposes only because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors,
securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.
These non-IFRS measures and ratios, such as Run-Rate Revenues, EBITDA, EBITDA margin,
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, cash
conversion ratio, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA margin and other
measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not
be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or any other performance
measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as
alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. The non-IFRS measures and
ratios we present in this offering memorandum have not been audited or reviewed and should not be
relied upon when making an investment decision.

Run-Rate Revenues and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA have been calculated in reliance on
management accounts, financial due diligence reports and/or audited and unaudited financial
statements of the acquired companies. Run-Rate Revenues and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are not


-----

required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting
principles and have been prepared for illustrative purposes only. These amounts have not been, and, in
certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This
information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete
picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired businesses, may not be
comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this
offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision.

We present a reconciliation of the non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable measure
calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS under “Summary—Summary Historical Financial
_Information and Other Information.”_

The non-IFRS measures we present may also be defined differently from the corresponding terms
under the Indenture. The non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be
considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or a substitute for, operating profit or profit for the
period or any other financial statement data presented in our consolidated financial statements as
indicators or financial performance. Some of the limitations of these non-IFRS measures are that:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service
interest or principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect our tax expenses or the cash that we may be required to use in order to pay
taxes;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our or
statements of cash flows;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider
not to be indicative of our ongoing operations;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA-based measures do not reflect
any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements;

- some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA-based measures
reflect cash payments that were made, or will be made in the future; and

- certain adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA
contain estimates that our management believes reflect the underlying results of operations and
are therefore subjective in nature.

Furthermore, you should carefully consider the risks and limitations of the non-IFRS financial
measures, as they are based in part on our management’s assumptions regarding the future impact of
actions that have not yet been implemented. For example, there is a risk that the synergies that we
seek to achieve may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe and that the magnitude of cost
savings may be less than expected.

**As adjusted financial information**

We present in this offering memorandum certain as adjusted financial information including but not
limited to: as adjusted net senior secured debt, as adjusted net financial debt and as adjusted net
interest expense and related ratios and as adjusted cash and cash equivalents, which are based on our


-----

consolidated financial information on an as adjusted basis to reflect certain effects of the Transactions
(as defined herein) on our indebtedness, cash position and interest expense as of and for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2023. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other
_Information—Other Financial Information.” This adjusted financial information has been prepared_
for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our actual interest expense would have been
had the Transactions occurred on July 1, 2022, or what our actual cash position, indebtedness or
secured indebtedness would have been had the Transactions occurred on July 1, 2022, nor does it
purport to project our indebtedness, cash position or interest expense at any future date. The adjusted
financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X
under the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation, IFRS or any
generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the
resulting as adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set forth in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in
millions or thousands and percentages, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the
totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of
such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial
and other data set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations” are calculated using the numerical data in the consolidated financial statements_
of Banijay, or the tabular presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this offering
memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

**Currency Presentation**

In this offering memorandum, all references to “euro,” “EUR” and “€” are to the single currency of
the Member States participating in the third stage of economic and monetary union pursuant to the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as amended or supplemented from time to time; all

**Overview**

We are the world’s leading independent producer and distributor of content based on revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2022. We are also the world’s leading independent producer and distributor
of content in terms of hours of content as of June 30, 2023. We develop, produce and distribute
television formats and programs and digital content for a wide range of customers. We operate over
130 production companies across 21 countries and have a multi-genre catalogue boasting over
172,000 hours of content. We have produced successful, and at times, long-running scripted and nonscripted formats and programs, such as _Survivor, Temptation Island, Peaky Blinders, Big Brother,_
_MasterChef, Rogue Heroes, Hunted, Black Mirror, LEGO Masters, Deal or No Deal, Grantchester,_
_Don’t Forget The Lyrics!, Marie Antoinette, Fort Boyard, Versailles, Mr. Bean and_ _Good Karma_
_Hospital. Our broad brand portfolio and large creative platform position us to continue to nurture and_
drive new formats for broadcasters and digital platforms.

We generate revenues through (i) the production of formats and programs; (ii) the distribution of
formats and programs for which we hold and/or control intellectual property rights and are entitled to
revenues generated by such formats and programs and (iii) commercial activities related to our brands
and programs, such as merchandising, sponsorship, licensing, digital partnerships, music and live
events. We produce both scripted and non-scripted content across all genres, including reality,
entertainment and talk shows, game shows, factual entertainment, documentary, drama, animation (or
kids) and comedy. Non-scripted content includes titles that do not follow a written storyline (for
example, entertainment, game shows or reality) and generated the majority of our revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2022, while scripted content includes programs that follow a written
scenario, which mainly consists of drama and comedy.

We own intellectual property rights to a broad and diversified portfolio of formats and programs, and
we generated the majority of our production revenues from our owned intellectual property for the
year ended December 31, 2022. The programs we own and/or control were distributed and licensed,
through our subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited, to approximately 1,050 licensees, including linear
broadcasters and digital platforms worldwide, and we sold our products into 249 territories, in each
case for the year ended December 31, 2022. We retain (either through full ownership or control
pursuant to long-term and exclusive distribution contracts with third-party producers) the intellectual
property rights to most of our formats and programs. Such intellectual property rights are assets that
we generally distribute internationally and from which we seek to generate secondary revenues, such
as licensing of exploitation rights to broadcasters and digital platforms and sales of finished tapes and
branded content, in each case to supplement our initial production revenues.

We employ creative talents across all territories in which we operate in order to develop original
formats and produce original television programs based on our analysis of trends in the industry and
the demands of our customers. Thanks to our significant scale and the scope of our business, we have
access to a wide variety of industry-leading talents worldwide and high-quality creative content. For
the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated €3,242 million of revenues, of which €2,676
million (or 83% of total revenues) were production revenues, €413 million (or 12% of total revenues)


-----

were distribution revenues and €153 million (or 5% of total revenues) were secondary revenues. For
the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our Run-Rate Revenues was €3,609 million, our Run-Rate
Adjusted EBITDA was €544 million and our Adjusted Free Cash Flow was €347 million.

**Our Strengths**

We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and provide us with
competitive advantages in the markets in which we operate:

**_World’s Leading Independent Content Producer and Distributor_**

We are the world’s leading independent producer and distributor of content based on revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2022, as well as catalogue depth in the independent production sector, with
an unmatched library of over 172,000 hours of content as of June 30, 2023. The following graphic
shows the revenues and catalogue depth of the producers that we consider to be our main competitors:

______________

(1) Represents data as of December 31, 2022 for Banijay, and latest available market data for other players.

(2) Excludes major U.S. studios such as Disney and Warner Brothers, as well as independent players such as MGM and Lionsgate.

While the global content spend market represented approximately $238 billion as of December 31,
2022, according to Ampere, the top players mentioned in the graphic above represented
approximately 8% of that market, reflecting a long tail-end of smaller players in the sector and the
overall fragmented nature of the industry. Within this largely fragmented content production
landscape, we are well positioned as a global leader benefitting from an international, independent
studio and a largely de-risked business model, underpinned by a cost-plus pricing base of our
productions wherein customers finance the entire production costs for most non-scripted shows. The
following graphic shows the characteristics of the main types of players in the global content spend
market:


-----

Our leading position as the largest international independent studio positions us favorably in
comparison with other business models within the content production landscape. This landscape
mainly comprises (i) in-house production departments of SVOD operators and broadcasters (e.g.
Netflix and Apple), which have less independence, (ii) major U.S. studios (e.g. Comcast, Disney,
Lionsgate, Paramount and Sony), which operate a vertical, riskier business model, (iii) smaller
independent players, which tend to have niche, sub-scale operations lacking critical size, in addition to
(iv) independent studios with scale such as the Group. Our favorable positioning within this
competitive landscape ensures that we benefit from a largely de-risked business model as well as from
scale and independence, allowing us to optimally roll our existing successful content and new
upcoming releases across geographies, formats and distribution partners.

**_Attractive Market with Growing Demand for Content Driven by SVOD Platforms_**

We continue to operate in a global and attractive market characterized by stable growth, which has
proven to be resilient, including throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the last ten years, global
content spend has almost doubled in absolute terms, as demonstrated by the following graphic:

The growth in global content spend is expected to continue to be driven largely by the surging
demand from SVOD platforms, which is expected to grow by more than 21% per year from 2020 to
2025, as demonstrated by the following graphic:


-----

In addition, SVOD platforms have recently increased their exposure to non-scripted content, with the
number of non-scripted shows on SVOD platforms in the United States more than tripling over the
last three years from 125 shows in 2019 to 397 shows in 2022. We believe that we are well positioned
to benefit from this trend thanks to our strong non-scripted production capabilities, which allow us to
produce formats in a hub model for SVOD in several countries. Broadcaster demand has also
remained resilient, despite increasing pressures on advertising revenues.

**_Platform Agnostic and Highly Diversified Revenue Base Across Geographies, Genres, Customers_**
**_and Shows_**

We are a global producer and distributor of content, generating revenues in 21 countries, including 14
countries in Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Nordic Countries, Poland,
Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), three countries in the Americas (Brazil,
Mexico and the United States), three countries in the Asia Pacific region (Australia, India and New
Zealand) and one country in the rest of the world (Israel). For the twelve months ended June 2023,
48% of our revenues were generated in Europe, 31% in the Americas and 21% in the rest of the
world. Thanks to our broad portfolio of successful formats and programs that can be adapted to a
variety of audiences across multiple geographies, we believe we are well-positioned to maintain and
grow our share in our current markets. Our distribution business enables us to license our portfolio of
formats and programs around the world, including to customers located in markets in which we do not
currently maintain production operations. Notably, our catalogue of non-scripted content (including
our “super brands”) is available in a broad range of non-English languages, allowing us to capitalize
on the growth of streaming platforms outside of the U.S. and to reach audiences globally.

We work with a broad network of customers and partners, including broadcasters, television channels,
producers and digital platforms active in the markets in which we operate, as well as with licensees,
retailers of consumer products and commercial partners from around the world. Our main production
customers include broadcasters such as France Télévisions, TF1 Group, ITV, the BBC, Channel 4
Television, FOX, CBS, Bravo, Antena 3, TVE, Channel 5, RTL Group, TV2 Denmark, NENT, DR
Denmark, TV4 Sweden, SKY, Mediaset, Rai Uno, Canal Plus Group, ABC Network, NBC,
Discovery and MTV. We are also platform agnostic, which allows us to nurture relationships with
numerous digital platforms, including SVOD providers (such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video,
Disney+, Discovery+, HBO Max, Paramount+ and Peacock) and AVOD platforms (such as Globo,
Pluto and Freevee). For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 18% of our total revenues
were generated from OTT players, an increase of approximately 10% compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our eight biggest customers contributed
to 43% of our total production revenues, with none of our customers individually contributing to more
than 12% of our total revenues during the same period. In addition, we often have multiple contracts,
which address multiple formats and geographies, with individual customers. Similarly, our top 15
shows collectively contributed to 17% of our production revenues for the year ended December 31,
2022, with none of our shows individually contributing to more than 2% of our production revenues
during the same period. The following graphics show, for the year ended December 31, 2022, our
production revenues (i) by top customers and (ii) by top shows:


-----

**Production Revenues by Customers** **Production Revenues by Shows**

Although we have historically focused on developing non-scripted formats across various genres, we
have also significantly expanded our scripted activity to meet our customers’ and the market’s
increasing demand for scripted content. For the year ended December 31, 2022, non-scripted content
generated €2,134 million, or 80%, of our production revenues, with the remaining €531 million, or
20%, generated by scripted content, which we believe is generally the appropriate mix for our
operations. The following graphics show, for the year ended December 31, 2022, our production
revenues by (i) genre, and (ii) geography:

**Production Revenues by Genre** **Production Revenues by Geography**

**_Proven Ability to Develop Long-Lasting Worldwide Brands Generating Primary and Secondary_**
**_Revenues_**

We have a proven track record of producing and distributing long-lasting and travelling content (i.e.,
formatted content which can be adapted by our companies worldwide), which have become durable
“super brands”. We define such “super brands” as premium unscripted formats with robust returning
appeal across at least ten different markets with significant production budgets, and which are
profitable in the context of a large-scale distribution. We are the content producer that has adapted the
most unscripted formats globally, such as Deal or No Deal (launched in 2002, and adapted in over 80
territories), Big Brother (launched in 1999, and adapted in over 70 territories), MasterChef (launched
in 1990, and adapted in over 60 territories) and Minute to Win It (launched in 2010, and adapted in
over 50 territories). We have increasingly focused on formats that, once produced for one market, can
be licensed internationally to reach customers in other markets. For the year ended December 31,
2022, our top travelling formats were MasterChef (active in 39 territories), Big Brother (active in 33
territories), _Survivor (active in 21 territories) and_ _LEGO Masters (active in 15 territories). The_
following table shows a breakdown of some of our most successful long-lasting and travelling
programs and formats by (i) genre, (ii) number of active years since launch, (iii) country of origin, (iv)
total number of territories since launch (which represents the number of format adaptations for nonscripted shows and licensing of finished tapes for scripted shows) and (v) customers:


-----

Our diversified portfolio of long-standing and travelling formats and programs is supported by “360degree” monetization of our formats and programs. This approach allows us to monetize our content
from the production of new formats and programs to be sold to broadcasters and digital platforms, to
the licensing of existing formats to third parties and the sale of programs to generate distribution
revenues and leverage our strong brands to create secondary revenues through commercial activities
such as merchandising, sponsorship, digital partnerships, music and live events. The following
graphic shows our revenues by business type (production, distribution and other, excluding
intercompany revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2022:

**Revenues by Genre**

We generate the majority of our revenues from our owned intellectual property, which provides us
with exclusivity and control on the worldwide production and distribution of our owned formats and
programs, as well as the further potential to generate secondary revenues from the programs and
formats for which we own intellectual property rights. In addition, our distribution and secondary
revenues businesses generate high margins, providing royalties to production companies and owners
of intellectual property rights, as we incur limited direct costs to maintain our library of programs.
The following graphic illustrates how our 360-monetization strategy operates across scripted and nonscripted content:


-----

**_Strong Track Record of Successfully Integrating Value Accretive Acquisitions_**

We have a history of successfully pursuing various selective and value-enhancing strategic
acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures intended to complement and/or expand our
business. We regularly pursue value-accretive bolt-on acquisitions to acquire production companies
and/or intellectual property rights in the markets where we are present. Thanks to these acquisitions,
we are able to expand into new markets or genres in a particular market, access new talent, acquire
intellectual property rights of formats and programs developed by such companies and benefit from
the expertise of their creative talents or producers. Some of our most recent acquisitions and
significant investments include Beyond in Australia in December 2022, A Fábrica in Brazil in March
2023, Twenty Two Productions in the Netherlands in March 2023, as well as our joint venture with
LaLiga in Spain in June 2023. Further, in June 2023, we agreed to acquire a controlling stake in
Balich, an Italian live entertainment business in charge of creating, producing and delivering live
shows and experiences that engage live audiences worldwide, active in 20 countries, in line with our
strategy to expand our live event activities. The following timeline shows our bolt-on acquisitions
made during the development of our business:

We also have a proven track record of successfully integrating large groups and implementing
synergies within a short period of time following transformative acquisitions. For example, in 2020,
the completion of the Endemol Shine Acquisition allowed us to become the leading independent
player in Europe with the highest number of scripted content launches in 2022, thereby gaining the
scale necessary to address the strong appetite in our industry for globally distributed brands. Thanks
to the successful integration of Endemol Shine into the Group, we benefitted from structural
simplification, commercial synergies, IT integration, footprint optimization and rationalization of
third-party service providers, and realized cost synergies of approximately €67 million within a period
of 18 months, exceeding the originally projected cost synergies of approximately €60 million within
24 months. Our net leverage ratio as of September 30, 2019, after giving effect to the Endemol Shine
Acquisition, the financing arrangements entered in connection therewith and the use of proceeds
therefrom, was 5.2x. We have since successfully reduced our total net leverage and are on track to
further reduce it (exclusive of acquisitions that may be consummated (other than the Balich
Acquisition), in the medium term).

We are also focused on pursuing strategic joint ventures, which allow us to be involved in the early
stages of potential successes and, in the long term, to secure the possibility of acquiring a controlling
interest in the underlying company for a price based on a pre-existing formula that takes into account
our investment and support. Since 2018, we have also established several joint ventures in the United
Kingdom and the United States, the most active markets for international scripted shows, including
recent investments in Rabbit Track, Conker and Immovable in the United Kingdom. We also have
successful joint ventures in Mexico, such as Endemol Shine Boomdog, which was formed in 2018 to
capitalize on the growing opportunities in the Mexican and U.S Spanish-language markets.


-----

Thanks to our successful acquisition track-record, we have been able to grow our platform globally,
positioning us well to serve an increasingly global customer base, including OTT players who can
deploy our formats into multiple geographies. We believe that in a fragmented and competitive
industry, our significant scale allows us to increase our leverage when negotiating with broadcasters
and SVOD platforms, diversify our portfolio by introducing new cross-selling opportunities, increase
our financial capacity to fund a large number of formats, offer more competitive production budgets
by leveraging on combined resources and attract and retain talent.

**_A Cash Generative and Resilient Business Model Supported by a Recurring Revenue Base, Strong_**
**_Financial Performance, Cash Flow Visibility and a Flexible Cost Structure_**

Our portfolio of long-standing “super brands,” such as Big Brother, MasterChef, Survivor and
Temptation Island, allows us to benefit from strong and long-term recurring revenues, with 43% of
our production revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 derived from content that has been
running for at least five consecutive seasons, 30% from content that has been running for two to five
consecutive seasons, and only 28% from new launches. Certain of our production companies, such as
Banijay Production Media, Adventure Line Productions and Bunim/Murray Productions have
produced television content for more than 20 years, and we benefit from their long-standing
relationships with broadcasters and other customers. We believe that our ability to propose original
formats with a cost-efficient production process has increased customer loyalty. We have further
expanded our customer base and captured business opportunities associated with the rise of SVOD
providers by developing relationships with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Discovery+,
HBO Max, Paramount+ and Peacock.

Over the last three years, we have achieved significant Adjusted EBITDA improvement, which has
grown from €262 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €482 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. Following our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, our Adjusted EBITDA
margin levels normalized to 15% for the year ended December 31, 2022, demonstrating resilience
against inflation thanks to our cost-plus pricing-based business model, which allows us to pass on a
significant amount of incremental costs to our customers. This is higher than the average EBITDA
margin over the last three years of the producers that we consider to be our main competitors. We
have also reduced our leverage and maintained strong cash generation, with Adjusted Free Cash Flow
ranging from €256 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €349 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. Our average cash conversion ratio for the same period was 83.2%, due in 2020 to
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our production, tax and social security payments, and in
2021 to a favorable working capital cut-off effect at the end of the year and the normalization of our
production activities after the COVID-19 pandemic.We intend to continue to implement our
acquisition schemes based on earn-outs and put options in order to limit our cash interest expense.

We believe we have a largely de-risked business model. Our revenue benefits from the longevity of
our returning formats, such as Survivor, Big Brother, _MasterChef and Deal or No Deal. The majority_
of our formats air for more than one season, which generates long-term revenue streams and
significant visibility into our operating performance as we secure budgeted revenues through contracts
signed early in the production process, and some of our returning formats benefit from multi-season
deals with broadcasters and digital platforms. These formats continue to be successful, for instance
with the 24[th] season of _Big Brother being viewed for approximately 8.3 billion minutes across all_
platforms in two months, with particular success in the U.S., and Survivor airing 25 series across 24
territories. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 28% and 73% of the Group’s production revenues
were generated by new and returning programs, respectively (of which 43% had been running for at
least five consecutive seasons, and 30% for two to five consecutive seasons). As of June 30, 2023, we
had already secured at least 84% of our estimated revenues for the year ending December 31, 2023.
Our business model is also supported by a stable level of content spend, which has been resilient
during economic downturns, as compared to advertisement spend. We have retained our competitive
advantage despite increasing pressures on advertising revenues, thanks to our focus on less expensive
non-scripted content, performing “super brands” that are pillars of traditional broadcasters and costefficient production plans.


-----

We only commence the production for a program once a broadcaster or digital platform has agreed to
pay for the production and acquisition of the rights for such program, and the production costs have
been fully funded. We use the services of a significant number of freelance production artists and
technicians, depending on the level of television production activity in which we are engaged. Such
freelancers allow us to benefit from a flexible cost structure pursuant to which we can adjust our cost
base to the seasonality of production activity throughout the year. We estimate that approximately
80% of our cost structure is flexible. In addition, we attract, retain and incentivize talents via longterm incentive plans which are generally contingent and calculated based on the performance of the
relevant format over a specified time period. Therefore, our production costs and a significant share of
our staff costs are based on our performance and activity levels and are variable in nature.

We operate an asset-light model with limited ongoing capital expenditure requirements (representing
1.8% of revenues, including investments in intellectual property rights, for the year ended December
31, 2022), and low working capital requirements. Non-scripted programs are generally less capitalintensive and more profitable than scripted programs because they have shorter production cycles and
their budgeted production costs are covered in full before production begins. We believe that our mix
of scripted and non-scripted content is generally appropriate for our operations. In the event that we
seek to increase the proportion of our revenues generated by scripted programs, we do not anticipate
having to invest significantly as we expect that third-party financing sources will largely incur the
required upfront investment costs and that we will benefit from our existing catalogue’s distribution
revenues. In addition, we continuously promote financial discipline to maximize cash generation and
monitor our leverage.

**_Highly Experienced and Committed Management Team with Supportive Shareholders_**

The Group has a highly experienced and professional senior management team, consisting of
Stéphane Courbit, Chairman and founder of Banijay, Marco Bassetti, Chief Executive Officer, and
Cédric Brignon, Chief Financial Officer. Both Stéphane Courbit and Marco Bassetti have a successful
track record of television content production. Since 2007, Banijay has become a leading independent
producer of television programs based on revenues. Our management team has a proven track record
of delivering on their budget and has demonstrated strong M&A capabilities, successfully integrating
new businesses into the Group such as the Banijay Zodiak Merger (realizing cost synergies of
approximately €17 million within a period of 10 months) and the Endemol Shine Acquisition
(realizing cost synergies of approximately €67 million within a period of 18 months, exceeding the
originally projected cost synergies of approximately €60 million within 24 months). During the year
ended December 31, 2022, we successfully completed 15 bolt-on acquisition in ten different
countries. Unlike some of our competitors, the Group is led by industry experts who understand our
creative talents and local production managers. This common culture and vision between our
management team and our creative talents have allowed us to attract and retain successful managers,
employees and partners. Furthermore, we benefit from the full support of our shareholders, including
DeA and Vivendi, two groups with a history of investing in the distribution of content and
broadcasters. LOV Group and Vivendi are industry experts who understand the television production
and distribution business and are focused on developing original content. While most of the largest
television content producers in the world are affiliated with an entertainment group or a distribution
network, we remain independent, which enables us to serve customers without the limitations faced
by controlled producers regarding, for example, the content, style and format of their production. Our
independence allows us to innovate, deliver original, differentiated programs, be platform agnostic
and work with and retain a large pool of creative talents. In addition, as a scaled independent
producer, we benefit from competitive advantages compared to the in-house departments of
broadcasters and U.S. studios in Europe, which favor European independent producers.

We believe we are positioned at the forefront of content production and distribution as a premier
home for the industry’s leading on- and off-screen talent, and pride ourselves upon our ability to
attract, grow and retain top creative talent, including creative talent, producers, screenwriters and
directors. We have a number of key initiatives in place in order to further promote workforce
retention. In connection with the acquisition of production companies in various jurisdictions, we


-----

typically enter into earn-out or put option agreements with certain managers and creative talents of
these companies in order to incentivize them to continue to work with us following the completion of
the relevant acquisition. Our management has also implemented a long-term incentive plan to ensure
the commitment of local management teams by rewarding key personnel based on their respective
value creation. In addition, our corporate organization is designed to foster creative freedom,
collaborative entrepreneurialism and commercial acumen. As a responsible employer, we are aware of
the rapid changes in lifestyles and ways of living of our employees, particularly following the
COVID-19 pandemic, and we actively seek to contribute to the improvement of our employees’
quality of life to maintain long, successful and trusting relationships. We have chosen to improve our
employee experience through the implementation of selective remote-working policies to help reduce
commuting stress, free up time and stay competitive in the talent war. We have also committed to
building diverse, supportive and collaborative teams through the development of our global diversity
& inclusion board and employee resource groups.

**Our Strategies**

We intend to further strengthen our business by focusing on the following key strategic objectives.

**_Continue to Create Premium International Content and Secure Intellectual Property Rights_**

Our goal is to continue to focus on high premium formats and programs that can travel to other
territories and be easily distributed globally to broadcasters and digital platforms looking for new
content, such as _Survivor,_ _Big Brother,_ _MasterChef and_ _Deal or No Deal. Through our dedicated_
distribution subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited, we intend to leverage our know-how on successfully
selling or licensing our catalogue, including to customers in markets where we do not produce
content. We also intend to increase the size of our program portfolio to reach new customers in
emerging markets, such as India, where we believe there is great potential for growth in terms of
viewers and where a program based on the same format can be produced for different territories in
different languages, which we have capacity to produce thanks to our local production labels. For the
year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 12% of our total revenues from our distribution
business. Formats that have already been developed and produced, together with existing programs,
can be distributed with comparatively high margins.

We intend to apply our strategy of incentivizing local managing directors to develop adaptable
formats in-house with an international appeal that can generate distribution and other secondary
revenues, together with our proven format-sharing practices. Some of our most anticipated upcoming
releases include _Totally Spies! and_ _Nevsu. In addition, we plan to further develop our relationships_
with third-party producers to secure productions outside our footprint and distribution rights of
premium content through Banijay Rights Limited. We focus on sourcing partnerships and deals that
generate positive returns and making selective investments to secure intellectual property rights from
producers that we believe can deliver new long-running formats. We target premium scripted content
in the English language, which can be easily distributed internationally and is well-suited to the
catalogue of many OTT platforms, as well as formatted non-scripted content which can often be
adapted by our companies worldwide.

We believe that this strategy will allow us to capitalize on current market trends, with SVOD
platforms increasing their demand for non-scripted content, in addition to their traditional focus on
scripted content. We also plan to continue focusing on developing know-how in our different markets
in order to create traction for upcoming formats developed in another country.

**_Optimize Content and Catalogue Monetization on All Platforms Globally_**

In the United States, SVOD services have increased the value of our catalogue series and movies due
to increased viewership by consumers and the correlating demand and spending by digital platforms.
Although these investments are primarily made in the United States and in English-language content,
the European market is gaining an increasing amount of traction with U.S.-based streaming platforms,


-----

which are expanding globally. We also benefit from a supportive regulatory environment in Europe
which helps balancing bargaining powers when negotiating with SVOD platforms, hence allowing for
multiple monetization channels.

As a global independent producer with a proven track record of producing and distributing longlasting and travelling content (through local versions of some of the world’s biggest titles, as well as
original territorial content in local languages), we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these
trends and to efficiently monetize our content across all platforms through our “360-degree” strategy.
We intend to continue developing best-in-class internal format-sharing practices and, due to our size
and decentralized organizational structure, we believe we can tailor our formats and programs to our
target customers more easily than other large production groups, thereby efficiently monetizing our
content and catalogue. In addition, our distribution business enables us to license our portfolio
globally, including in markets in which we do not currently maintain production operations, and
generate revenues with high margins due to the relatively limited costs incurred in managing our
existing formats and programs.

We intend to increase our secondary revenues by better monetizing our large catalogue of over
172,000 hours of content. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 5% of our revenues
from our commercial activity, including secondary revenues. We aim to increase secondary revenues
by taking advantage of in-program digital technologies and other features, and also developing
sponsorships with on-air partners to integrate product placement in our programs and to supplement
broadcasters’ production budgets. The rapidly growing AVOD market represents new secondary
window exploitation opportunities for our content, and we believe we have already positioned
ourselves as a leader in the FAST space to seize such opportunities, thanks to the operation of our
own FAST channels (including Horizons: Powered By Banijay) syndicated on platforms such as Pluto
or Freevee. We are also increasing our presence on social media platforms such as Meta and TikTok
in order to reach online audiences and further monetize our catalogue through digitalization.

In addition, we focus on developing branded content and partnerships with brands to establish content
supplier agreements with key global broadcasters. We try to retain ancillary rights when negotiating
with broadcasters to be able to develop merchandizing, branded events and experiences and off-air
licenses, and exploit the full value chain of our intellectual property rights. For example, we have
entered into a brand licensing arrangement for Peaky Blinders in connection with the development of
a freemium mobile strategy game. We are also able to monetize content with low development costs
through digital platforms with live-streaming capabilities, and through the development of games
based on intellectual property rights which we retain in connection with our formats.

We have leveraged our know-how with in-house talents by creating talent agencies which generate
secondary revenues, having followed the model of the talent management agency managed by
Brainpool. Notably, Banijay Talent operates as a French “influencer” marketing company that helps
brands grow with bespoke influencing strategies, and has generated significant follower growth for
its customer brands and developed key relationships with a large number of influencers from the
television, fashion, beauty, luxury, entertainment and sport sectors. We intend to further emulate the
commercial success of Banijay Talent across other countries where we operate to increase our
secondary revenues.

**_Continue to Attract and Retain the Best Talents_**

We rely on our management team to implement our growth strategies and our creative talents to
produce formats that address our customers’ needs. Attracting, cultivating and retaining talents has
been, and will remain, critical to our success. We plan to continue to attract and retain highly skilled
personnel, particularly for their creative talent. We intend to further strengthen our collaborative and
entrepreneurial culture by continuing to incentivize our local managers to foster the high flexibility,
independence and autonomy of each of our production companies. We also intend to continue to run
our long-term incentive plan to ensure the commitment of local management teams and focus on
further aligning our key personnel’s interests with the Group’s through a focus on value creation.


-----

Similarly, we plan to maintain our Group-wide bonus scheme to incentivize creative talents
responsible for the creation and development of successful formats that are adapted in our key
markets and have generated a certain production value for the Group. Talent attraction and retention is
also bolstered by our talent management systems, which allow us to anticipate departures and plan for
successions in the event of any departures.

Our proven track record of establishing successful joint ventures is also a key part of our talent
acquisition and retention strategy, as joint ventures appeal to talents who would like to maintain their
independence but are interested in a strong partnership with us. Talents of our joint venture partners
benefit from our broad creative network, access to financing, information, contacts and, most
importantly, our catalogue of formats, major brands and distribution capacity. In addition, they may
be able to sell us their remaining shareholding once the business has developed successfully because,
if a joint venture is successful, we may acquire the remaining share capital in the production company
on pre-agreed financial terms while retaining the talents who partnered with us.

**_Consolidate our Leadership Through Selective M&A to Further Strengthen our Position as an_**
**_Integrated Global Entertainment Leader Underpinned by our Content Catalogue and Deep_**
**_Portfolio of Intellectual Property Rights_**

We intend to continue pursuing various selective and value-enhancing strategic acquisitions, business
combinations and joint ventures intended to complement and/or expand our business, in line with our
overall growth plan. We expect such acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures to allow
us to expand our geographic footprint and diversify into new genres and markets, while gaining
access to top local talent. Our platform is scalable and has a demonstrated ability to integrate large
groups and implement synergies within a short period of time following transformative operations,
such as the Banijay Zodiak Merger and the Endemol Shine Acquisition. We also intend to continue
leveraging our distribution subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited, to expand and optimize our content
catalogue through our business combinations. We regularly evaluate M&A opportunities and apply a
disciplined approach, pursuing transactions that comply with our cost-payback and other strategic
selection criteria, seeking targets that are cash generative, additive to the platform and synergistic.
Furthermore, following the Balich Acquisition, we intend to leverage our history of successful
strategic acquisitions to seamlessly integrate Balich into the Group and implement synergies resulting
from the transaction. Moving forward, we plan to fully leverage our management team’s proven track
record of delivering on their budget and use our strong M&A capabilities to sustainably consolidate
our leadership as the world’s leading independent producer and distributor of content.

We plan to capitalize on our know-how as the world’s leading independent producer and distributor of
content to develop a dedicated entertainment business. We believe that our ambition to become an
integrated global leader in the production of live events will be supported by the Balich Acquisition,
pursuant to which we will gain access to Balich’s international network and existing expertise in
creating, producing and delivering live shows. Our German production company, Brainpool, will also
undergo a restructuring of its live events, agency and tour division under a new label focused on
comedy event and stand-up artists. We plan on leveraging our production and distribution network to
unlock synergy value in the entertainment space, which we believe remains largely unconsolidated
and has a business model similar to that upon which the Group was built. Moving forward, we will
apply the same strategies in our entertainment business as we have in the past in our production and
distribution business to build our offering, relying on a mix of organic growth, synergies with the
other divisions of the Group and various selective, value-enhancing acquisitions, business
combinations and joint ventures.

**_Act as a Sustainable and Responsible Player at the Corporate and Production Levels_**

We aim to create an environment where employees can perform to the best of their abilities in an
inclusive work culture. We will continue to build diverse, supportive and collaborative teams, while
ensuring equal opportunities for our workforce, including through the development of our global


-----

diversity and inclusion board and employee resource groups. We foster inclusion and promote
diversity both on- and off-screen through specialized partnerships to drive best practice and ensure
that we attract and retain talents who share our values and support our local communities. In addition
to our ongoing focus on diversity and inclusion, we plan to continue promoting and emphasizing
professional and ethical behavior in the workplace, while at the same time fostering a positive
physical and mental health environment through new initiatives guaranteeing the health and wellbeing of our employees, such as the training of mental health first-aiders and the inclusion of care
guidelines in all format bibles across all production companies. As part of our long-term growth plan,
we also intend to continue advocating a sustainability-led mindset to reduce our carbon footprint and
overall impact on the environment. We believe that our efforts towards becoming a carbon-neutral
producer are bolstered by our continued collaboration with specialist consultancy firms and local
industry-led initiatives such as 3Degrees and Ecoprod, as well as our active membership of the Albert
Consortium, which we use as a platform to incentivize the television and film production industry to
reduce its waste and carbon footprint.

subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to the
limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_


-----

_Interests.”_

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the
Guarantors accounted for 72% of our total assets, 50% of
our consolidated revenues and 84% of our EBITDA. As
of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions,
subsidiaries of the Issuer not guaranteeing the Notes had
€72.1 million of indebtedness outstanding (excluding
intercompany loans and lease liabilities).

Each Guarantee will be subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and certain contractual and legal
limitations. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and
_Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement,”_
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
_on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests.” By virtue of these limitations, a_
Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Notes, or a Guarantor may effectively have no
obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws_
_and other limitations on the Guarantees may adversely_
_affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of_
_the Notes and of the Collateral.” In addition, the_
Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances.
See “Description of the Notes—Brief Description of the
_Notes—Guarantees Release” and “Certain Insolvency_
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

                       - be general senior secured obligations of the
Guarantors;

                       - rank pari passu in right of payment with all
such Guarantors’ existing and future senior
indebtedness that is not expressly

subordinated in right of payment to the Notes
and any guarantees thereof, including
indebtedness outstanding under the Senior
Facilities and any guarantees thereof;

                       - rank senior in right of payment to all of such
Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness
that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes and any guarantees
thereof; and

                       - be effectively subordinated to all of such

the liabilities under the Senior Facilities. A portion of the
Collateral also secures the Existing Senior Notes on a
second-priority basis.

**Use of Proceeds .......................................** The gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be
approximately €910.0 million (equivalent). On the Issue
Date, we intend to use the proceeds of the Offering to (i)

Senior Secured Notes and (ii) pay fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

**Optional Redemption .............................** Prior to   , 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or part of
the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, plus a “make-whole” premium as
described under “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption.”_

Prior to   , 2025, the Issuer may, on one or more


-----

**Additional Amounts; Tax**

**Redemption ......................................**


occasions, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal
amount of each of the Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes
with the proceeds from specified equity offerings at the
redemption prices as described under “Description of the
_Notes—Optional Redemption,” in each case plus accrued_
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the
date of redemption, provided that at least 50% of the
original principal amount of the Dollar Notes or the Euro
Notes, as applicable (including any additional Dollar
Notes or Euro Notes, as the case may be) issued under
the Indenture remain outstanding (unless all Euro Notes
or Dollar Notes, as the case may be, are redeemed
substantially concurrently).

Prior to   , 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of
the aggregate principal amount of each series of the
Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal
amount of any additional Dollar Notes or Euro Notes, as
the case may be, issued) in each calendar year at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount
thereof.

At any time on or after   , 2025, the Issuer may redeem
all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices described
under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

Any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer, any
future guarantor or relevant Paying Agent with respect to
the Notes will be made without withholding or deduction
for taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction unless
required by law. Subject to certain exceptions and
limitations, if the Issuer, any future guarantor or relevant
Paying Agent is required by law to withhold or deduct
such taxes with respect to a payment on any Note, the
Issuer or such future guarantor, as applicable, will pay
the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount
received after such withholding is not less than the
amount that would have been received in the absence of
the withholding. See “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes.”_

Subject to and as set forth in “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer and any future guarantor_
will not be liable to pay any additional amounts to
holders of the Notes in certain circumstances.

If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing
jurisdiction become effective after the issuance of such
Notes which would impose withholding taxes or other
deductions on the payments on the Notes, and would
require the Issuer to pay additional amounts (as defined
in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”), the
Issuer may redeem such Notes in whole, but not in part,
at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if


-----

any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control ..................................** Upon the occurrence of certain events defined as
constituting a change of control or upon certain asset
sales, the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all
outstanding Notes of such series at a purchase price equal
to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts to, but
excluding, the date of the purchase. See “Description of
_the Notes—Change of Control.”_

**Tender Offers .........................................** In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if
holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the Issuer or any third party making such
a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the
Notes of such series validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party
will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such
purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each
other holder of such series of Notes. See “Description of
_the Notes—Optional Redemption—General.”_

**Certain Covenants .................................** The Indenture will limit, among others, the ability of the
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                       - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness
and issue certain preference stock;

                       - pay dividends, redeem share capital and
make certain investments;

                       - make certain other restricted payments;

                       - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                       - impose restrictions on the ability of the
restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends;

                       - transfer or sell certain assets;

                       - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                       - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;
and

                       - impair the security interests for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as
long as the Notes achieve investment-grade ratings. See
“Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Certain_ _Covenants—_


-----

_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment_
_Grade Status.”_

Each of the covenants will be subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.”_

not be, registered under U.S. federal or state or any

currently no market. Although the Initial Purchasers have

(a) Represents our estimate of the revenue contribution (i) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, in connection with the Balich
Acquisition (€315 million) and the acquisitions of A Fábrica and Twenty Two Productions, as if such acquisitions had occurred on
July 1, 2022, (ii) for the year ended December 31, 2022, in connection with the acquisitions of Beyond, Znak TV, Grøenlandia,

(4) We define EBITDA as operating profit (loss) for the relevant period before depreciation and amortization expenses. We define
Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA for the relevant period adjusted for certain exceptional, non-recurring items, including other noncurrent operating expenses, share-based payment expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses included in Adjusted EBITDA,
management fees and parent expenses and impairment losses and provisions, net of reversals. We define Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period further adjusted for the estimated annualized effect of acquisitions and
synergies.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and
should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flow or any other measure of
performance derived in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this
offering memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and differ
from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in “Description of the Notes” and in the Indenture. We present EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA for informational purposes only. There can be no assurance that items we have identified
for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations
for Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions and management estimates. These
amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This
information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition
or results of operations of the acquired businesses or other transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our
consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied
upon when making an investment decision. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA because we
believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt. EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” The

EBITDA for the periods indicated:

(b) Unless otherwise indicated, and other than for percentages and ratios, the financial information of Banijay for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2023, represents the mathematical calculation of subtracting the applicable financial information for
the six months ended June 30, 2022 from the applicable financial information for the year ended December 31, 2022, and
adding the applicable financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The financial information of Banijay for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or presented in
accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes
only. This information is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for such a period or any future period or
any financial position at any past or future date.

(c) Represents operating expenses out of the ordinary course of business. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, exceptional
operating expenses primarily related to acquisition costs (€4 million) and restructuring costs (€3 million), partially offset by
the positive impact of changes in our consolidation scope (€1 million). For the year ended December 31, 2022, exceptional
operating expenses primarily related to restructuring costs (€11 million), acquisition costs (€3 million), changes in our
consolidation scope (€8 million) and litigation costs incurred during the period (€4 million). For the year ended December
31, 2021, exceptional operating expenses primarily related to restructuring costs, acquisition costs and litigation costs
incurred during the period (€34 million), partially offset by a capital gain on investment in associates (€8 million). For the
year ended December 31, 2020, exceptional operating expenses primarily related to restructuring costs and acquisition costs.

(d) Represents share-based payment expenses in connection with long-term incentive plans entered into with certain key
managers. Our incentive plans are multi-year schemes separate from remuneration contracts that are either cash-settled, with
phantom shares exercisable after four to eight years, or equity-settled, with free shares currently expected to be granted until
the year ended December 31, 2029. These share-based payment expenses are not cashed out in the year.

(e) Represents the portion included in our Adjusted EBITDA of the depreciation and amortization of production costs in
connection with the production of scripted content, including amortization of fiction productions, provisions for debt
(excluding debt allocated to production) and provisions for other liabilities and charges.

(f) Represents management fees and expenses paid to our indirect parent company for the period.

(g) Represents impairment losses and provisions, net of reversals, primarily incurred in connection with the depreciation of our
intellectual property rights.

(h) Represents our estimate of the EBITDA contribution (i) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, mainly in connection
with the Balich Acquisition as if the Balich Acquisition had occurred on July 1, 2022, (ii) for the year ended December 31,
2022, in connection with the acquisitions of Beyond, Znak TV, Grøenlandia, Movimenti, Tooco, MoviePlus, Pokeepsie
Films, Puzzle Media, Noisy Pictures and Posh as if such acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2022, (iii) for the years
ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, in connection with the Endemol Shine Acquisition as if the Endemol Shine Acquisition
had occurred on January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2020, respectively.

(i) Represents our estimated annualized run-rate synergies in connection with (i) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023
and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the acquisition of Beyond, realized through production and corporate cost
savings, and (ii) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Endemol Shine Acquisition, realized through
headcount reductions, IT integration and rationalization and rent footprint optimization.

(5) We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA for the relevant period divided by our revenues for the relevant period.

(6) We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period divided by our revenues for the relevant period.

(7) Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are performance measures we use and which we believe are used by investors because
they provide a useful measure of our results of operations. Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not defined measures
under IFRS. Therefore, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not a measure of our results of operations or liquidity and
should be viewed as supplemental to, but not as a substitute for, measures presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows,
which are determined in accordance with IFRS. As not all companies define Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the
same way, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures used by other companies. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non IFRS Financial
_Measures.” The following table shows a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities to our Free Cash Flow and_

###### RISK FACTORS 

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to considering carefully, in light_
_of the circumstances and your individual investment objectives, the information contained elsewhere_
_in this offering memorandum, you should carefully consider the risks described below before_
_investing in the Notes. If any of the events described below actually occurs, our business, results of_
_operations, financial condition or prospects could be materially adversely affected and, accordingly,_
_the value and the trading price of the Notes may decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of any_
_investment in the Notes. The order in which the risk factors are presented does not necessarily reflect_
_the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude or significance of the individual risk factors._
_Furthermore, the risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones that we face._
_Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be_
_immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial_
_condition or prospects._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We may not be able to retain key personnel or creative talents or to attract new creative talents._**

Our business and our success have depended and will continue to depend on our creative talents, our
management team and other key employees or partners, such as hosts, producers and local managers
in our production companies. These individuals possess unique skills that are critical to the creation
and production of new formats and programs as well as the operation of our business. The loss or an
extended interruption in the services of one or more of our hosts, producers, senior management or
other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition. Additionally, a limited number of our contracts (including contracts relating to
certain of our most important programs or formats, including, for example, Don’t Forget the Lyrics!
and It’s Only TV) with broadcasters contain “key man” provisions that would allow the counterparties
to terminate agreements early or to take over the production of the programs in case of the departure
of a specific host or talent or key people, and any such departure may depend on factors beyond our
control.

Considerable expertise could be lost or access thereto gained by competitors in the event of the
departure of our creative talents. We aim to retain our key managers, hosts, producers and creative
talents through various incentive agreements, such as earn-outs or put option agreements, when we
have acquired a company from them, incentive plans based on their contribution to the success of the
production company, non-compete clauses and exclusivity clauses. However, due to intense
competition within the industry, there is a risk of losing creative talents or qualified employees to
competitors or being unable to find a sufficient number of appropriate new talents or employees. For
example, it may be difficult to replace programs with or produced by Cyril Hanouna or Nagui, two
popular television hosts in France, or Bear Grylls. If any famous host were to leave our production
companies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition. In addition, certain of our scripted programs may be dependent on the availability and
performances of certain actors, actresses, directors and other creative talents. If we cannot retain these
talents or if they cannot continue to work on our programs for any reason, it could have a material
adverse effect on the production and distribution revenues from such scripted programs.

In addition to retaining talents, our future success depends in significant part on our ability to attract
new managers and creative talents as well as contractors and skilled and distinguished freelancers.
Competition for highly qualified management executives and creative talents is fierce. We may
experience difficulties in attracting new personnel, we may not be able to hire the necessary personnel
to implement our business strategy or we may need to pay higher compensation for employees than
we currently expect. A shortage in the availability of qualified personnel and creative talents could
limit our ability to grow. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in attracting and retaining the
personnel we need to develop our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.


-----

We also benefit from the investments and the expertise of Stéphane Courbit, our Chairman, since he
founded the Group in 2007. Mr. Courbit, who is involved in our development and business strategy, is
the founder and chairman of LOV Group. LOV Group controls FLE, which directly holds 100% of
the share capital of Banijay Group Holding, the parent company of Banijay. Additionally, a limited
number of Banijay’s key managers and creative talents have a right to terminate their agreements with
us in the event Mr. Courbit leaves Banijay. Therefore, the departure of Mr. Courbit or any of these
key managers and creative talents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_Customers may request to obtain intellectual property rights to the formats we create and programs_**
**_we produce, which may have a negative impact on our revenues._**

Broadcasters have increasingly requested intellectual property rights to the formats and programs for
which they fully fund the production. This trend is particularly strong in the United States and, to a
lesser extent, in other markets, where broadcasters tend to impose a “producer for hire” approach (i.e.,
the producer is an independent contractor managing the production process, without any intellectual
property rights to the program) and where it has become increasingly difficult for producers to retain
any intellectual property rights or a share of revenues from future licensing or sale, even when the
producer has originally developed the format or the program. In the United States, producers may be
required to finance at least part of the program to ensure that they are able to retain intellectual
property rights to the format, which is contrary to the market standard of fully funded non-scripted
business. In Europe, broadcasters have also started to ask for a share of ownership of the formats or
programs when they fully fund the production, whereas in certain countries, such as the Nordic
Countries and Italy, according to market practice, broadcasters generally co-own the content. For
example, in markets such as Germany, where broadcasters traditionally fully fund the production of
programs, we may not be able to retain intellectual property rights over the formats such broadcasters
have ordered, as such rights would be required by the broadcasters as a condition to funding.

The trend towards a “producer for hire” approach is also the general approach of digital platforms
such as Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and Google (which operates Android TV), in the
United States, Europe and other markets such as India and Latin America, which generally require the
transfer of ownership over all rights to the formats and programs that they finance. Digital platforms
usually require exploitation rights worldwide and in perpetuity for the programs they own, and may
ask for very long license periods in many territories or may require unlimited runs to air programs
based on preexisting formats they do not own or control and which rights are retained by us. The
increased viewership by consumers and the correlating demand and spending by digital platforms may
lead the “producer for hire” approach to become more prominent with traditional broadcasters outside
of the United States, as digital platforms exercise a growing influence over our market practices.
Notably, broadcasters have become reluctant to share revenues generated by intellectual property
rights that they used to share in the past. For example, unlimited VOD rights are now considered to be
“primary rights” in many markets and are granted to broadcasters for the entire license period without
sharing any additional revenues with the producer. Broadcasters may also require extensive holdbacks
to ensure that certain formats will not be used in the market in which they operate for a certain period
of time, even after they stop to commission new programs, and may require that none of their local
competitors be allowed to capitalize on these formats. When we are not able to retain sufficient
ownership of the intellectual property rights of the formats we create and programs we produce, we
may lose control over our formats and programs and a portion of the distribution and secondary
revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our distribution and secondary business represented
17% of our total revenues. Insofar as new production does not produce additional retained intellectual
rights that can be sold or licensed, there is a risk that this revenue stream may decrease, or
alternatively, if we are unable to produce localized versions of our formats because we do not control
of the underlying intellectual property rights, that we may need to purchase intellectual property
developed by third parties in order to maintain this revenue stream.


-----

While we strive to retain maximum intellectual property rights when negotiating with broadcasters,
we may not be able to do so and, if this trend further develops, it could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Intellectual property infringements may have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Our ability to compete in our industry depends, in part, upon successfully protecting and retaining our
proprietary and intellectual property, especially with respect to formats, which are more difficult to
protect than rights to a program, because a program is a finished product that has already aired rather
than a formalized concept. We protect our intellectual property rights to our formats and programs
through available copyright and trademark laws. We then license and distribute these rights to
reputable companies in specific territories for limited durations. Despite these precautions, existing
copyright and trademark laws offer only limited practical protection for formats in certain
jurisdictions. Unlike patents or trademarks for which registration is required, copyright does not
require any registration and provides limited protection as it is more difficult to prove and protect,
especially for formats. Copyright infringement is particularly difficult to defend in many parts of the
world that lack effective copyright and technical protective measures to prove copyright, or that lack
effective means for enforcing such measures, including certain jurisdictions in which we operate in
Asia. In addition, intellectual property rights may not effectively protect the content we distribute
around the world through our distribution business. The interpretation of copyright, privacy and other
laws as applied to our content, and piracy detection and enforcement efforts, remain in flux.
Specifically, uncertainty regarding the legal treatment of intellectual property rights created through
or with the assistance of artificial intelligence may make it harder to protect any such intellectual
property rights, or may otherwise significantly reduce the value of any such intellectual property
rights. The failure to strengthen or the weakening of existing intellectual property laws could also
make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property and negatively affect its
value.

It may also be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our formats or portions of our formats
without entering into a format license agreement with us or to exploit our programs, or part of our
programs, without entering into a license agreement for one of our programs. Unauthorized
distribution of our formats or programs has an adverse effect on our business because it reduces the
revenues that we are able to receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our formats or
programs. It undermines lawful distribution channels and inhibits our ability to recoup or profit from
the costs incurred in creating such works. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a
meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could also result in erosion of our local
brands. We incur significant costs in order to protect intellectual property rights to our formats, to
monitor copyright infringement and to engage legal proceedings when necessary, which may affect
our profitability, and we may not be successful in preventing harm to our business.

In addition, it is an inherent risk in our industry that people may claim to have developed a format
similar to, and/or own intellectual property rights with respect to our formats and programs, whether
or not such claims are frivolous. We may have to resort to litigation, arbitration or other legal
proceedings in order to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the
validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or
invalidity. Any such litigation or arbitration proceedings could result in substantial costs, including
costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenues from the intellectual property
that is the subject of such proceeding, and the resulting diversion of resources and management’s
attention could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_The revenues generated by our programs depend on positive reception by audiences, which is_**
**_difficult to predict and impacted by various factors that we do not control._**

Our core business is the development and production of programs that we license to broadcasters and
to digital platforms. We generate revenues not only from producing and licensing these programs, but
also from further development of the program (such as producing future seasons) and from secondary


-----

revenues such as the distribution in other countries or the licensing of related intellectual property
rights. Therefore, revenues from a program, other than the initial license to a broadcaster or digital
platform, depend on a program’s audience and its good ratings, which are synonymous with the
success of a program. A significant portion of our revenue, for example, is dependent on the
continued success and relevance of MasterChef (which represented 6% of our total revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2022) and Big Brother (which represented 8% of our total revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2022). Any change in viewer behavior impacting the continued viability of
these formats globally may materially impact our revenue and profitability. Furthermore, once we
have produced a program for a broadcaster, its success can be impacted by certain factors that we do
not control. For example, broadcasters choose the time slot for the program, and digital platforms
decide on the visibility of a given program within the services they offer without reference to ratings.
If a program is scheduled at a time that cannot adequately reach its targeted audience, the program
may not be successful despite its potential. Our customers can also control the promotion and
marketing around the program, if any. If a program does not reach a sufficient audience or does not
receive satisfactory ratings, we may lose opportunities to generate secondary revenues and, for
scripted programs that we have partially financed, we may also be unable to recover distribution
advances made by our distribution subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited. While we try to reduce our
exposure to any particular program’s success, our business may be negatively impacted if any of our
key programs are no longer successful.

In addition, we have no control over whether broadcasters or digital platforms decide to renew our
programs for additional seasons. When we produce daily or weekly programs, our agreements with
broadcasters usually run for the whole television season, typically from September to June, and are
generally renewed on that basis. If one of our customers were to decide to stop broadcasting a
program that generates significant revenues for us, this may have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, certain scripted programs require
high production costs and upfront investments. Our distribution subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited,
will sometimes participate in these upfront investments, anticipating revenues from the distribution of
the scripted program in various countries. If broadcasters or digital platforms decide not to renew the
program after the first or second season, we may incur losses with respect to our upfront investments.
Broadcasters and digital platforms may also decide to modify their offering to target a different
audience and therefore cancel certain existing programs in favor of fresh programs. Decisions from
broadcasters to terminate or not to renew some of our programs are discretionary and may have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period, including due to_**
**_seasonality._**

Revenues and projections for any independent production company that produces original television
and digital content can be expected to fluctuate until the content is delivered and could fluctuate even
after the content has aired. As a result of the broadcasting schedules of television networks and the
fact that broadcasters typically premiere shows in the second half of the calendar year, we generally
report higher revenues in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. In addition, we typically recognize
revenues from the sale of a program to a broadcaster at the time of the program’s delivery, which
creates a mismatch between the revenues we actually receive in connection with such sale and the
revenues recognized in our financial statements. The following factors could impact our generation of
revenues from time to time:

- Broadcasters may decide to make changes to a program during the production process, which
may increase our production costs and cause delays in delivery or even postpone delivery to the
next calendar year. Such delays may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

- All broadcasters have a period of time during which they may reject or return our programs for
modifications (both for editorial and technical reasons), and until the expiration of such period
and the final approval of our content, we may not be able to recognize the expected revenues.


-----

- Our revenues depend significantly upon the appeal of our content to our customers, the timing
of the release of our programs and the commercial success of these programs, none of which can
be predicted with certainty. For example, if a broadcaster decides not to renew one of our
programs, it could materially impact our revenues compared to the previous period.

- Unanticipated delays in a program’s production can delay our distribution revenues since we are
unable to distribute a program until it has been finalized.

Accordingly, our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period. The results
of one period may not be representative of the results of any future period. Any quarterly fluctuations
that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. This
could cause the value of our local brands to fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Inaccurately anticipating changes and trends in popular culture, media or technology, which_**
**_impact viewing habits, can negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial_**
**_condition._**

Trends in the television and digital content sector change quickly. We have responded and continue to
respond to such trends and developments by modifying, refreshing, extending and expanding our
programming and product offerings on an ongoing basis. However, the ultimate appeal and popularity
of content and products targeted to viewers can be volatile and we may not be able to anticipate and
react quickly enough to shifts in tastes and interests within our local markets. If we inaccurately
anticipate trends in popular culture and media, our current content may become less attractive to
audiences and the ratings of our current programs may decrease, which could lead to reduced demand
for our programs and formats from our customers. We may also lose existing broadcasting slots and
new opportunities. Even if we accurately anticipate new trends in the television and digital content
sector, we may incur significant costs in adjusting to these new trends. For example, scripted
programs are increasingly popular, especially with the development of digital platforms, but are also
significantly more expensive to produce than non-scripted programs, which have historically
represented the core of our business. Adapting our business model to such new expensive trends may
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

A change in viewer and consumer preferences could cause our programming and our local brands to
decline in popularity, particularly if our targeted audience loses interest in our highest rated or viewed
programs or our daily programs, and thus, on the most profitable content in our portfolio. For the year
ended December 31, 2022, our top 15 shows collectively contributed to 17% of our production
revenues, with none of our formats and programs individually contributing to more than 2% of our
production revenues during the same period. Changes in viewer preferences and habits could decrease
our revenues and jeopardize the renewal of our contracts with broadcasters, distributors and other
customers. Moreover, we may invest substantial amounts of resources in a program that is not
renewed after the first season and as a result, we will not be able to reach the level of revenues and/or
margins budgeted and benefit from our production expertise to increase margins for the following
seasons, such as Fear Factor in Belgium in 2022. If our programs do not achieve sufficient consumer
and audience acceptance or satisfactory ratings, they are not likely to be renewed, which could lead to
a decline in our revenues from television and digital content production, distribution and ancillary
rights or these revenues may fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment
decisions and thereby could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

Viewers may also object to the content we produce or distribute based on their religious, political or
ideological positions. This may apply, in particular, to live broadcasts and content that is graphic in
nature, politically oriented or targeted at a specific segment of the audience, including, for example,
those who speak a certain language. This may also be the case with respect to regional reproductions
of successful formats. While we try to cater to social, cultural, religious and political positions while
making adaptions, we may not always be successful in doing so. Viewers, interest groups, political
and religious parties or other organizations may assert legal claims against us, seek to ban the


-----

exhibition of our media content, protest against our programs and products or object in a variety of
other ways.

**_We are subject to reputational risks as a result of our production companies’ activities_**

In recent years, our production companies have been subject to scrutiny as to the well-being of the
participants in our non-scripted programs and our reality programs in particular, and the effect of such
programs on the wider public. Any of the foregoing may require us to expend substantial resources
and/or to discontinue certain offerings, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, Cyril Hanouna, one
of Banijay’s key managers and a very popular television host in France, was accused of inappropriate
behavior on television in Banijay’s program _Touche pas à mon poste!_ and, on June 7, 2017, the
French content regulator (Conseil supérieur de l’audiovisuel or the “CSA”) banned C8, the
broadcaster of Touche pas à mon poste!, from airing any advertisements during the program as well as
15 minutes before and after each broadcast for a period of three weeks. In addition, in April 2019, the
CSA issued a warning to C8 pursuant to which Touche pas à mon poste! could be prohibited to air in
prime time or access prime time, which may negatively impact our revenues as it might become
difficult to negotiate with this broadcaster in the future. Similar decisions could have a negative
impact on our local brand image and on our revenues. In addition, during the shooting of Koh Lanta
(the French adaptation of Survivor) in May 2018, an incident between two participants led to the
cancellation of the show. In the entertainment industry, instances of sexual harassment, other forms of
harassment and bullying and inappropriate behavior are increasingly brought to light. Any actual or
perceived inappropriate behavior from our employees or cast members, whether or not in the course
of a production, could have a significant negative impact on our reputation and on the popularity of
our content or result in legal action against us, the cancellation of our production rights, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Natural disasters, adverse weather conditions and other catastrophic natural or manmade_**
**_calamities, as well as epidemics or pandemics, could have a significant adverse impact on our_**
**_business._**

Our production business is vulnerable to damage or disruption from severe weather events, such as
rain, snow, wind, storms, hurricanes or other natural disasters, such as flooding, earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, nuclear disasters or a combination thereof, as well as other events, such as fire or war,
which may negatively impact our business. If any such events were to directly damage, destroy or
disrupt the operation of our production activities, it could delay our production, completion and
distribution of formats and programs in a timely fashion or at all, or result in significant remedial
costs, any of which could negatively impact our business. The impact of any of the foregoing could
have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain its spread and
address its impact have had significant direct and indirect effects on businesses and commerce
generally, including disruptions to supply chain, workforce, international travel, transactional activity,
facility operation and production. As a result of some of the measures taken by governments in the
early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate its spread, we were unable to film any of our
programs in a number of countries in which we operate from March 2020 to May 2020, which
resulted in a significant number of production delays. Additionally, filming of certain programs was
also postponed after May 2020 as a result of travel restrictions and constraints in the casting of actors,
candidates and hosts for our formats and programs. Once filming and production resumed, we also
incurred additional production costs in order to ensure compliance with governmental guidelines
regarding social distancing, on-site testing, sanitation and hygiene. Although some of these costs were
covered by our customers, they were not included in our production fee calculations and therefore
decreased our margins. The extent and scope of restrictions on the conduct of business that may be
put in place to combat any future resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain. Although
there was no meaningful impact on our business or financial condition from the COVID-19 pandemic


-----

in the six months ended June 30, 2023, we cannot predict the impact that any future developments
relating to it may have on our business.

A resurgence or prolonged continuance of a public health crisis could have a material adverse effect,
including materially increased volatility in financial markets and significant worsening of the global,
European or U.S. macroeconomic outlooks. There are no comparable recent events in scale and
duration that provide us with guidance, and so we cannot currently estimate with any certainty, nor
can we provide any assurance as to whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. For further
discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—_ _Factors Affecting Our Results of_
_Operations—General Economic Conditions in Our Markets.”_

**_We may need additional capital to fund our growing operations, especially for the production of_**
**_scripted programs. If we are not able to obtain sufficient capital, we may be forced to limit the_**
**_scope of our operations._**

The production, completion and distribution of television and digital programs, particularly scripted
programs, are subject to a number of uncertainties, including delays and increased expenditures due to
disruptions or events beyond our control. Risks such as the death or disability of star performers,
technical complications with special effects or other aspects of production, shortages of necessary
equipment, damage to film negatives, master tapes and recordings, misbehavior of performers
(including actors and/or actresses), employees, participants or other persons acting in connection with
our programs may cause cost overruns and delay or frustrate the completion or funding of a
production or our return on investments.

While we endeavor to respect our broadcaster customers’ budgets and have a strong reputation for
achieving this goal, if a television production incurs budget overruns, we may have to use our own
cash reserves or seek additional financing from outside sources to complete production. With respect
to distribution, if we are unable to accurately predict consumer preferences towards our programs, or
third-party programs for which we have the distribution rights, we may lose our investments,
especially for scripted programs for which we typically make upfront investments and rely on
distribution revenues to finance the production either partially or significantly.

While we believe that we will be able to fund our business through operating cash flow generated
though our business model, if the generation of our cash flow is lower than anticipated or the
productions do not come to fruition in the anticipated time frame, we could require additional debt
financing to sustain our operations. If we are unable to obtain adequate additional debt financing on
reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to continue to develop our business, especially the
production of scripted programs which requires larger investments (in particular at the development
phase), and we would have to modify our business plan and projections accordingly. If adequate
financing is not available, or unavailable on acceptable terms, we may find that we are unable to fund
expansion, continue to offer products and services, take advantage of acquisition opportunities,
develop or enhance our products or services, or respond to competitive pressures in the industry. Any
of the foregoing may jeopardize our ability to continue operations successfully and profitably and in
turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_A failure to honor our obligations under the terms of our agreements with broadcasters could have_**
**_a material adverse effect on our business._**

We rely on contracts with broadcasters to pay for our production costs, use our intellectual property
rights and ultimately to grow our business. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able
to meet broadcasters’ growing demands, reduced budgets and timelines, and this may increase our
programs’ production costs and future prospects with the same or new broadcasters. If we are not able
to honor our obligations with broadcasters, this may negatively impact our production companies’
reputations in their respective markets or affect our formats and programs. In addition, our
relationship with certain broadcasters may be jeopardized and lead to a reduction in, or termination of,


-----

our business with them if we are unable to honor our obligations in a timely manner or at all, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Changes in global or regional economic and political conditions could adversely affect our_**
**_business, results of operations or financial condition._**

While the television industry has historically demonstrated resilience and the ability to rebound from
challenging economic and political conditions, we are still sensitive to changes in the level of
economic activity and economic conditions in the geographies and sectors in which we operate.
Periods of economic weakness or recession, continuously rising interest rates, fiscal or political
uncertainty, market volatility, declining employment levels, disruption to the global markets,
curtailment of government or corporate spending or the public perception that any of these may occur,
may negatively affect the performance of our business. Uncertainty about global and regional
economic conditions or a downturn in the global television and digital content industry could
adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, recent global supply chain disruptions and other
geopolitical conflicts have impacted global economic conditions, thereby resulting in shortages in
materials and services and increased inflationary pressure. As of June 30, 2023, we had successfully
completed the sale of one of our two Russian affiliates, and were in the process of exiting the
remaining one, which is a dormant entity with no business activities. For the year ended December 31,
2022, less than 1% of our revenues and current operating profit were generated in Russia. As of the
date of this offering memorandum, our operations with our Russian subsidiaries have been ceased,
and we therefore no longer exercise control over such subsidiaries for the purposes of IFRS 10. It is
difficult to predict the scope and extent that any potential impact of the increasing tensions and other
geopolitical conflicts could have on our operations. Policy responses to inflation, such as increases to
central bank policy rates in respect of the currencies with which we conduct our operations or in
which our outstanding debt is denominated, may also impact our business, for example, by causing
credit conditions to tighten (and adversely affect our existing and prospective customers’ spending) or
by increasing the costs of our debt service obligations, to the extent we have outstanding debt with a
floating rate of interest.

The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on
European Union, which occurred on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”), has created lingering uncertainty
about the future relationship among the United Kingdom, one of our current preeminent markets, and
the EU member states and may constitute an additional risk for the financial markets and the
European economy. While the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed to a comprehensive,
zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement, which came into force provisionally on January 1, 2021,
Brexit has led to increased customs, health and safety checks at the borders of the United Kingdom
and the EU as well as a lack of haulage and other qualified supply chain and logistics workers, which
has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the United Kingdom.
Fluctuations in the exchange rates used to convert revenues denominated in GBP might also affect our
results of operations, net financial debt and consolidated net assets. Given the lack of comparable
precedent, it is unclear what long-term financial, trade and legal implications Brexit will have and
whether and how our UK business, including our several production companies located in the United
Kingdom and our distribution subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited, could be affected.

Additionally, an increase in price levels in television licenses or digital media subscription services
could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the television and digital content products we
offer. A decline in economic conditions could also reduce the amount consumers are willing to spend
on premium television show offerings and digital content. A decline in demand in any of our markets
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Depressed economic conditions or other political conditions may also have a negative impact on the
public financing of state-owned broadcasters, such as France Télévisions in France and the BBC in
the United Kingdom, and impair the ability of our business partners to satisfy their financial
obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be capable of executing or furthering our business


-----

plans during economic downturns and we may not be able to recoup investments we have made in
developing a program. In addition, the political environment in the countries in which we operate may
have an impact on the formats and programs we can produce and distribute in certain countries. For
example, in certain countries, some of the political talk shows we produce could be suspended or
cancelled if the hosts are too critical of the government, which could have an adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition in these countries.

**_We may not be able to adapt to new customers or to changes in viewer behavior resulting from the_**
**_development of new technologies._**

The television and multimedia industry continues to undergo significant changes, primarily due to
technological developments. We must successfully adapt to technological advances in our industry,
including the emergence of alternative distribution channels. In the United States and, to a lesser
extent, Europe, consumers, and in particular younger demographics, are viewing more content on
more devices and through SVOD or AVOD platforms, such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video
and Roku. Mobile devices such as tablets have accelerated the launch of digital platforms and the rise
of social media has increased audience engagement and contributed to new program development. We
have taken a number of initiatives in order to keep pace with these changes, including the operation of
our own FAST channels through Banijay Rights Limited, which are syndicated on several platforms
such as Pluto or Freevee, the monetization of our formats and programs on social media platforms
such as Meta and TikTok, and the overall digitalization of our business to accelerate content
production. However, these efforts may not be successful. Emerging forms of content distribution,
such as SVOD services, may provide different economic models and compete with our traditional
customers’ channels in ways that are not entirely predictable. Such changes may decrease viewership
of our traditional customers’ channels and impact the revenues we are able to generate from them.
These new content providers have lower budgets to invest in programs, which requires us to adapt our
production methods to these requirements in order to maintain our margins. For example, in the
United Kingdom, BBC and ITV have launched BritBox, a streaming platform focused on British TV
content, which has also struck a content partnership with Channel 4. BritBox was launched in the
United Kingdom in November 2019, after previous launches in the U.S. and Canada. The emergence
of BritBox in the United Kingdom commissioning market presents a potential risk to domestic content
producers. After the extension of the BBC iPlayer catch-up window (which refers to the amount of
time content is available on the BBC streaming service after the original broadcast date on the BBC)
from 30 days to twelve months, which is already restrictive for content producers, the BBC’s latest
policy is for BBC-commissioned shows to only move to a SVOD player that meets certain criteria in
the subsequent six-month window. There are four criteria, which include a requirement for the SVOD
player to provide the BBC with data-based insight into the performance of BBC content on its service.
Such criteria could result in content producers for BBC-commissioned shows being unable to
negotiate commercial terms with non-BritBox SVOD players and as such, SVOD players may not be
willing to meet these criteria. We must also adapt to changes in consumer behavior driven by
developments such as digital video recorders and mobile devices that are establishing themselves as
alternative providers of video and digital content services.

Developing new, innovative and improved formats and programs for evolving content providers is
costly and requires capital funding and significant creative resources. There can be no assurance that:
(i) the launch of any such new formats and programs would be successful; (ii) our market share for
such new formats and programs would continue to grow or remain as it is; (iii) we would be
successful in developing other new formats and programs systems or distribution channels or bring
them to market in a timely manner, or at all; (iv) our customers would not substitute our formats and
programs with competing ones; (v) our formats and programs will be able to address maturing
audience trends; or (vi) our competitors would not be able to produce formats and programs similar to
ours at a lower cost from other sources. A failure to adapt to these new distribution channels could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Increased employment costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations or financial condition._**


-----

Our labor costs, including salaries as well as payments to freelancers or writers, represent a significant
part of our expenses and may rise faster than expected in the future as a result of a larger workforce,
salary increases and headcount increases. Further, an increase in spending in the sector has resulted in
inflation of costs relating to talent acquisition and retention. The fierce competition for talent in the
global television and digital content industry, together with inflationary pressures, may lead to further
increases in our labor costs. We may be unable to offset the increase in labor costs through our
revenues. We incur costs for our creative talents, including format creators, hosts, writers, showrunners and producers, who create our original programming. Some of our original programming and
our creative talents have achieved significant popularity and critical acclaim, which has increased and
could continue to increase the costs of such programming in the future.

In addition, from time to time, we have disputes with writers, actors and other creative talents over the
amount of royalty and other payments to be made, primarily with respect to scripted programs. We
believe that disputes of this type are endemic to our business and similar disputes may arise from time
to time in the future. If labor costs increase further, our operating costs will also increase, which
could, if we are unable to recover these cost increases from our customers through increased selling
prices or offset such cost increases through labor productivity gains or other measures, have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In addition, in recent years, our production companies have been subject to scrutiny as to the wellbeing of the participants in our non-scripted programs and the effect of our programs on the public.
We offer training and aim to assist participants in our non-scripted programs through the production
process and after the production is complete, but if we are unable to address these issues
appropriately, this could result in litigation claims and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our market share and_**
**_revenues could decline or not grow as rapidly as expected._**

The global television and digital content industry is competitive and our results of operations are
sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, competitive pricing, promotional pressures, additional
competitor offerings and other factors such as flexibility in our production costs, many of which are
beyond our control. Our key markets are mature and competition is significant, resulting in continued
price pressure.

In the production business, ongoing market consolidation has led to the creation of a few large
international television groups, including our biggest competitors, such as Lionsgate, Fremantle, Red
Arrow Studios, All3Media, BBC Studios, ITV Studios and Mediawan, each of which provide their
local production companies with exclusive access to their catalogues. We also compete with the inhouse production units of large broadcasters, a large number of local production companies and a key
few independent production players. Broadcasters may choose to produce their own content in-house
rather than licensing our programs or commissioning a producer. For example, our competition in the
United Kingdom may increase significantly if Channel 4 becomes authorized to produce its content
in-house. Potential competitors may have developed innovative formats or blockbusters and have
greater name recognition, industry contacts and more extensive customer bases that could be
leveraged to accelerate their competitive activity. Moreover, potential competitors may establish
future cooperative relationships among themselves and with third parties, or merge into or acquire one
another, to enhance their programs in the television and digital marketspace, especially in light of the
ongoing market consolidation. In the distribution business, we face competition with other studios,
television production groups and independent producers for the licensing and distribution of our
formats and programs. Audience fragmentation has increased due the rise of digital platforms, both
global and regional.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively with any of our competitors for
market share or for acquisition opportunities or that the competitive pressures faced by us will not
adversely affect our business. Such intense competition could limit our opportunities to gain new


-----

customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Currency mismatches may have an adverse impact on our financial position._**

The euro is our functional currency. We use euros, U.S. dollars and GBP for the majority of our
transactions. However, we currently sell into a large number of countries worldwide with differing
and sometimes volatile currencies and each of our Group companies determines its own functional
currency. We believe sales or purchases among our Group companies are not significant and, as a
result, that cash flows are not sensitive to changes in currency because most of the expenses of our
production companies are in the currency of their income. Nevertheless, we inevitably face currency
risks, particularly with respect to U.S. dollar and GBP fluctuations. This could lead to an increase in
our leverage, despite our hedging strategies. For the year ended December 31, 2022, sales in the
Americas represented 23% of our revenues, and sales in the United Kingdom represented 19% of our
revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an adverse effect on our financial
position.

**_We are exposed to risks associated with content piracy, including digital and internet piracy, and_**
**_our information technology systems which may adversely affect our business, results of operations_**
**_or financial condition._**

The conversion of content into digital formats facilitates the creation, transmission and “sharing” of
high quality unauthorized copies of film, television programs and recorded music. As a result,
consumers may be able to download and distribute unauthorized or pirated copies of our television
programs over the internet. Some consumers may choose to stream, download or purchase physical
and digital pirated versions of content rather than watch our content via legitimate channels. Such
consumer practices directly affect broadcasters’ revenues and, as a result, affects the budgets that they
are able to allocate to acquiring our programs. Significant growth in these consumer practices in the
television industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_We are exposed to cyber security risks which may adversely affect our business, results of_**
**_operations or financial condition._**

Our operations also rely on the accuracy, availability and security of our information technology
systems. For example, we have been subject to phishing attacks and other forms of cyber security
risks. Cyberattacks and viruses pose growing threats to many companies, and any such threats could
cause material harm to our business, reputation and financial condition. Security incidents may be
perpetrated by internal bad actors, such as employees or contractors, or by third parties. Cyber
security threats can employ a wide variety of methods, may include the use of social engineering
techniques, are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, all of
which increase the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Furthermore,
because the techniques used by cyberattacks change frequently and generally are not identified until
after they are launched, we may not have the capacity to immediately detect, anticipate and
adequately prevent against them. Despite the measures that we have implemented, including those
related to cyber security such as conducting phishing tests, our systems could be breached or damaged
by computer viruses and systems attacks, natural or man-made incidents, disasters or unauthorized
physical or electronic access, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_Our success is dependent, in part, upon the integrity of our management and employees, and our_**
**_risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect violations of law._**

Our business operations involve risks associated with theft, fraud, bribery and corruption, or
allegations thereof, including with respect to our own employees as well as our customers. Our
existing compliance processes and controls may not be sufficient to prevent or detect inadequate
practices, theft, fraud and violations of law by our management, employees or agents, or our


-----

customers, as applicable. Compliance and controls systems in certain countries in which we operate
may be incomplete, unreliable, or inaccurately transmit data due either to technical shortcomings
which may or not be in our control, or malicious efforts of internal staff and third parties. Such
malicious efforts may include false invoices to shell entities that do not provide any services to the
Group, and may be exacerbated by poor or inconsistent control execution from branch to branch
within a country. Therefore, we may be unable to detect or prevent every instance of theft, fraud,
bribery and corruption involving our employees, management, directors, agents or other third parties
in the future. We are currently engaged in legal proceedings to recover and/or prosecute civilly and
assist in criminal proceedings related to incidents of malfeasance or alleged malfeasance by certain
former officers. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.”

To the extent we are not successful in protecting ourselves from such activities, we may be subject to
civil and criminal penalties and to reputational damage as a result of such occurrences. Allegations,
proceedings and convictions of certain crimes including, among others, theft, fraud, bribery and
corruption may make it more difficult for us to obtain or acquire new customers, to obtain necessary
approvals and licenses for the operation of our business or render us ineligible to participate in public
tenders. In addition, we may also be subject to reputational damage in connection with certain
activities, allegations and convictions related to FLE’s other businesses, to which we are associated in
publicly available information. The involvement or association of our employees, management,
directors or agents with theft, fraud, bribery or corruption and other crimes committed in relation to
our activities, or allegations or rumors relating thereto (including in relation to our indirect parent),
could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_Our business may be affected by the default of counterparties in respect of money owed to us._**

In the ordinary course of our business, we are often owed significant amounts of money by numerous
customers. If a customer undergoes financial difficulties, payments may be significantly delayed and,
ultimately, we may not be able to collect amounts payable to us under our agreements. This is
particularly true for our distribution business, whose customers are not necessarily large broadcasters
and come from all around the world. Any inability to collect amounts due could require us to write off
significant debts, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_We are subject to risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures._**

We have made or entered into, and as part of our business strategy will continue to pursue, various
acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures intended to complement or expand our
business, such as the Banijay Zodiak Merger, the Endemol Shine Acquisition and the Balich
Acquisition. Given that discussions or activities relating to potential acquisitions range from private
negotiations to participation in open bid processes, the timing of any such acquisition is uncertain.
Although we actively and regularly engage in discussions and activities with respect to possible
acquisitions and investments, we currently have no present agreements or understandings to enter into
any such material transaction. Any indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with an
acquisition may or may not increase our leverage relative to our EBITDA or to our equity
capitalization. In addition, we may encounter difficulties integrating acquired assets into our existing
operations.

In addition, we may not realize the expected benefits at the time we enter into agreements for this type
of transaction. We regularly acquire production companies to, among others, expand into new markets
or genres in a particular market, access talents and acquire intellectual property rights of formats and
programs developed by such companies and to benefit from the expertise of creative talents or
producers at such companies. If broadcasters are no longer interested in the programs or formats
resulting from these acquisitions, or if broadcasters are no longer interested in working with such
creative talents or producers, and decide not to renew them shortly after the relevant acquisition, we
may not be able to realize the expected revenues and we may fail to recoup our investments. Certain
talents may also be less in demand and decide to leave. For example, if the Mexican and U.S.


-----

Spanish-language entertainment markets do not grow in line with our projections, our joint venture
with Boomdog, a leading independent production company in Mexico, may not be as profitable as
expected.

Future acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures by us could also result in the following
consequences:

- we may fail to identify suitable acquisition or joint venture opportunities, which may restrict our
ability to grow our business;

- we may face competition from our direct competitors for certain acquisitions or joint venture
opportunities that we may consider beneficial, which could make it more difficult to organically
increase our business;

- we may fail to retain creative talents following an acquisition or business combination;

- we may not plan or manage a particular acquisition effectively;

- we may be unable to procure financing for an acquisition on satisfactory terms or at all;

- we may face increased competition for acquisitions as markets in which we operate undergo
continuing consolidation, particularly in the production business;

- we may not be able to retain key personnel or customer contracts of acquired businesses or joint
ventures (which, in the case of such contracts, can be due to change of control clauses in such
contracts);

- we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or legal liabilities related to the acquired
businesses for which we may be responsible as the successor owner, controlling entity or
operator in spite of any investigation we make prior to the acquisition and for which we have no
or insufficient protection;

- labor laws in certain countries may require us to retain more employees than would otherwise be
optimal from entities we acquire;

- future acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures could result in the incurrence of
additional debt and related interest expense or contingent liabilities and amortization expenses
related to intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, operating results and/or cash flow;

- future acquisitions may be subject to antitrust or competition approval of the transaction, which
may cause significant delays to the completion of any such acquisition or may prevent it from
being consummated at all;

- an acquisition may not achieve anticipated synergies or other expected benefits, or we may
underestimate the costs related to the implementation of such synergies or cost savings;

- we may incur substantial costs, face delays or experience other operational or financial problems
in integrating acquired businesses, such as costs and issues relating to monitoring, hiring and
training new personnel, the implementation of governance and compliance systems and
procedures, the integration of information technology and accounting and internal control
systems;

- we may incur costs associated with developing appropriate risk management and internal
control structures for acquisitions in a new market, or understanding and complying with a new
regulatory scheme;


-----

- increased investments may be needed in order to understand new markets and follow trends in
these markets in order to compete effectively;

- we may have a reduced ability to predict our performance or expenditures in the event we have
less experience in the market of the acquired business than in the markets in which we
previously operated;

- we may face potential economic or political instability depending on the countries in which we
acquire a business or a company;

- acquisitions in new or adjacent market segments, such as the production of live events, may not
be successful or may present new risks;

- acquisitions may divert our management’s attention from the operation of existing businesses;

- the incurrence or assumption of debt and contingent liabilities, which debt may or may not
increase our leverage relative to our EBITDA or equity capitalization;

- the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles;

- an increase in “key man” provisions in our contracts, which could increase the other risks
disclosed herein;

- an increase in write-offs; and

- other acquisition related expenses.

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_Litigation and production issues may harm our business or otherwise distract management._**

Substantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and could
distract our management. For example, lawsuits by broadcasters, licensors or other customers,
consumers, employees, competitors, partners/shareholders or the social or tax administrations could
be very costly and disrupt our business. In addition, we may incur significant litigation costs with
respect to international disputes, particularly if disputes occur in jurisdictions in which we do not
operate or if disputes result in arbitration. While disputes from time to time are not uncommon, we
may not be able to resolve such disputes on terms favorable to us. As a result, members of
management may be distracted from their business roles and we may face substantial expenses and
monetary damages, damage to our reputation and brands, and decreased demand for our content, all of
which could also have a material adverse effect on our business. For a description of certain key
ongoing material litigation, see “Business—Legal Proceedings.” The ultimate outcome of such
proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid.

Legal proceedings in connection with accidents, incidents or misbehavior during the production
process of our programs and formats may also disrupt our business. Certain of our programs are
adventure-based shows, reality shows and physical game shows and may be produced outdoors and in
remote locations. While we take our duty of care owed to participants seriously and always aim to
implement all the necessary security measures, we may not be able to prevent accidents, casualties,
unexpected incidents or misbehavior that may be costly and may significantly impact our business in
terms of image and reputation. For example, in March 2015, two helicopters carrying show
participants and employees of Banijay for the production of Dropped collided in Argentina, causing
the death of all the passengers onboard. Criminal investigations and civil proceedings have been
initiated in Argentina and in France. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.”


-----

In addition, as a producer and distributor of original and third-party media content, we face potential
liability based on a variety of causes of action, including defamation, libel, invasion of privacy,
inappropriate behavior, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement and other claims based on
the nature, content, creation or distribution of such content. These types of claims have been brought
against us and other producers and/or distributors of media content. Our insurance may not be
adequate to cover any such liability that results from any of the foregoing claims. Irrespective of the
validity or the successful assertion of such claims, investigating and defending these types of claims
are expensive and could subject us to significant monetary costs or cause a change in business
practices or reputation that could negatively impact our ability to compete and grow our business.

**_We face risks from doing business internationally._**

We operate over 130 production companies across 21 countries. As a result, our business is subject to
certain risks inherent to international business, many of which are beyond our control. These risks
include:

- issues related to integrating and managing international operations, subsidiaries and
investments;

- potentially adverse tax developments. For example, we benefit from tax incentives in certain
jurisdictions in which we operate and from time to time, we conduct internal reorganizations in
order to leverage the tax incentives available to us. A change in tax regulations may have a
negative impact in our business in these jurisdictions;

- a lack of sufficient protection for intellectual property in some countries;

- territorial restrictions on content licensing;

- currency exchange restrictions, export controls and currency devaluation risks in some foreign
countries;

- compliance with different data protection and anti-corruption regulations;

- the existence in some countries of regulatory or other restrictions that impede the ability of
foreign companies to conduct business in such countries;

- the existence of quotas and other content-related limitations or restrictions (such as government
censorship);

- restrictions on television advertising and marketing;

- issues related to occupational safety and adherence to local labor laws and regulations;

- political or social unrest;

- higher than anticipated costs of entry;

- the presence of corruption in certain countries;

- the absence of good diplomatic relations between the countries in which we operate and certain
other countries;

- rapidly evolving regulatory landscapes relevant to our business;

- the potential for government appropriation of our assets; and

- restrictions on expatriating cash or other assets in some countries (for example, India).


-----

Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_Our ability to generate secondary rights in the content we produce varies from one program to_**
**_another._**

Our ability to capitalize on our programs in forms other than the initial licensing to broadcasters or
digital platforms varies from one program to another. The additional rights that we receive from
content we produce are known as “secondary rights.” In some cases, we have no secondary rights, and
in other cases, we only have the right to distribute them in certain media and territories for a limited
term, depending on the ownership of the format and on our agreement with the broadcaster or digital
platforms. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain worldwide and perpetual rights to our
programs, and any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_Labor disputes involving our own employees may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our_**
**_results of operations._**

Labor regulations may have an impact on our operations. In certain jurisdictions in which we operate,
such as France, the status of participants in reality television programs has been challenged, and such
participants have been recognized as employees, which required us to enter into specific agreements
with them and pay additional associated costs. Our industry relies heavily on freelancers and, in
certain jurisdictions, contracts with freelancers can allow them to claim the status of permanent
employees and to benefit from the rules attached to such status, which has a cost for us. There can be
no assurance that new employment regulations will not significantly impact our business and result in
a material increase in costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
financial condition.

In certain instances, we consult and seek the input of our employee works councils with respect to a
broad range of matters, and certain of our subsidiaries are required to consult works councils to grant
Guarantees under the Indenture. While we generally have been able to successfully consult with our
works councils and we regard our relations with our executives, employees and their representatives
as generally satisfactory, there can be no assurance that this will be the case moving forward. We are
dependent on our ability to have and maintain competitive cost structures in each market in which we
operate while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our executives and employees.
Consultations with works councils, strikes, similar industrial actions or other disturbances by our
workforce could disrupt our operations, result in a loss of reputation, increased wages and benefits or
otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_One of our shareholders holds supermajority voting power._**

Financière LOV controls 71.4% of FLE and its consolidated subsidiaries and owns 45.4% of FLE’s
stock. Other shareholders in FLE include Vivendi (19.2%), SBM International (10.0%), Fimalac
(7.4%), DeA (4.8%) and other minority shareholders (10.7%). FLE directly holds 100% of the share
capital of Banijay Group Holding, the parent company of Banijay, which in turn directly holds 100%
of the share capital of the Issuer. LGI controls Financière LOV and is owned by the Courbit family.
As a result, two companies, Financière LOV and Vivendi, can make all corporate decisions for the
Group. Financière LOV alone, or, as the case may be, together with Vivendi, can decide the election
of directors, the amendment of our bylaws and any approval of mergers, and other significant
corporate transactions. Our controlling shareholders’ actions can affect our strategic decisions, our
legal and capital structure, and our day-to-day operations. In addition, they may have a direct or
indirect interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions that, in their judgment
could enhance their equity interests, even though these transactions may involve risks. In addition,
sales of significant amounts of the Group companies’ shares held by any of the aforementioned
shareholders, or the prospect of these sales, could taint our brand and our value and have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.


-----

**_If we fail to implement our business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be_**
**_materially and adversely affected._**

Our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to
implement our business strategy. Our business strategy involves several initiatives, including
increasing revenues from existing customers, growing our customer base and viewership, pursuing
selected acquisitions and integrating such acquisition targets into our business in a timely fashion, and
attracting and retaining creative talents. We may not be able to implement our business strategy
successfully or achieve the anticipated benefits of our business plan. If we are unable to do so, our
long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some
or all of the initiatives of our business plan successfully, our operating results may not improve to the
extent we anticipate, or at all. In addition, we may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our
business strategy at any time.

Implementation of our initial or revised business strategy could also be affected by a number of
factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government
regulation, general economic conditions, or increased operating costs or expenses. In addition, to the
extent we have misjudged consumer trends in popular culture and media as well as the nature of our
competition, we may have difficulty in achieving our strategic objectives. Any failure to successfully
implement our business strategy may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Some of our productions qualify for audiovisual production subsidies and tax incentives or benefits_**
**_from financing sourced from investors that benefit from tax incentives._**

As an audiovisual production company, we benefit from different sets of subsidies and tax incentives
in France, other European countries (such as the United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain and Italy) and nonEuropean countries (such as Canada, the Republic of Fiji, Australia and the U.S.) which support our
productions (mainly fiction and animation movies). For example, in France, we benefit from
government subsidies and other financial incentives to support the production of documentaries,
fiction, live entertainment, magazines of cultural interest and animation movies. The French
audiovisual fund (Compte de Soutien à l’Industrie des Programmes audiovisuels) automatically
allocates funding to the production, development and writing of pilots under several conditions linked
to the producer acting as the executive producer, the length and cost of the production, language
shooting requirements (whether authors, actors and crews are EU nationals and/or residents in a
Member State) or shooting location. They are capped at a certain percentage of the production budget
and we must obtain prior approval from the National Center of Cinema (Centre National du Cinéma).
We also rely on tax laws and regulations to benefit from tax credits and we monetize those tax credits
in some of the countries in which we operate. For the year ended December 31, 2022, subsidies and
tax incentives related to our audiovisual production company status amounted to approximately €95
million. Changes in tax laws and regulations in the relevant countries may prevent us from benefitting
from these tax credits, partly or at all, and we may not be able to continue to monetize tax credits in
these jurisdictions. Those changes could have a material impact on our results of operations.

We also raise financing from companies dedicated to the financing of cinema and the audiovisual
industry (Sociétés de Financement de l’Industrie Cinématographique et de l’Audiovisuel) in France,
or similar foreign companies in other jurisdictions, which are investment firms that collect private
funds dedicated to finance cinematographic and audiovisual productions by offering a personal
income tax incentive to private individual investors. Our production expenditures benefit from a
favorable amortization regime allowing us to deduct from our taxable basis, under specific conditions,
the net income generated by a specific production in a given financial year. If, at the end of a given
financial year, such income is not sufficient to fully consummate the amortization right that relates to
such production, income arising out of other productions can be used to be offset against the
outstanding amount of amortization allowances. The above subsidies and incentives have a positive
impact on our production costs and capacity to raise financing. Any changes in the conditions


-----

underlying the benefit of these subsidies and incentives may affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of_**
**_operations or financial condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in tax
laws or regulations or in their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, such as our
effective tax rate or tax payments. For example, in the United States, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
enacted at the end of 2017 in the United States imposed a minimum tax, referred to as Base Erosion
Anti-Abuse Tax, to prevent companies with domestic revenue greater than $500 million from
reducing taxable income in the U.S. through payments to related foreign parties that would have been
otherwise deductible such as, for example, interest and royalty payments.

In addition, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to
varying interpretations. For example, the current incorporation into French tax law of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base
erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as
the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in
Paris on June 7, 2017, may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing
structures.

Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the Member States. In
this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a
directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the
internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later
amended on May 29, 2017 by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, _inter_
_alios, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides_
that its provisions apply (subject to certain exceptions), as from January 1, 2020. The ATAD provides,
among others, for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial
expenses is limited to the higher of 30% of the taxpayer’s tax adjusted earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million per year (subject to
several exceptions). All Members States had to transpose these Directives into national legislation and
certain Member States chose to implement the deriving therefrom in a stricter way. In France, these
rules apply since January 1, 2019 following their transposition into French tax law by Article 34 of
the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 2018-1317 of December 28, 2018) (the “French Finance Law
for 2019”). The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) (the “French
Finance Law for 2020”) introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and thus
introduced new anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code (in lieu
of the former French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the French code général des
_impôts (the “French Tax Code”) which were thus repealed)._

In addition, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law, with
effect from January 1, 2019, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to
French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by
specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, which is set forth by Article 205 A of the
French Tax Code, the French tax authorities may ignore, for the determination of corporate income
tax, an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main
purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of
the applicable tax law, are not genuine, taking into consideration all the relevant facts and
circumstances.

The European Commission had also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25,
2016, including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated Corporate
Tax Base (“CCCTB”), (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU
countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems
with double taxation for businesses. In a communication to the European Parliament and the Council


-----

of May 18, 2021 and denominated “Business Taxation for the 21st Century”, the European
Commission announced additional measures in the field of corporate taxation to take into account the
evolution of the context of the EU business taxation policy. In particular, the European Commission
announced that it will propose a new framework for income taxation for businesses in Europe
(“Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation” or “BEFIT”) that will replace the pending
proposals under the CCCTB. BEFIT will be a single corporate tax rulebook for the EU and will
consolidate the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base, which will
then be allocated to member states using a formula and be taxed at national corporate income tax
rates. The preparation for this new proposal will be carried out by the European Commission
alongside the member states and the European Parliament. The European Commission launched a
public consultation on BEFIT in October 2022 opened to all stakeholders until January 2023. The
Commission adoption is planned for third quarter 2023.

The European Commission also published a proposal for a directive creating a Debt Equity Bias
Reduction Allowance (“DEBRA”), aiming at encouraging companies to finance their investment
through equity contributions rather than through debt financing, noting however that in December
2022, the Council of the European Union stated that negotiations would be temporarily suspended and
reassessed at a later stage in the broader context of other upcoming reforms in the area of corporate
taxation.

On October 8, 2021, members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the Inclusive
Framework) agreed to the Statement on the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges
Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy reflecting the agreement reached by 136 out of the
140 Inclusive Framework members. The Two-Pillar Solution is comprised of Pillar One and Pillar
Two. Pillar One aims to ensure a distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect
to the largest multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) through the re-allocation of taxing rights over 25%
of the residual profit of the largest and most profitable MNEs to the jurisdictions where the customers
and users of those MNEs are located.

Pillar Two puts a floor on tax competition on corporate income tax through the introduction of a
global minimum corporate tax at a rate of 15% that countries can use to protect their tax bases (the
GloBE rules). On December 20, 2021, the OECD published the pillar two model rules (the “Model
Rules”) for the domestic implementation of the 15% global minimum tax rate agreed upon in October
2021. The new Model Rules aim to assist countries to bring the GloBE rules into domestic legislation.
They provide for a coordinated system of interlocking rules that (i) define the MNEs within the scope
of the minimum tax; (ii) set out a mechanism for calculating an MNE’s effective tax rate on a
jurisdictional basis, and for determining the amount of top-up tax payable under the rules; and (iii)
determine the member of the MNE group which will be required to pay the top-up tax.

On December 22, 2021, the European Commission published a legislative proposal for a Directive
setting forth rules to ensure a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups. The draft
Directive aims at consistently implementing among all 27 member states the Model Rules that include
an Income Inclusion rule (“IIR”) and an Under Taxed Payment Rule (“UTPR”). However, it also
extends its scope to large-scale purely domestic groups, in order to ensure compliance with the
European Union fundamental freedoms. In addition, the draft Directive makes use of an option
contemplated by the Inclusive Framework whereby the member state of a low-taxed income entity
applying the IIR is required to ensure effective taxation at the minimum agreed level not only for
foreign subsidiaries but also for all constituent entities residents in that member State. The Directive
was adopted by the EU member states on December 15, 2022, and member states have until
December 31, 2023 to transpose the Directive into national legislation, noting that the IIR should be
applicable in EU member states for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2023 and the UTPR
should apply to fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2024.

On January 17, 2023, the European Parliament approved the directive proposal to neutralize the
misuse of shell entities for improper tax purposes within the European Union (the “ATAD III
Proposal”), which was released by the European Commission on December 22, 2021. To be


-----

definitively adopted, the text will need to be approved by the Council of the European Union and
subsequently implemented by the Member States. Even if the European Council has targeted an
application of this directive as from January 1, 2024, the final content, exact timing for the vote and
the directive’s implementation by the Member States remains unclear at this stage.

We are monitoring these different regulations as they develop and are transposed into applicable law
to the extent they could impact our tax position in the future. Finally, we often rely on generally
available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including
to benefit from various tax credits. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in
agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax
authorities, or if we are unable to retain any favorable tax rulings, the imposition of additional taxes
could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our
products or services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and
have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_A substantial amount of our assets represents goodwill and other intangible assets, and our_**
**_earnings will be reduced if our goodwill becomes impaired._**

Goodwill is generated in acquisitions where the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets we acquire. Goodwill is subject to an impairment analysis at
least annually based on a comparison of the recoverable value of the cash generating unit or group of
cash generating units to which the goodwill relates and the carrying value of that cash generating
unit(s), or more frequently when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not
be recoverable. In addition, as part of our business activities, we develop, acquire and hold certain
intangible assets related to, among others, broadcast rights, trademarks and other content-related
assets, which are also subject to impairment. For example, if we are unable to recover any advances
made in connection with our distribution business, such distribution advances would be subject to
impairment. As of June 30, 2023, our goodwill represented €2,501 million, or 48.8% of our total
assets, and this amount may increase following the purchase price allocation of Balich. We could be
required to recognize expenses in our consolidated income statement caused by the impairment of
goodwill or other intangible assets, which if significantly impaired, could materially and adversely
affect our results of operations. Any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may
result in material reductions of our income and equity under IFRS and have a negative effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by Run-Rate
Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate
Adjusted EBITDA margin.

In addition, this information includes certain financial data related to the historical operations of
companies acquired over the relevant periods to provide more granularity regarding the performance
of such businesses after adjusting for additions to our scope of consolidation. In certain cases, this


-----

data has been calculated in reliance on management accounts, financial due diligence reports and/or
audited and unaudited financial statements of the acquired companies, and may involve significant
assumptions, including assumptions related to the realization of certain cost reductions and synergies.
These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any
independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties related
to the implementation of the initiatives and business and operating performance. It may not give an
accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired
businesses, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial
information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an
investment decision.

**_Changes to accounting standards may affect our reporting of our financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. Any
changes in these accounting standards may have a significant impact on our financial condition and
results from operations. In particular, there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations
which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”), which make
IFRS standards subject to change. Certain IFRS standards have been recently revised by the IASB.
Furthermore, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could
significantly affect our financial results. IFRS and related accounting pronouncements,
implementation guidelines and interpretations with regards to a wide range of matters that are relevant
to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets,
leases and related economic transactions, intangibles, self-insurance, income taxes, property and
equipment, litigation and equity-based compensation, are highly complex and involve many
subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us. Changes in these rules or their interpretation
or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could require us to make changes
to our accounting systems to implement these changes that could increase our operating costs, and
could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.

**_Changes to the regulatory environment in which we operate could adversely affect our results of_**
**_operations or financial condition._**

We operate over 130 production companies across 21 countries. As a result, we are subject to
numerous, rapidly evolving and complex laws and regulations which govern, among others, labor
matters, financial reporting standards, corporate governance, tax, and competitive practices in each
jurisdiction where we conduct our business. We may fail to comply with various local standards and
practices of different regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative bodies specific to each jurisdiction in
which we operate, or fail to keep pace with legislative changes in any of these areas. In addition, a
number of laws and regulations we are subject to regulate broadcasters’ activities, and impose rules
regarding the production of the content they can air. Changes in such laws and regulations could lead
to a withdrawal or cancellation of our broadcasters’ licenses, which would in turn prevent us from
transacting with the relevant broadcasters. Any of the foregoing could have a negative effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Risks Related to Our Capital Structure**

**_The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies that have no revenue-generating_**
**_operations of their own and will depend on cash from the operating companies of our Group to be_**
**_able to make payments on the Notes or the Guarantees._**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are holding companies with no business operations other than the
equity interests and/or intercompany receivables they hold in each of their subsidiaries. The Issuer and
such Guarantors will be dependent upon the cash flow from their operating subsidiaries in the form of
dividends, interest payments on intercompany loans or other distributions to meet their obligations,
including their obligations under the Notes or the Guarantees. If the subsidiaries of the Issuer do not


-----

fulfill their obligations under certain intercompany loans to make scheduled payments or provide
other permitted distributions to the Issuer, the Issuer may not have any other source of funds that
would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes. The amounts of such payments,
dividends and other distributions available to the Issuer and such Guarantors will depend on the
profitability and cash flow of their respective subsidiaries as well as the ability of those subsidiaries to
declare dividends under applicable law. The subsidiaries of the Issuer and such Guarantors, however,
may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions, make interest
payments on, or otherwise advance upstream loans to the Issuer or such Guarantors in order to make
payments in respect of their debt, including the Notes and the Guarantees. While the Indenture will
limit the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay
dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant
qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law. In
addition, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make
payments with respect to the Notes.

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

We currently have, and after completion of the Transactions, we will continue to have, a significant
amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of June 30, 2023, our as
adjusted net financial debt, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, would have been €2,408
million, which reflects external interest-bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
See “Capitalization.” In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to
€170.0 million (equivalent). Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our
business and operations and for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the Senior
Facilities and other debt and liabilities we may incur;

- requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on
our debt, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions or organic growth
projects and for other general corporate purposes;

- increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry
conditions;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or
greater financial resources than we have;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and
industry;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

- restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or taking advantage of certain business
opportunities; and

- limiting, among others, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future
and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes, the guarantees in respect of the Existing
Senior Notes and the Senior Facilities. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to
fund acquisitions, working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our future
operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from
operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors
and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow


-----

from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or to fund our future acquisitions or other
working capital expenditures.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including debt in
connection with future acquisitions. The terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
permit and the Indenture will permit our subsidiaries to do so, although in each case subject to certain
limitations. If we incur new indebtedness in addition to our current indebtedness, the risks associated
with our leverage would intensify. For a discussion of our cash flow and liquidity, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Liquidity and Capital_
_Resources.”_

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service_**
**_our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We have the ability to borrow up to €170.0
million (equivalent) under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement permit and the Indenture will also permit us to incur additional debt thereunder. The
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement also permits and the Indenture will permit us to incur a
substantial amount of indebtedness at the level of subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to
incur indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over assets that
do not secure the Notes. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be structurally or effectively senior
to the Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes or secure the Notes, and
other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement contains and the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and
exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to the Issuer’s and its
subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase and such debt may
have substantially the same covenants as, or covenants that are more restrictive than, those under the
Indenture or the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement does not and the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do
not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. The incurrence of additional debt would increase
the leverage-related risks described in this offering memorandum.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants which limit our operating, strategic and financial flexibility._**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement contains and the Indenture will contain, as applicable,
covenants which impose significant restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions on
our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures or undertaking
capital expenditures;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- create unrestricted subsidiaries;

- agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions;

- sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;


-----

- sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis;

- issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries;

- impair the security interests granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

- create or incur certain liens.

These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to
market conditions or regulatory developments or take advantage of potential business opportunities as
they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations,
pursue future acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital
needs or such acquisitions.

**_Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or_**
**_the Indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default_**
**_that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations._**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative
covenants as long as amounts under the Senior Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore, the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios in connection
with the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to a financial covenant. This financial covenant will be
tested quarterly in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities
_Agreement.” Our ability to satisfy these ratios could be affected by any deterioration in our operating_
results, as well as by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will be able to
satisfy these ratios. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement includes certain events of default
(including, among others, events of default for breaches of representations and warranties and for our
failure to make principal payments when due on certain other debt) that are in addition to the events
of default that will be set forth in the Indenture. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, including our failure to comply with the financial
covenant under the Revolving Credit Facility, could result in an event of default under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a payment event of default that is
continuing under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, subject to the applicable cure
period, and upon the acceleration of indebtedness with respect to any other event of default by the
creditors under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the relevant creditors could, among
others, terminate any available facilities, cancel any undrawn commitments and elect to declare all
amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and
payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Facilities, including our failure to comply with the
financial covenant under the Revolving Credit Facility, could lead to an event of default and
acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions,
including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities, accelerate
the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries
would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy the other liabilities of our subsidiaries
that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if
we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any of the Collateral that is
granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to refinance indebtedness maturing prior to the_**
**_stated maturity of the Notes or to repay the Notes at maturity._**

The Notes offered hereby will mature in 2029. The EUR Term Loan B1 and the USD Term Loan B1
will mature in 2028. The Existing Senior Notes will mature in 2026. In addition, certain of our other
third-party indebtedness (including payments under earn-outs and put options in the amount of €159.3
million as of June 30, 2023, payments of which will not be regulated pursuant to the Indenture, and
share-based payments) that will remain outstanding following the Transactions will be terminated or


-----

repayable prior to the maturity of the Notes, and the prior maturity of such other third-party
indebtedness may make it difficult to refinance the Notes offered hereby. As a result, we may not
have sufficient cash to repay all amounts owing on the Notes, the EUR Term Loan B1 and the USD
Term Loan B1 at maturity. In addition, if our access to capital markets or our ability to enter into new
financing arrangements is inhibited or reduced for any reason, including due to factors beyond our
control, we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt or sustain our operations,_**
**_including due to factors beyond our control, and we may need to take other actions to satisfy our_**
**_debt obligations, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make payments on or to refinance the Notes, the Senior Facilities or our other debt
obligations, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating
performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends on general economic, financial,
competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt
obligations, and additional debt financing and equity may not be available to us in an amount
sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the repayment at maturity of Notes and/or
the then-outstanding amount under the Senior Facilities, or to refinance such debt, including the
Notes, or to fund our liquidity needs.

If our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay obligations
as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may need to:

- reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms,
if at all.

Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such
time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may
require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business
operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the Indenture and the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In
addition, we may be unable to find alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative
financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able to
refinance our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at
all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes and the Senior
Facilities. In that event, borrowings under other debt agreement or instruments that contain crossdefault or cross-acceleration provisions may become payable on demand, and we may not have
sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including the Notes and the Senior Facilities.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding debt on a timely
basis would likely result in a reduction of our external public ratings, which could harm our ability to
incur additional debt. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt
service and other obligations. The terms of our debt, including under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement and the Indenture, restrict or will restrict (as applicable) our ability to transfer or
sell assets. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or obtain the funds that we could


-----

have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset
dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations when due.

**_Tax legislation, tax audits or disputes and our results may restrict our ability to use tax loss carry-_**
**_forwards, and/or deduct interest and the services that we provide are subject to value added taxes_**
**_and sales taxes that may increase._**

We may record deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting from
discrepancies between the tax and accounting valuation of the assets and liabilities or in respect of tax
loss carry-forwards from our entities. The actual realization of these assets in future years depends on
tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the future results of the relevant
entities. In particular, pursuant to Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the French Tax Code, the fraction of
French tax loss carry-forwards that may be used to offset the taxable profit with respect to a given
fiscal year is limited to €1.0 million plus 50% of the portion of taxable profit exceeding €1.0 million.
Similar rules apply to tax losses generated by French tax consolidated groups. As of December 31,
2022, we had recorded tax loss carry-forwards, notably in France and Italy. The French tax loss carryforwards have been reflected in our Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31,
2022, resulting in the amount of €44.0 million of deferred tax assets corresponding to the portion of
tax loss carry-forwards that we expect to offset against operating profits in the following fiscal years.
Any reduction in our ability to use these assets due to changes in laws and regulations, potential tax
reassessment or lower than expected results could have a negative impact on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Moreover, French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for tax purposes, of all or a portion of
the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service
our indebtedness. As a general rule, pursuant to Article 39, 1-1° of the French Tax Code, expenses
incurred by a French company are deductible provided, among others, that (i) they are incurred in its
direct corporate interest and (ii) they correspond to actual and justified expenses. In this respect,
French case law has developed the concept of “abnormal act of management,” according to which the
expenses incurred by a French company, in relation with transactions that are not aligned with its
direct corporate interest, are not tax deductible. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French
Tax Code, which has transposed the ATAD into French domestic law, the deductibility of net
financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i)
€3 million and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (the “30% Limitation”). Such
limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these
financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. Companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio
of their net equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level
of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong can, provided they are not thinly
capitalized, deduct net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation up to 75% of their amount.

A company will be deemed thinly capitalized if the amount of its related party debt exceeds a ratio of
1.5 times the company’s net equity. In this situation, its net financial expenses are deductible for a
portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million,
multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by
non-related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5 time
the company’s net equity by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the
company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their
amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of the company’s adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied
by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related
parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5 time the company’s
net equity by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company
during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these amended
thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall
indebtedness ratio of the consolidated group to which it belongs, as determined under accounting
consolidation rules (i.e., the ratio existing between the total amount of the consolidated group’s debts
(with the exception of those owed to companies belonging to the consolidated group) and the amount


-----

of the consolidated group’s net equity), is higher than or equal to its own indebtedness ratio (i.e., the
ratio existing between the total amount of its debts and the amount of its net equity).

Where a borrowing company is a member of a French tax consolidated group, (i) the 30% Limitation
is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by the French tax group and
(ii) the 1.5 debt-to-equity ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis at the level of the French tax
group perimeter pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing
consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the
meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code which do not belong to the same tax consolidated
group. Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward
indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of
financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million
threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused
interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal
years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that
this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities.

The French tax rules on deductibility, as well as generally applicable tax principles, and specific tax
rules and principles applicable in other jurisdictions in which the Group operates, may limit the
Group’s ability to deduct interest accrued on the Group’s indebtedness incurred in France and, as a
consequence, may increase the Group’s tax burden, which could adversely affect the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the cash flow available to service
the Group’s indebtedness.

Finally, the services we provide to certain of our customers are subject to value-added taxes, sales
taxes or other similar taxes. Specific reduced VAT rates are also applicable to our services when they
relate to the sale of economic rights recognized in law to authors and performers as well as the sale of
broadcasting rights to audiovisual works. Tax rates may increase at any time and, subject to the ability
of our customers to recover such taxes, any such increase could affect our business and the demand
for our services, and thereby reduce our operating profit, negatively affecting our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flow available to service our indebtedness.

**_To repay or refinance and service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash._**

Our ability to make payments on principal or interest when due on our indebtedness, including the
Notes and the Senior Facilities, will depend upon our future performance and our ability to generate
cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. The ability of our
subsidiaries to transfer funds upstream to us, pay operating expenses and fund planned capital
expenditures and any future acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures and research and
development efforts will depend on our businesses’ ability to generate cash in the future, as well as
limitations that may be imposed under applicable law. This is subject, to an extent, to general
economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, including those factors
discussed in this “Risk Factors” section or elsewhere in this offering memorandum, many of which
are beyond our and our subsidiaries’ control. If we sustain losses in the future, our ability to repay and
service our debt may be materially impaired.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our payment obligations, we may be forced
to reduce or delay planned expansions or capital expenditures, sell significant assets, discontinue
specified operations, obtain additional funding in the form of debt or equity capital or attempt to
restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that
we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on commercially
reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement and the Notes, limit or will limit (as applicable) our ability to pursue these
alternatives. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet
our obligations.

**_The adoption by the Council of the European Union of an EU list of non-cooperative jurisdiction_**
**_for tax purposes and the use of this list in the jurisdictions where we operate may impact our_**
**_financial results._**

The Council of the European Union adopted on December 5, 2017 its conclusions on the EU list of
non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (the “Council Conclusions”) which is composed of two
sub-lists (respectively, the “Black List” and the “Grey List,” together referred to as the “EU List”).
The Black List is currently (according to the list as of February 14, 2023) composed of sixteen
jurisdictions (American Samoa, Anguilla, the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, Fiji,
Guam, Marshall Islands, Palau, Panama, Russia, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States
Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands and Vanuatu). Furthermore, the Council published a
Grey List of screened jurisdictions that committed to introduce changes in their tax legislation in order
to comply with the European Union screening criteria. Though there is no applicable sanction yet,
Member States are encouraged by the Council Conclusions to agree on coordinated sanctions to apply
at national level against these listed jurisdictions, such as increased monitoring and audits,
withholding taxes, special documentation requirements and anti-abuse provisions.

A French law that aims at fighting fraud was published on October 24, 2018 (Law 2018-898 of
October 23, 2018) and expands under certain conditions the French tax regime regarding the noncooperative states and jurisdictions as defined under Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code to
certain states and jurisdictions included into the Black List. As a result, interest paid or accrued to
persons domiciled or established in certain states and jurisdictions included into the Black List or paid
on an account opened in a financial institution located in such States and jurisdictions may be subject
to withholding tax in France and not be deductible for purposes of the computation of the debtor’s
corporate income tax liability, where such States or jurisdictions are included into the French list of
non-cooperative states and jurisdictions. These provisions apply to such States and jurisdictions as
from the first day of the third month following the publication of the order _(arrêté) including such_
States and jurisdictions on this French list. The most recent French list, published by the French
government on February 5, 2023, includes the American Samoa, Anguilla, Bahamas, Fiji, Guam,
Palau, Panama, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, the Turk and Caicos Islands, the United States Virgin
Islands and Vanuatu, as well as the British Virgin Islands, and Seychelles.

###### In the Netherlands, similar anti-abuse rules have been implemented, as a result of which payments of interest and royalties may be subject to a 25.8% Dutch withholding tax if such payments are made or deemed to be made to related entities (within the meaning of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021) if such related entities are considered to be resident in a jurisdiction that is listed in the yearly updated Dutch Regulation on low-taxing states and non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (Regeling laagbelastende staten en niet- coöperatieve rechtsgebieden voor belastingdoeleinden) (a “Listed Jurisdiction”) or have a permanent establishment located in a Listed Jurisdiction to which the interest or royalty payment is attributable. From January 1, 2024, dividends distributed to related entities resident in a Listed Jurisdiction or having a permanent establishment located in a Listed Jurisdiction to which the dividend is attributable also fall within the scope of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 and may therefore be subject to a 25.8% conditional Dutch withholding tax.

**_French insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States_**
**_or other countries._**

We conduct a major part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the center of our
main interests is deemed to be in France, we could be subject to French insolvency proceedings
affecting creditors, including court-assisted pre-insolvency proceedings (mandat ad hoc proceedings
(procédure de mandat ad hoc) or conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation)), courtcontrolled insolvency proceedings (safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde)), accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) and reorganization or liquidation


-----

proceedings (redressement ou liquidation judiciaire). In general, French insolvency legislation favors
the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could
limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_A noteholder’s effective yield on the Notes may be diminished by the tax impact on that noteholder_**
**_of its investment in the Notes._**

Payments of interest on the Notes, or profits realized by the noteholder upon the sale or repayment of
the Notes, may be subject to taxation in the noteholder’s home jurisdiction or in other jurisdictions in
which it is required to pay taxes. Certain French and U.S. tax matters relating to an investment in the
Notes are summarized under “Certain Tax Considerations”; however, that section does not contain a
comprehensive description of the tax impact of an investment in the Notes and the tax impact on an
individual noteholder may differ from the impact described in that section. Tax regulations and their
application by the relevant taxation authorities are subject to change from time to time and it is not
possible to predict the precise tax treatment at any given time. The Issuer advises all investors to
contact their own tax advisors for advice on the tax impact of an investment in the Notes.

**_Transactions in the Notes could be subject to the European financial transaction tax, if adopted._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive for a common
financial transactions tax (the “FTT”) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (together, except for Estonia, the “Participating Member
States”) and which, if enacted and implemented by France, would replace the French FTT. Following
the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (the “ECOFIN”) meeting of December 8, 2015, Estonia
officially announced its withdrawal from the negotiations and, on March 16, 2016, completed the
formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on FTT. The Commission’s proposal has a
very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in Notes
(including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

At the ECOFIN meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented on the
basis of a note prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019, indicating a consensus among the Participating
Member States to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the
French financial transactions tax model which in principle would only concern shares of listed
companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is
still subject to change until a final approval. In February 2021, the Portuguese Presidency of the
Council of the European Union proposed an inclusive discussion among all Member States on tax
design issues of the FTT. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating
Member States, the potential adoption of such tax and its scope being therefore uncertain. Additional
Member States may decide to participate and certain of the Participating Member States may decide
to withdraw. If the proposed directive or any similar taxes are adopted, such taxes could increase the
transaction costs associated with the purchases and sales of the Notes and could reduce liquidity in the
market for the Notes.

**_Changes in, or uncertainty relating to, the benchmark calculation process may increase our costs_**
**_and reduce our cash flow._**

The Senior Facilities bear interest at interest rates based on EURIBOR, compounded Sterling Over
Night Index Average (“SONIA”) and/or Term SOFR (depending on whether a loan under those
facilities is denominated in euro, sterling or U.S. dollars); in the case of EURIBOR, SONIA (save that
in the case of compounded SONIA, only if the aggregate of SONIA and the credit adjustment spread
is less than zero) and Term SOFR (in connection with any loan under the Revolving Credit Facility),
these are subject to a zero floor, and otherwise in the case of Term SOFR applicable to the USD Term
Loan B1, this is subject to a one per cent. floor, which are deemed to be “benchmarks” and have been
the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some
reforms are already effective including the Benchmarks Regulations and the cessation of the
publication of the sterling LIBOR benchmark and the U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmark. Separately, the


-----

euro risk free rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding principles and high
level recommendations for fallback provisions in, among others, new euro denominated cash products
(including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among others, that
continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may
increase the risk to the euro area financial system. These reforms and recommendations may cause
such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other
consequences which cannot be predicted.

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 and the Benchmarks (Amendment and Transitional Provision) (EU Exit)
Regulations 2019 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to
the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a
benchmark within the EU and the United Kingdom. Among others, it (i) requires benchmark
administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU- or UK-based, to be subject to an
equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU- and UKsupervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if nonEU- or UK-based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed).

The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the Senior Facilities if the methodology
or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the
Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among others, have the effect of reducing, increasing or
otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. More
broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of
benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the
setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements.

It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, the various benchmarks will
continue to be supported going forward. This may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than
in the past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Such factors may have
(without limitation) the following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants
from continuing to administer or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or
methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark.
Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national
reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported
benchmarks, which could have an adverse impact on the interest we pay on borrowings under the
Senior Facilities. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, including as a result of
changing macro-economic conditions, our interest expense could correspondingly increase, thereby
reducing our cash flow and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. None of the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture contains or will contain (as applicable) a
covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we expect to enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion
of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be or will continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including credit risk in relation to
such hedging counterparties and the risk that we may need to pay a significant amount (including
costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly,
our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. If one or more of our
counterparties falls into bankruptcy, any claims we have under hedging arrangements may become
worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate any such
hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees may adversely_**
**_affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes and of the Collateral._**

Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against a Guarantor will be subject to certain laws
applicable, and defenses available, to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. The
Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of France, the United States, England and Wales, the


-----

Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Australia, Germany and Italy. Future Guarantors may be incorporated
in other jurisdictions. Although laws differ in these jurisdictions, applicable laws and defenses may
include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, corporate purpose
or benefit, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, preservation of share capital,
thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulations or defenses affecting the rights
of creditors generally. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

In France, the enforcement of the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral is limited to
the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured over such Collateral, as applicable, under the
applicable laws of France, to the extent that the granting of such a Guarantee or security interest in the
Collateral is not in the grantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such security interest exceeds the
benefit to the relevant grantor, or such guarantee or security interest would be in breach of capital
maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and would cause the
directors of such subsidiary grantor, in certain jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary duties and
incur civil or criminal liability.

In France, the liabilities and obligations under the Guarantees and the security interests in the
Collateral are subject to (i) certain exceptions, including any obligations which, if incurred, would
constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L.225-216 of the French Code
_de Commerce or infringement of the provisions of Articles L.242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Code de_
_Commerce; and (ii) a financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the_
Offering which the Issuer has applied for the direct benefit of each French Guarantor through
intercompany loans. By virtue of this limitation, each French Guarantor’s obligations under the
Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral could be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Notes or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the
Guarantee and the security interest in the Collateral. French law requires that, when a French
company grants a guarantee of third-party obligations, the guarantee must be in the corporate purpose
and corporate interest of the guarantor company. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the
guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are
matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

The Guarantees given by the Guarantors incorporated in Italy will be limited by reference to (i)
corporate benefit, which determines, inter alios, a financial limitation on the guaranteed amount and
(ii) financial assistance, within the meaning of within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case
may be, of the Italian Civil Code. In addition, the Guarantees given by the Guarantors incorporated in
Italy must be limited to an expressly identified maximum amount. Furthermore, any obligation
guaranteed by any Guarantor incorporated in Italy, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory
or public policy rules including, inter alios, any obligation to pay any portion of interest exceeding the
thresholds of the interest rate permitted under Italian Law No. 108 of March 7, 1996, as amended
from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations, may not be enforceable. There is
therefore a risk that the holders of the Notes will, upon enforcement, be unable to realize the full value
of the Guarantee granted by the Guarantors incorporated in Italy.

The Guarantees given by the Guarantors incorporated in Denmark will be limited by reference to
corporate benefit and similar principles. There is therefore a risk that the holders of the Notes will,
upon enforcement, be unable to realize the full value of the Guarantees due to corporate benefit
restrictions. Furthermore, in respect of the Guarantees given by the Guarantors incorporated in
Denmark, the corporate benefit limitations on enforcement against a given Guarantor incorporated in
Denmark operate as a single limit applicable to all classes of creditors benefitting from that
Guarantee. If there are classes of creditors ranking prior to the holders of the Notes in respect of the
Guarantees, there is therefore a risk that the potential recovery of the holders of the Notes under the
Guarantees is further limited as prior-ranking creditors exhaust (in part or in full) the recovery
permitted under applicable corporate benefit limitations.

**_The interests of our controlling shareholder may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the_**
**_Notes._**

FLE directly holds 100% of the share capital of Banijay Group Holding, the parent company of
Banijay, which in turn directly holds 100% of the share capital of the Issuer. As a result, FLE has,
directly or indirectly, the power to affect, among others, our legal and capital structure and our day-today operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other
changes to our operations. In addition, in order to comply with certain restrictive covenants, we will
depend upon the cooperation of our controlling shareholder, who has the power to effect compliance
with such covenants. The interests of our controlling shareholder and its affiliates could conflict with
the interests of holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to
pay our debts when due. Our controlling shareholder also has an interest in pursuing divestitures,
financings or other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its equity investments, although
such transactions might involve risks to holders of the Notes. In addition, our controlling shareholder
may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with ours or do business with us.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_The Notes may not be initially secured by all of the Collateral and not all of the Guarantors will_**
**_initially guarantee the Notes._**

On the Issue Date, and until up to 60 days after the Issue Date, the Notes may not be secured by all of
the Collateral, as further described under “Description of the Notes—Security.” Subject to the Agreed
Security Principles and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, on the Issue Date, the Notes will be
secured by the Issue Date Collateral. The security interests will be limited to the same extent as those
under the Senior Facilities and otherwise as set forth under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests,”_
which limitations could be significant. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and
_other limitations on the Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees of the Notes and of the Collateral.” If a guarantee or a security interest granted by a_
Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose, such
guarantee or security interest may be subject to claw-back provisions under applicable local
insolvency laws. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantor, which is a
guarantor under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. The Notes will be guaranteed by the
Post-Closing Date Guarantors, all of which are guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, within 60 days from the Issue Date, provided that such guarantees are in all cases subject
to the Agreed Security Principles. We will agree in the Indenture to take such necessary actions so
that the Post-Closing Date Guarantors become guarantors of the Notes by executing and delivering to
the Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to the Indenture. The
Guarantees will be limited as set forth in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as_**
**_security for the Notes and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not secure_**
**_the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured, as applicable, only to the extent of the value of the Collateral described in
this offering memorandum. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” The Collateral secures the
Notes and the Senior Facilities on a pari passu basis, and may secure additional debt ranking senior to
or pari passu with the respective series of Notes and the Guarantees thereof to the extent permitted by
the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, a portion of the Collateral also
secures the Existing Senior Notes on a second priority basis. The rights of the holders of the Notes
may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the
Collateral. If the value of the assets pledged as Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the


-----

holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our assets will
secure the Notes, and the Indenture will allow the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure
certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Indenture with the property and assets of the
restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be
significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes
and the Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt.

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

If we default on the Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the
assets underlying the Collateral. In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of
the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient
to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral
has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will
also depend on many factors, including, among others, whether or not the business is sold as a going
concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly
sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers.
See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Security Interests—France—Limitations on Enforcement of Security Interests and_
_Cash Amount (soulte).”_

The shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes
may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such Collateral may not
be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure
you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the
liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France,
include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that
are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business
operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such
assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security
Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain
jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be
challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all.
As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the
value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries
pledged to secure, inter alios, the Notes and the Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value
in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares
that have been pledged, because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged
must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the
creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the
case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the
proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the
Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a
senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of
the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties
benefit from liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security
Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral
which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.
Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of such Notes would benefit from
the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to
benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral and the sale of particular_**
**_assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**


-----

The Security Documents relating to the Collateral will allow the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other
Collateral providers to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and
collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets.
So long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the other Collateral providers may, among others, without any release or consent by
the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling,
factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash
payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The recovery from the enforcement of the share pledges forming part of the Collateral may be_**
**_complicated, involve long recovery times and a low recovery rate._**

In connection with the enforcement of share pledges over shares of entities with outstanding debt
obligations, any sale of such entities is likely to involve a release of some or all of the debt of such
entity, which could result in a taxable capital gain to such entities. Banijay and certain of the
Guarantors will grant share pledges over shares of certain of their respective subsidiaries as part of the
Collateral. Certain of those subsidiaries have indebtedness. An enforcement over such shares for the
holders of the Notes would involve the enforcement over the share pledge of an entity with
outstanding debt claims. In addition, such subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future in
compliance with the Indenture. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over any such
subsidiary’s shares may result in the release of its debt obligations. Such release is permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement and could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to
reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the value
of the pledge over the shares of any subsidiary of Banijay that forms part of the Collateral and has
outstanding primary debt obligations (or which has subsidiaries of its own with primary debt
obligations) may be limited.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture. The existence of any such exceptions,
defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral
securing the Notes as well as the ability of the Trustee to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.

The security interests of the Security Agent are subject to practical problems generally associated with
the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the Trustee or the Security Agent
may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you
that it will be possible to obtain any such consents, nor can we assure you that the consents of any
third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the
Trustee or the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of
the Collateral may significantly decrease.

Furthermore, under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can
only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured
party or the grantor of the security. The liens in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the
claims of the Notes if we, the Trustee or the Security Agent fails or is unable to take the actions we
are or it is required, as the case may be, to take to perfect any of these liens.

**_If the Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the_**
**_terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and_**
**_counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred_**
**_under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the_**
**_Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the_**
**_Collateral in priority over the Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement
of the Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after


-----

certain events, including the acceleration of the Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turnedover amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions towards
discharging the super senior obligations (including, among others, (following the designation of the
Revolving Credit Facility as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement) those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and future
indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior basis (the “Super Senior Liabilities”)) in priority
to applying any such amounts towards discharging the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of
the Collateral, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under such
Super Senior Liabilities are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an
enforcement sale of Collateral will, after all obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been
discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Senior Facilities, the Notes, (if the Revolving
Credit Facility has not been designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement) the Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that ranks _pari_
_passu with the Notes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—The_
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

While the Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional
security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of
future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to the Agreed Security
Principles. The Agreed Security Principles set forth in the Indenture set out a number of limitations on
the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security or guarantees in certain circumstances.
The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount
recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular
type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the
security or guarantees provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors.

**_You may be required to pay a cash amount (soulte) in the event you decide to enforce a pledge over_**
**_securities granted under French law by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral_**
**_consisting of securities rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor of payment obligations up to the
secured amount that is due and unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the
form of a pledge over a securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts
_sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale_
of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured
creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure
(pacte commissoire) of the Collateral to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors
become the legal owner of the Collateral. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of
foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be
deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed Collateral. Such value is determined either by
the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a precontractually agreed expert in the context
of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the
secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference
between the value of the Notes as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true
regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a
subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

**_The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes,_**
**_or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance_**
**_periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or
voidance periods for such Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of
shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or
voidance periods in particular, as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted
in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future


-----

debt. The applicable hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the
moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest
granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period
applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to
enforce it. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of
further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant
assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral_**

The liens on the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the
Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens.
Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any
obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. For example, in
France, share pledges over the shares of French subsidiaries that are governed by French law consist
of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres) in which the relevant shares
are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement
of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor
of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant
shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and the shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres)
of each French Guarantor. Additionally, in France, no lien searches are available for security interests
that are not publicly registered, with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a
security interest if it is not publicly registered. Additional perfection formalities exist in other
jurisdictions where security interests will be granted. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” for_
further discussion.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees thereof or the Collateral_**
**_across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of France; the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
France, the United States, England and Wales, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Australia, Germany
and Italy, in each of which jurisdiction proceedings could be initiated to enforce your rights under the
Notes or the Guarantees. The Notes will also be secured by security interests in the Collateral
consisting of assets located in Australia, France, England and Wales, the United States and the
Netherlands.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries
experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings.

In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be
initiated in any of these jurisdictions. In addition, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court
that shall have jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in relation to a debtor is the court of
the Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has its “center of main interests” (“COMI”).
Therefore, to the extent that COMI of the Issuer or any Guarantor is deemed to be in a particular
European jurisdiction, the courts of such jurisdiction may have jurisdiction over the insolvency
proceedings with respect to it, irrespective of its jurisdiction of incorporation. For a brief description
of certain aspects of insolvency law in the European Union and various jurisdictions in the European
Union, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_


-----

Proceedings could also be initiated in Australia, France, England and Wales, the United States and the
Netherlands to enforce your rights against Collateral located in those jurisdictions. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result
in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. There can also be no
assurance that you will be able to enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among
them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect
your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in those
jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes._**

The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security
Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the
Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the
Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as
principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture.

Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized the enforceability in France
of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent
benefiting from a Parallel Debt (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère (“Belvédère”)
relating to New-York law governed bond documentation, there can be no assurance that such a
structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, this decision should not be
considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent
benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will
eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the
Collateral created for the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel
Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In
addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee will act in a fiduciary capacity and have certain assigned duties and rights under the
Indenture that become particularly important following defaults or events of default. The concept of
“trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French High Court (Cour de cassation)
in Belvédère, which has held that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the
State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in
France. However, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985, on the law applicable
to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized
under French law.

The Security Documents are granted for the benefit of the Security Agent, among others. To the
extent that the security interests in the Collateral created for the benefit of the Security Agent are
successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive any
proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the
Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the respective
Security Agent. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically and under which_**
**_the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or any action on the part of the_**
**_Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral will be released automatically, including the following:

- upon release of a Guarantee (with respect to the lien securing such Guarantee);


-----

- subject to certain conditions, in connection with any disposition of Collateral, other than to the
Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries, permitted by the Indenture;

- if the Issuer designates any Guarantor to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property, assets and capital stock of such
unrestricted subsidiary;

- defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “Description of the Notes—Defeasance”
and “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture; and

- as may be permitted by the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”_

In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantees will be released automatically, including the
following:

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of capital stock of
the relevant Guarantor, such that such Guarantor ceases to be a restricted subsidiary, or the sale
or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the relevant Guarantor (including by way of
merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) (other than to the Issuer or a restricted
subsidiary), in each case in a transaction otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

- in the case of a Guarantee of a Guarantor, the designation in accordance with the Indenture of
the relevant Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

- defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “Description of the Notes—Defeasance”
and “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”

See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes.”

In addition, the Guarantees and security interests will be subject to release upon a distressed disposal
as contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. However, unless consented to, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights
to release the Guarantees or the liabilities in respect of the Existing Senior Notes unless the relevant
sale or disposal is made:

- for consideration all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash; and

- either (1) pursuant to a competitive sales process or (2) following the issue of a fairness opinion
with respect to the amount received in connection with such sale from an independent
investment bank or internationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Security Agent.

See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Description of the Notes.”

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to_**
**_creditors, including investors in the Notes, as the insolvency laws of the jurisdictions with which_**
**_you are familiar, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees_**
**_or the security interests in the Collateral._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are organized
and existing respectively under the laws of France, England and Wales, the Netherlands, Denmark,
Spain, Australia, Germany and Italy. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event,
proceedings could be initiated in France, England and Wales, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain,


-----

Australia, Germany and Italy. The bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of a
Guarantor’s or the Issuer’s jurisdiction of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict
with, those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, the priority of
governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-commencement interest and the duration
of the proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and
conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of
judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against
the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security
interests in the Collateral. The court may also in certain circumstances void the security interest or the
Guarantees where the debtor is close to or near insolvency.

Under English insolvency law, among others, a liquidator or administrator of an English company
could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if
such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee
constituted a transaction at an undervalue or constituted a preference, each as defined in the relevant
insolvency laws and in each case, where the action took place within a specified time period before
the insolvency of the relevant entity.

In France, among others, the granting of new security interests in the Collateral in connection with
Notes previously issued creates hardening period risk for such security interests, unless the nature and
base of the initial security interests is at least equivalent to that of the new ones. Certain arrangements
or disposals that are made during the “hardening period” (période suspecte) (a time period of a
maximum of eighteen months preceding the court decision commencing judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings and ending on the date of such court decision) may be challenged by the
receiver in bankruptcy and certain creditors under applicable rules of avoidance. The applicable
hardening period for these new security interests in the Collateral will run from the moment each new
security interest has been granted or perfected. The Indenture will permit the security interests in the
Collateral to be released and retaken in certain circumstances. Such release and retaking will restart
the applicable hardening periods. If any such security interest granted or recreated were sought to be
enforced before the end of the applicable hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective or it
may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—France—The “Hardening_
_Period” (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings.”_

In addition, in France, in the context of proceedings affecting creditors, including court-assisted
proceedings (mandat ad hoc proceedings or conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation)),
and court-administered proceedings (safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde or sauvegarde accélérée),
judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings
(liquidation judiciaire)), the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights under the Notes or
the Guarantees could be limited or suspended. Under French law, enforcement of a security interest in
the Collateral provided by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, may be adversely affected by
specific or general defenses available to debtors under French law, as the case may be, in respect of
the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such security interest.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency pursuant to various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may
be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or provided Collateral if (i) its liabilities
exceed the fair market value of its assets, (ii) it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due, or
(iii) the present value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become due. Although
we believe we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no
assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was
“insolvent” as of the date a Guarantee was issued or Collateral was provided, that a court would not
determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that payments to holders of the Notes
constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.


-----

Any insolvency proceedings with respect to any Guarantor incorporated in Denmark may proceed
under, and be governed by, the insolvency laws of Denmark. These laws may adversely affect the
enforcement of your rights under the Notes and may not be as favourable to your interests as a
creditor as the laws of other jurisdictions. Denmark is not a party to, and any insolvency proceedings
of any Guarantor incorporated in Denmark will consequently not be subject to, Regulation (EU)
2015/848 on insolvency proceedings (the EU Insolvency Regulation). In a Danish bankruptcy, the
debtor’s assets are liquidated, and the proceeds are distributed to the creditors based on a priority of
claims. Such liquidation may not yield the same value to the creditors as a reorganization and sale of a
going concern. As a general rule, the debtor or any creditor may present a petition for bankruptcy. A
bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court to be satisfied that the debtor is insolvent based on a
statement of the debtor’s liquidity status and that the insolvency is not of a purely temporary nature. A
bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately protected in the event of the
debtor’s insolvency by means of good and valid security. If bankruptcy proceedings are commenced,
payments under the Notes may be delayed and may not be made in full. Provisions on avoidance and
set off may adversely affect the enforcement of rights under the Notes.

For more information regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Issuer,
the Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at_**
**_which they may be sold._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws of the United States. The Notes have not been and will not be
registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, you may not transfer or sell
the Notes in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to,
the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to
an effective registration statement, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment in the
Notes for an indefinite period of time. The Notes and the Indenture will contain provisions that restrict
the Notes from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions
available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, or other exemptions under the Securities Act. In
addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on
behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes
in an aggregate principal amount of less than €100,000 for the Euro Notes and $200,000 for the Dollar
Notes. Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes under any other country’s securities laws and do
not have any intention to do so. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes
within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to
_Investors.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and will initially be held through
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and
Notes in definitive registered form (“Definitive Registered Notes”), will be issued in exchange for
Book-Entry Interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of Book-Entry Interests will not be
considered owners or holders of Notes. The Common Depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and
Clearstream and the custodian, or its nominee, for DTC will be the sole registered holder of the
Global Notes representing the Notes and will be entered as such in the register of holders of the Notes
maintained by the Registrar. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect
of the Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to the relevant Paying Agent, which then will
make payments to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. Thereafter, these payments will be
credited to participants’ accounts that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes representing the
Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, the Issuer, the Trustee, the relevant Paying Agent, the relevant Transfer Agent and the


-----

Registrar will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts
to the owners of Book-Entry Interests. Accordingly, if you own a Book-Entry Interest, you must rely
on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, and if you are not a participant in DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest,
to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the registered holders of the Notes themselves, owners of Book-Entry Interests will not have
the direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions
from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a Book-Entry Interest, you will be permitted to act only
to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream.
The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable you to
vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all Book-Entry Interests, if you own a Book-Entry Interest,
you will be restricted to acting through DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be
implemented through DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell your_**
**_Notes may be limited._**

There is no existing market for the Notes. We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

The Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes after
completing this Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the
Notes and may cease market-making at any time. In addition, changes in the overall market for high
yield securities and changes in our financial performance or in the markets where we operate may
adversely affect the liquidity of the trading market in these Notes and the market price quoted for
these Notes. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market will actually develop for
these Notes.

Historically, the markets for non-investment grade debt such as the Notes have been subject to
disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in their prices. Future trading prices for the Notes
will depend on many factors, including, among others, prevailing interest rates, our operating results
and the market for similar securities. The market, if any, for the Notes may be subject to similar
disruptions. Any disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes, regardless of our
prospects and financial performance. As a result, there can be no assurance that there will be an active
trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your
holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, no assurance can be given that the Notes will be listed on
the Official List of the Exchange or that such listing will be maintained. In addition, the Indenture will
allow the Issuer to issue additional Notes in the future, which could adversely impact the liquidity of
the Notes.

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries and effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure_**
**_the Notes._**


-----

Certain of our subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. Our subsidiaries will not have any obligation
to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee
the Notes or grant security interests in the Collateral in this respect. Generally, holders of debt of, and
trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are
entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made
available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound-up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

- the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be
entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before
the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, would be entitled to receive any
distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each related Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of and
for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Guarantors accounted for 72% of our total assets, 50% of
our consolidated revenues and 84% of our EBITDA. As of June 30, 2023, after giving effect to the
Transactions, subsidiaries of the Issuer not guaranteeing the Notes had €72.1 million of indebtedness
outstanding (excluding intercompany loans and lease liabilities). This amount will rank structurally
senior to the Notes and the related Guarantees. The Indenture, subject to certain limitations, will
permit these non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, which may also be secured.
If our non-guarantor subsidiaries’ indebtedness is secured on property or assets that do not form part
of the Collateral securing the Notes, the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the extent of the
value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness. See “Description of Other Indebtedness
_and Financing Arrangements.” Any of the debt that our non-guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future_
in accordance with the Indenture will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the related Guarantees,
and any debt we incur that is secured on property or assets that do not form part of the Collateral
securing the Notes will be effectively senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of the property or
assets securing such indebtedness.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of France, England and
Wales, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Australia, Germany and Italy, with their registered offices
or principal places of business in such countries. The directors, officers and other executives of the
Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are neither residents nor citizens of the United States.
Furthermore, most of the assets of the Issuer and certain assets of the Guarantors and their respective
directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for
investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them
judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state
securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of
process within France, England and Wales, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Australia, Germany and
Italy upon those persons or entities, provided that the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965, is
complied with (where applicable) or service is otherwise effected in accordance with the laws and
requirements of the jurisdiction of the relevant proceedings and of the jurisdiction in which service is
to be effected.

For example, the United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and
commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not


-----

directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered
could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal
_judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such U.S._
judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is
enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that certain conditions have
been met. For further information, see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_The Issuer may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer and, if_**
**_this occurs, the Issuer would be in default under the Indenture._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required to make an offer
to purchase all the outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
any accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
purchase. In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are
tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuer will
likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to
obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a
mandatory prepayment under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and agreements
governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any
failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default
under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers,
recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because
such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they
do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture. In addition, the occurrence of
certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed not to be a change
of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated net leverage ratio of the
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in
such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such
third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part,
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established_**
**_meaning under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain_**
**_that a change of control has occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, the
Issuer will be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered. The definition
of “change of control” in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any
person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it
has no clearly established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances
of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may
be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes.


-----

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies are expected to assign credit ratings to the Notes. The
credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit
risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings
may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or
more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost, terms and conditions of our
financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, any series of the
Notes receive a rating of “Baa3” or better from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or
“BBB-” or better from Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Services (“S&P”) and no default or event
of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time that
the Notes receive a rating below “Baa3” from Moody’s or “BBB-” from S&P, certain covenants will
cease to be applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension
_of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” If these covenants were to cease to be_
applicable, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness or make payments, including dividends
or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no
assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be
maintained.

**_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Exchange._**

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange. However, there can be no assurance that the Notes will become or
remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing
on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the
Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any
of the Notes on the Exchange does not imply that a public offering of any of the Notes in the Channel
Islands or Isle of Man has been authorized. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the
Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange
for comparable issuers, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official
List of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse effect on a holder’s ability to
resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes, which risks may be increased if the_**
**_euro no longer exists or if the Notes are otherwise redenominated as a result of Member States_**
**_leaving the eurozone._**

The Dollar Notes will be denominated and payable in U.S. dollars. The Euro Notes will be
denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a
currency other than euro or U.S. dollars, as applicable, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign
exchange-related risks due to, among others, possible significant changes in the value of the euro or
U.S. dollar, as applicable, relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return
on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.
Depreciation of the euro or U.S. dollar, as applicable, against the currency by reference to which
investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the


-----

Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their
investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. holders (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) may also have important tax consequences as a_
result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations.” Despite the measures taken by countries in the eurozone to_
alleviate credit risk, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their
ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the
euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual
eurozone Member States. These and other concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual
currencies in one or more Member States, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution
of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for
holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. We
cannot assure you that the official exchange rate at which the Notes may be redenominated would
accurately reflect their value in euro or U.S. dollars, as applicable. These potential developments, or
market perceptions concerning these developments and related issues, could adversely affect the value
of the Notes.

**_The grant of Collateral to secure the Notes might be challenged or voidable in an insolvency_**
**_proceeding._**

The grant of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent may be voidable by the grantor or by an
insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set
aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including,
among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits
the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency
proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified “claw-back” period
following the grant. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_The market value of the Notes could decrease if our creditworthiness worsens._**

The market value of the Notes will suffer if the market perceives us to be less likely to fully perform
all obligations under the Notes when they fall due, which could occur, for example, because of the
materialization of any of the risks listed herein regarding the Group. Even if the likelihood that we
will be in position to fully perform all of our obligations under the Notes when they fall due has not
actually decreased, market participants could have a different perception. In addition, the market
participants’ estimation of the creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or of debtors operating
in the same business as us could change adversely, causing the market value of the Notes to fall. If
any of these risks were to occur, third parties would only be willing to purchase Notes for a lower
price than before the materialization of these risks. Under these circumstances, the market value of the
Notes will decrease.


-----

###### USE OF PROCEEDS 

The aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be approximately €910.0 million
(equivalent), assuming an issuance at par. On the Issue Date, we intend to use the proceeds of the
Offering to (i) redeem the entire outstanding amount of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and (ii) pay
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the
Transactions. Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors,
including accrued interest on the debt being repaid and the actual date of repayment of such debt,
changes in our cash position on the actual Issue Date, fluctuations in currency exchange rates for
amounts not denominated in euro, differences from our estimates of fees, expenses and commissions
and any original issue discount. For descriptions of our current and anticipated indebtedness following
the offering of the Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom, see “Description of Other Indebtedness
_and Financing Arrangements” and “Capitalization.”_

_these forward-looking statements._

**Overview**

We are the world’s leading independent producer and distributor of content based on revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2022. We are also the world’s leading independent producer and distributor
of content in terms of hours of content as of June 30, 2023. We develop, produce and distribute
television formats and programs and digital content for a wide range of customers. We operate over
130 production companies across 21 countries and have a multi-genre catalogue boasting over
172,000 hours of content. We have produced successful, and at times, long-running scripted and nonscripted formats and programs, such as _Survivor, Temptation Island, Peaky Blinders, Big Brother,_
_MasterChef, Rogue Heroes, Hunted, Black Mirror, LEGO Masters, Deal or No Deal, Grantchester,_
_Don’t Forget The Lyrics!, Marie Antoinette, Fort Boyard, Versailles, Mr. Bean and_ _Good Karma_
_Hospital. Our broad brand portfolio and large creative platform position us to continue to nurture and_
drive new formats for broadcasters and digital platforms.

**Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

The following are key factors that have significantly affected our results of operations and financial
condition and liquidity or which we expect to significantly affect (or continue to affect) our results of
operations in the future.

**_Success of New Formats and New Programs_**

We produce both scripted and non-scripted content across all genres, including reality shows,
entertainment and talk shows, game shows and factual entertainment. Our creative talents are a key
element of our success and are constantly working to address customers’ demands or to anticipate
trends in the industry. We work with our customers to develop original formats that may become
long-running programs if they receive good ratings, making them a success. Periods in which we and
our customers have successfully anticipated trends produce more favorable results. Usually, a
successful program will run until viewers’ preferences change or until broadcasters or digital
platforms decide to replace the program, in which case they may ask us to develop a new format. If a
new program is successful, this will have a positive effect on the profitability of the local production
company that produced the program, since broadcasters and digital platforms will typically renew the
program for several seasons. In addition, it will have a positive impact on the Group’s revenues, since
a popular program in one country will often be successful in other countries with a similar audience,
either by the production in such country by one of our production companies or by licensing the
format to third-party production companies in the countries where we are not present. For the year
ended December 31, 2022, 43% of our production revenues were derived from content that has been
running for at least five consecutive seasons, 30% from content that has been running for two to five
consecutive seasons, and only 28% from new launches.

Non-scripted formats benefit from lower production costs, a shorter development period and more
advantageous financing arrangements, because the broadcasters and digital platforms who acquire
rights in non-scripted content fully fund production costs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our
production business generated 83% of our total revenues, of which non-scripted shows contributed


-----

80%. Our ability to accurately anticipate new trends and/or changes in consumer preferences and
needs, as well as focus our development efforts towards that goal, gives us the opportunity to
potentially create the next television blockbuster and, accordingly, will positively impact our
revenues. However, our revenues from broadcaster and digital platform sales will not be negatively
impacted if a new program is not successful, because the initial price for the sale of the program is not
determined based on its success. Different factors are taken into account when determining a
program’s price. The budget that the broadcasters and digital platforms wish to allocate for the
relevant time slot is a key element (since budgets are lower for day time slots than they are for access
prime-time or prime-time slots). The pricing also takes into account production costs based on the
type of program and the format fee payable for the format rights. The average format fee differs from
one country to another but, in our experience, is usually between 5% and 7% of the production
budget. In addition, the format fee will be higher if the format is successful and/or has already been
successfully aired in certain markets. The price of a program is also based on our bargaining power
with broadcasters and digital platforms. Even if a program is not successful in a specific market, we
will try to produce the format in another market where we are present or license it to another producer
in markets where we do not operate. We can also distribute the program through our distribution
subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited, and continue to derive distribution and secondary revenues from
that program.

**_Development of the Production of Scripted Programs_**

Scripted programs generally require a longer and more extensive development and production
process, leading to higher costs than non-scripted programs. Because of these higher production costs,
scripted programs also tend to generate lower margins than non-scripted programs, but they can
deliver higher revenues, particularly future secondary revenues when we manage to retain part of the
intellectual property rights and/or rights to secondary revenues. For the year ended December 31,
2022, non-scripted content generated €2,134 million, or 80%, of our production revenues, with the
remaining €531 million, or 20%, generated by scripted content, which we believe is generally the
appropriate mix for our operations. In the event that we seek to increase the proportion of our
revenues generated by scripted programs, we do not anticipate having to invest significantly as we
expect that third-party financing sources will largely incur the required upfront investment costs and
that we will benefit from our existing catalogue’s distribution revenues. The financing of scripted
programs requires financing commitments from broadcasters and co-producers, as well as from
distributors which may be our distribution subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited. We may therefore be
required to prefund development and/or production costs for a scripted program. The timing of the
upfront payments and final payments, as well as the participation of Banijay Rights Limited in the
financing of scripted programs, impact our working capital requirements. In addition, we rely on tax
credits in certain jurisdictions such as France, Italy, Spain or the United Kingdom, as part of the
financing of a scripted program. However, we may only be able to claim such tax credits after having
finalized the production of the program, which may require the Group to prefund a larger share of the
upfront production costs and capital expenditures.

Changes in working capital are impacted by the timing of production and program delivery and by the
production of scripted and non-scripted programs. Since non-scripted programs are mainly produced
in less than a year, working capital requirements related to our non-scripted business are mainly
impacted by fluctuations in the number of non-scripted programs we produce. We may record cut-off
impacts related to non-scripted activity at the end of each year if some large-scale programs are still
under production, because revenue is only recognized at the time of delivery of such program. On the
other hand, scripted productions have a longer production cycle, usually over two years, and higher
working capital requirements. Our working capital related to scripted activity can be impacted
significantly by cut-off issues at the end of the year. In addition, we sometimes finance a large part of
our scripted programs through tax credits or subsidies paid after the delivery of the program, which
has an impact on our working capital for the year during which we produce the program but have not
yet delivered it.


-----

**_Diversification of Our Customers_**

Our primary customers today are broadcasters and digital platforms. The number of broadcasters has
increased in recent years, which in turn has increased the number of customers available to purchase
our programs and therefore impacted our revenues. At the same time, broadcasters are facing
increasing competition from companies that deliver video content over the internet, commonly
referred to as over-the-top or “OTT programming.” With the growth of OTT programming, viewers’
video content consumption preferences may shift away from broadcasters and existing viewing habits.
In the United States and, to a lesser extent, Europe, consumers, and in particular younger
demographics, are viewing more content on more devices, with a shift towards mobile devices or
computers over televisions. As a result, many of our customers and potential customers are compelled
to find new original formats and programs to deliver content to viewers via the internet. We expect
this pressure to become even greater as digital platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video
continue to grow and penetrate new markets. We expect to benefit from this customer diversification
as we have historical relationships with many broadcasters and have already developed strong
commercial relationships with digital platforms. For the year ended December 31, 2022,
approximately 18% of our total revenues were generated from OTT players, an increase of
approximately 10% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect this diversification to
continue as OTT companies increasingly focus on non-scripted content, a genre in which we have
strong production know-how. In addition, we are increasingly focusing on formats or programs
which, once produced for a local market, can be sold or licensed internationally to customers in other
markets, such as broadcasters or digital platforms.

**_Distribution and Secondary Revenues_**

We have developed our business around two main sources of income: (i) sales of programs to
broadcasters and digital platforms and (ii) international distribution of our content through our
dedicated distribution subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited. We own intellectual property rights to a
broad and diversified portfolio of formats and programs representing over 172,000 hours of
audiovisual content. We distribute the content we own and license to a traditional customer base of
linear broadcasters and producers, as well as digital platforms. Our distribution business generates
revenues with high margins because we have limited costs in connection with managing our portfolio
of existing programs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our distribution and secondary business
generated revenues of €547 million, which represented 17% of our total revenues. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, our distribution business generated an Adjusted EBITDA of €99 million, which
represented 21% of our total Adjusted EBITDA. We intend to further develop our distribution
business and develop other sources of secondary revenues, such as revenues from advertising,
clipping, live entertainment or branded content. We expect this trend to have a positive impact on our
revenues, EBITDA and EBITDA margin.

**_Fluctuation in Our Revenues from Period to Period_**

We only recognize revenues from the sale of a program to a broadcaster or digital platform at the time
of the program’s delivery. This creates a mismatch between the revenues we actually receive in
connection with such sale and the revenues recognized in our financial statements. For example, we
occasionally receive production advances from broadcasters before production is complete and these
advances are not recognized in our revenues until the delivery of the program. As of June 30, 2023,
we had received production advances in the amount of €794 million relating to programs delivered or
to be delivered in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 or in 2024. In addition, as a result of the
broadcasting schedules of television networks and the fact that broadcasters typically premiere shows
in the second half of the calendar year, we generally report higher revenues in the fourth quarter of the
calendar year. Broadcasters can also decide to make changes to a program during the production
process, which may cause delays in the delivery of the program and therefore impact our revenues. In
addition, we offer our customers a period of time during which they can reject or return our programs
and until the expiration of this period, we may not be able to recognize the related revenues.


-----

Accordingly, our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period and the
results of one period may not be representative of the results of any future period.

**_Acquisitions and Joint Ventures_**

To grow our business, we continually assess our markets for opportunistic acquisitions of similar
businesses and assets, such as the acquisitions of and investments in Beyond in Australia in December
2022, A Fábrica in Brazil in March 2023, Twenty Two Productions in the Netherlands in March 2023
and our joint venture with LaLiga in Spain in June 2023. Most recently, in June 2023, we agreed to
acquire a controlling stake in Balich, an Italian live entertainment business in charge of creating,
producing and delivering live shows and experiences that engage live audiences worldwide, active in
20 countries. We generally focus on acquiring companies with specific creative talents, such as a
popular host or successful producer, and structure our acquisitions to incentivize such talents to
continue to work for us and to create further value. To that effect, we enter into various earn-outs or
put option agreements with certain of these talents, who are often the sellers of the targets. Payments
pursuant to earn-outs or put options are generally contingent and calculated based on the performance
of the acquired company over a specified time period following the acquisition. This period generally
corresponds to an exclusivity period during which the key managers and creative talents agree to work
exclusively for us. The key commercial points include the performance metrics underlying the
contingent payments, the earn-out or put option period (usually in an eight-year range), and the timing
and the structure of the contingent payment. We account for these earn-outs and put options as a
financial liability on our balance sheet rather than financial debt, because the amounts owed under
these incentive agreements vary depending on the performance of the business and because they do
not bear interest. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations and Contingent
_Liabilities.”_

If the opportunity arises, we may also decide to acquire companies in order to own the intellectual
property rights to their catalogue of formats and programs. For example, the completion of the
Endemol Shine Acquisition allowed us to expand our catalogue by approximately 65,000 hours,
amounting to a Group-level catalogue of approximately 110,000 hours, and we now own the
intellectual property rights to formats such as _Big Brother and_ _MasterChef, which are regarded as_
some of our most long-lasting and best travelling content. We may also acquire intellectual property
rights without acquiring a production company. For example, in December 2018, we acquired the
intellectual property rights to the Intervilles format and its derivatives (including _Jeux sans_
_frontières), which has been relaunched in Italy, Spain and Greece. We also establish joint ventures_
with popular local producers and talents to develop new production companies in certain markets. For
example, through our French joint venture Yasuke, which we established in 2022, we benefit from the
expertise of Teddy Riner, a three-time judo Olympic gold winner, to develop and produce formats
with a focus on the world of sport. If a joint venture is successful, we may acquire the remaining share
capital in the production company based on a pre-agreed price calculation formula. In the event that a
joint venture is not successful and incurs significant losses, we try to negotiate clauses in the related
agreement with the other party to limit any potential losses we may incur in connection with such
joint venture.

Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several ways. Our results for the period during which
an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired entity into our
consolidated results. The results of the acquired businesses after their acquisition may also be
positively affected by synergies. Additionally, we may experience an increase in operating expenses,
such as staff costs, as we integrate the acquired business into our Group. Finally, because acquired
entities are consolidated from their date of acquisition, the full impact of an acquisition or disposal is
only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period. Finally, because acquired
companies may only recognize revenues upon the delivery of the related production to a broadcaster
or digital platform, acquisitions we consummate may produce revenues in a subsequent quarter,
depending on the nature of the production, timing of delivery and other factors.


-----

**_General Economic Conditions in Our Markets_**

Macroeconomic factors in the geographic markets in which we operate affect our results of
operations. Broadcasters and digital platforms’ purchases of licenses for our formats and programs
have grown through various economic cycles because viewers continue to watch television and
demand new content throughout such cycles. However, broadcasters generate lower advertisement
revenues during economic downturns and therefore may try to reduce their budgets allocated to the
purchase or production of new programs. During these periods, broadcasters and digital platforms
become more risk averse and are reluctant to finance the production of untested, new programs to a
certain extent. We have been resilient to economic downturns in the past because we relied on
revenues from successful, long-running programs as well as the revenues generated by our
distribution business, but a new downturn may affect our future results of operations.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain its spread and
address its impact have had significant direct and indirect effects on businesses and commerce
generally, including disruptions to supply chain, workforce, international travel, transactional activity,
facility operation and production. As a result of some of the measures taken by governments in the
early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate its spread, we were unable to film any of our
programs in a number of countries in which we operate from March 2020 to May 2020, which
resulted in a significant number of production delays. Additionally, filming of certain programs was
also postponed after May 2020 as a result of travel restrictions and constraints in the casting of actors,
candidates and hosts for our formats and programs. Once filming and production resumed, we also
incurred additional production costs in order to ensure compliance with governmental guidelines
regarding social distancing, on-site testing, sanitation and hygiene. Although some of these costs were
covered by our customers, they were not included in our production fee calculations and therefore
decreased our margins. Although there was no meaningful impact on our business or financial
condition from the COVID-19 pandemic in the six months ended June 30, 2023, we cannot predict the
impact that any future developments relating to it may have on our business.

**_Growth in Our Key Markets_**

The size of the global television production market continues to grow but is experiencing a shift in
key revenue components. According to management consulting firm industry reports, the global
television industry was valued at approximately €451 billion of revenues in 2022, and is projected to
reach approximately €502 billion by 2027, growing at an anticipated CAGR of approximately 2.2%
during the period. According to Ampere, broadcasters’ and streamers’ global content reached
approximately €128 billion in 2013, and is projected to reach approximately €243 billion by the end
of 2023, growing at an anticipated CAGR of approximately 6.6% during the period. We expect
revenues growth in the television production market to continue to be influenced by viewership levels
and customers’ demand for new programs and formats in order to increase their viewership. Mobile
devices, including tablets, have accelerated the launch of digital platforms and the rise of social media
has increased audience engagement and contributed to new program development as video
consumption continues to increase in our key markets. We also expect customers’ demand for original
formats and programs in emerging markets to continue to be driven by a growing middle class. Our
revenues will be impacted from period to period by our ability to penetrate, and the continued growth
in, these emerging markets.

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Rates_**

Our reported results of operations and financial condition are affected by exchange rate fluctuations.
We are exposed to both transactional and translational risk due to these fluctuations. Transactional
risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than their functional
currency. We currently have production companies in 21 countries. As a result, we generate a
significant portion of our revenues and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other
than euro, our reporting currency. The primary currencies in which we generated revenues in the
twelve months ended June 30, 2023, were the euro, the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling. Where we


-----

are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, our
results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. For example, a stronger euro
will increase the cost of euro-denominated supplies for our non-euro businesses and conversely
decrease the cost of non-euro supplies for our euro businesses. Our subsidiaries generally execute
their sales to broadcasters and digital platforms and incur most of their materials costs in the same
currency. As a result, we currently do not seek to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations
through the use of derivative financial instruments, except in connection with a few local productions.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, 20.8% of our revenues were generated in U.S. dollars and
19.4% of our revenues was generated in GBP.

We also face translational currency exchange risk. We present our consolidated financial statements
in euro. As a result, we must translate the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of all of our
operations with a functional currency other than euro into euro at then-applicable exchange rates.
Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of these currencies against the euro may affect the
value of our assets, liabilities, income and expenses with respect to our non-euro businesses in our
consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency, which
creates translation risk. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results
between financial periods and result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets,
liabilities and shareholders’ equity. See “—Key Accounting Policies—Foreign Currency Translation.”

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements**

**_Changes to Accounting Standards and Policies_**

_2020 Restatement_

In the Audited Financial Statements, the consolidated statement of financial position as of December
31, 2020 and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the consolidated statement of cash flows and
the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in each case
derived from the prior-year comparative figures included in the Audited Financial Statements of
Banijay as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021) were restated to give retrospective effect to
a change in the accounting treatment for acquisition instruments with a lock-up mechanism. Pursuant
to such change, put options over minority interests in the context of a business combination that
include a lock-up mechanism are to be treated as remuneration of the employees or former owners of
the acquired entity for services rendered, rather than as consideration for the business combination.

The impact of this change in accounting policy was recognized retrospectively as of January 1, 2021,
resulting in (i) a €19 million loss in our consolidated statement of profit or loss, (ii) a €66 million
decrease in non-current assets, a €6 million increase in current assets, a €21 million decrease in
equity, a €35 million decrease in non-current liabilities and a €4 million decrease in current liabilities
in our consolidated statement of financial position, and (iii) a €12 million decrease in cash flows from
operating activities and a corresponding €12 million increase in cash flows from investing activities,
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, as applicable. For ease of comparison, we present
financial data reflecting this restatement when comparing information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2021 with information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. See note 5.4 to
the Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

**_Acquisitions_**

We have completed a number of selective acquisitions of varying sizes for the periods under review in
this offering memorandum, which impact the comparability of our financial results between periods.
Since we consolidate the results of operations of each acquired business in our financial statements
from the completion date of each acquisition, our historical financial periods are not directly
comparable to one another. Following the closing date of an acquisition, our results are consolidated
with the results of the acquired business, and are thereafter impacted by the revenues and expenses of
the acquired business. See “—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions and Joint
_Ventures.” As we continually assess our markets for opportunistic acquisitions of similar businesses_


-----

to grow our business, our financial statements in the future will vary from our historical consolidated
financial statements contained in this offering memorandum. Set forth below are brief descriptions of
certain of our significant acquisitions for the periods under review.

_Endemol Shine Acquisition_

In July 2020, we completed the Endemol Shine Acquisition, pursuant to which Banijay acquired the
entire share capital of Endemol Shine. As a result, Endemol Shine has been fully consolidated for the
purpose of the financial statements (including the balance sheet) of the Group for the year ended
December 31, 2020, apart from our income statement for the period, which reflects the Endemol
Shine Acquisition as of the completion date only. Therefore, our financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, do not fully
represent the results of operations and financial condition of the entire business and the comparability
of these financial statements with the financial statements of Banijay as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2022, presented in this offering memorandum is limited.

_Beyond_

In December 2022, we completed the acquisition of Beyond, pursuant to which we acquired the entire
share capital of this entity. Because the transaction was completed close to the end of the year ended
December 31, 2022, Beyond was not consolidated within the Group’s results for the period, and
consolidation instead began from January 2023. Therefore, our financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, do not fully
represent the results of operations and financial condition of the entire business and the comparability
of these financial statements with the financial statements of Banijay as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2021, presented in this offering memorandum is limited. Beyond generated
€65 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.

_Balich_

In June 2023, we agreed to acquire a controlling stake in Balich, an Italian live entertainment business
in charge of creating, producing and delivering live shows and experiences that engage live audiences
worldwide, active in 20 countries. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Balich
generated €315 million of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.

**Description of Key Income Statement Line Items**

Set forth below is a brief description of the composition of the key line items of our income statement.

**_Revenues_**

Revenues are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Group and the revenues can be reliably estimated. Revenues are measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, net of rebates, pay-backs, some specific grants, subsidies and coproducers’ contributions. We only recognize revenues from the sale of a program to a broadcaster or
digital platform at the time of the program’s delivery.

**_Operating Expenses_**

Operating expenses consist primarily of production costs, net of co-producers’ contributions, grants
and subsidies, consisting mainly of the costs of scripts, actors, directors, equipment rentals, technical
costs, participants, hosts, sets and format fees.

**_External Expenses_**

External expenses consist of advertising expenses, the employment costs of freelance workers,
outsourcing expenses, provisions and impairment losses on current assets and other expenses from
operations.


-----

**_Staff Costs_**

Staff costs consist of salaries and staff remuneration, including payroll expenses (including for
freelance production artists and technicians) and share-based payment expenses under IFRS 2 that
may be converted into cash on the realization of certain performance milestones: (i) expenses related
to share purchase or subscription plans; (ii) expenses related to plans allocating free shares; and (iii)
expenses related to exceptional bonus plans indexed to the increase in equity value. We also use the
services of a significant number of freelance production artists and technicians. This number varies
from time to time depending, in part, on the level of television production activity in which we are
engaged.

**_Taxes and Duties_**

Taxes and duties consist of taxes other than current income tax.

**_Depreciation and Amortization Expenses_**

Intangible and tangible assets are carried at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their
useful life. Scripted programs are amortized based on the revenues method. See “—Key Accounting
_Policies—Depreciation and Amortization.”_

**_Current Impairment Losses and Provisions, Net of Reversals_**

Current impairment losses and provisions, net of reversals, consist of impairment losses, provisions
and reversals. Provisions are recorded only if (i) the Group has a present payment obligation as a
result of a past events, (ii) it is likely that an expense will be required to settle such obligation and (iii)
a reliable estimate can be made as to the amount of such payment obligation. The charges relating to
provisions are accounted for as profit or loss, net of any contingent reimbursement. If the effect of the
time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a discount pre-tax rate that reflects,
where appropriate, the risks specific to that payment obligation. When discounting, the increase in the
provision due to the passage of time is recognized in finance costs.

**_Other Current and Non-current Operating Income and Expenses_**

Other current and non-current operating income and expenses consist of income and expenses that are
both unusual in nature and significant in terms of value at the Group-level. We present such income
and expenses separately in our income statement in order to facilitate the understanding of the
recurring operating performance of which such income and expenses are not part.

**_Finance Income_**

Finance income consists of income from long-term investments and loans, other interest and similar
income and gains.

**_Interest Expense_**

Interest expense consists primarily of interest on bank loans, bonds and shareholder loans and
expenses related to interest rate derivatives used to hedge the variable interest rates on our senior bank
debt.

**_Other Finance Income/(Costs)_**

Other finance income (costs) consists primarily of discounting costs and reevaluation costs related to
earn-outs and put option liabilities.

**_Income Tax_**

Income tax consists of current and deferred income tax.

(a) Change in value and percentage change represent the absolute difference and percentage difference, respectively, between the results
for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, based on the appropriate mathematical formula. Accordingly, decreases in cost
items are shown as positive changes in the change in value column, and negative changes in the percentage change (%) column, and
increases in cost items are shown as negative changes in the change in value column, and positive changes in the percentage change
(%) column.

(b) Our consolidated statement of profit or loss for the six months ended June 30, 2022 includes a €500 million reclassification of
external expenses and a €1 million reclassification of staff costs that were previously treated as operating expenses, in line with the
presentation of financial information of our indirect parent company, FLE. In addition, our consolidated statement of profit or loss for
the six months ended June 30, 2022, also includes a €4 million reclassification of other current operating expenses that was
previously treated as staff costs. The reclassifications are shown with retrospective effect in our Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements for the six months ended June 30, 2023, which include prior-year comparative figures for the six months ended June 30,
2022.

_Revenues_

Revenues increased by €30 million, or 2.1%, from €1,404 million for the six months ended June 30,
2022 to €1,434 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to (i)
the 1% growth of our production revenues during the period, thanks to the strong performance of our
top travelling formats, with Big Brother recording its 67[th] adaptation through a new version in Chile
and LEGO Masters recording its 21[st] adaptation through a new version in Japan, and (ii) the 15%


-----

growth of our distribution revenues during the period, thanks to the development of our intellectual
property rights as a result of our expanded catalogue of formats and programs.

_Operating Expenses, External Expenses and Staff Costs_

Operating expenses, external expenses and staff costs increased by €38 million, or 3.1%, from €1,241
million, or 88.4% of revenues, for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to €1,279 million, or 89.2% of
revenues, for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the growth of
our business in connection with the increase in production revenues described above. Such growth
resulted in higher external expenses (€677 million) related to marketing and rental costs, and was
partially offset by lower staff costs (€602 million) related to our long-term incentive plans for certain
key managers of the Group (see “Management—Remuneration and Other Benefits”) and government
grants and subsidies, mainly for the production of scripted programs (€66 million).

_Depreciation and Amortization Expenses_

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by €2 million, or 3.8%, from €53 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2022 to €55 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was
primarily due to the effect of the acquisition of Beyond in December 2022, which was only
consolidated into the Group’s results from January 2023.

_Current Impairment Losses And Provisions, Net of Reversals_

Current impairment losses and provisions, net of reversals decreased by €1 million, from €1 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to nil for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease
was primarily due to working capital reversals of provision (€1 million).

_Other Current Operating Income and Expenses_

Other current operating expenses increased by €1 million, or 25%, from €4 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2022 to €5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was
primarily due to higher management fees paid to LOV Group.

_Other Non-Current Operating Income (Expenses)_

Other non-current operating expenses increased by €7 million from nil for the six months ended June
30, 2022 to €7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to
restructuring costs (€3 million) and acquisition costs in relation to the purchase of production
companies, including A Fábrica, Twenty Two Productions and LaLiga (€4 million), partially offset by
the positive impact of changes in our consolidation scope resulting from our M&A activity (€1
million).

_Interest Expenses_

Interest expenses increased by €20 million, or 30.8%, from €65 million for the six months ended June
30, 2022 to €85 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to
the impact of the refinancing of our Senior Facilities in April 2023 and the cancellation of outstanding
issuance costs in connection therewith (€16 million) (see “Description of Other Indebtedness and
_Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement”), partially offset by the_
purchase by the Issuer of $55 million of the Existing Dollar Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a cash
tender offer in June 2023, as a result of which the principal amount of tendered Existing Dollar Senior
Secured Notes was cancelled.

_Other Finance Income (Costs)_

Other finance costs increased by €56 million from an income of €17 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2022 to costs of €39 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was
primarily due to (i) factoring commission in connection with interests paid on current account


-----

liabilities, (ii) discounting expenses related to our earn-out and put option liabilities (€5.3 million) and
(iii) losses on foreign exchange hedging instruments used for some of our third-party indebtedness
(€6.4 million).

_Income Tax_

Income tax decreased by €22 million from an expense of €16 million for the six months ended June
30, 2022 to an income of €6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was
primarily due to the increase in revenues described above and the higher effective income tax rate
during the period.

_Profit (Loss) for the Period_

Profit for the period decreased by €72 million, from a profit of €41 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2022 to a loss of €31 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was
primarily due to the reasons stated above.

__________

(a) Change in value and percentage change represent the absolute difference and percentage difference, respectively, between the results
for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, based on the appropriate mathematical formula. Accordingly, decreases in cost
items are shown as positive changes in the change in value column, and negative changes in the percentage change (%) column, and
increases in cost items are shown as negative changes in the change in value column, and positive changes in the percentage change
(%) column.

(b) Our consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a €13 million reclassification of operating
expenses that was previously treated as external expenses. The reclassification was made in order to accurately relocate expenses that
are directly attributable to our revenues, and is shown with retrospective effect in our Audited Financial Statements for the year ended
December 31, 2022, which include prior-year comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Revenues_

Revenues increased by €456 million, or 16.5%, from €2,756 million for the year ended December 31,
2021 to €3,212 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due the
18% growth of our production revenues during the period, thanks to successful production cycles in
the United Kingdom, the U.S. and the Latin American regions, with a mix of returning established
programs and the development of new original programs such as Pride and Prejudice, Lizzo, Rogue
_Heroes and Good Karma Hospital. Our distribution revenues grew by 17% during the period, thanks_
to additional engagement with OTT players and new scripted shows generating more finished tapes
sales such as Rogue Heroes, Marie-Antoinette, Riches and the new season of Peaky Blinders.

_Operating Expenses, External Expenses and Staff Costs_


-----

Operating expenses, external expenses and staff costs increased by €427 million, or 17.9%, from
€2,380 million, or 86.4% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €2,807 million, or
87.4% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the
growth of our business in connection with the increase in production revenues described above. Such
growth resulted in higher operating expenses (€1,257 million) related to production and administrative
costs, external expenses (€247 million) related to marketing and rental costs, and staff costs (€1,303
million) related to our long-term incentive plans for certain key managers of the Group. The increase
was partially offset by government grants and subsidies for the production of scripted programs
(€95.4 million).

_Depreciation and Amortization Expenses_

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by €12 million, or 9.7%, from €124 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 to €136 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase
was primarily due to (i) the recoupment of distribution advances to third parties based on sales
volume, and (ii) the continued development of our scripted business, which led to higher depreciation
of our production costs.

_Current Impairment Losses And Provisions, Net of Reversals_

Current impairment losses and provisions, net of reversals decreased by €5 million, or 71.4%, from €7
million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
This decrease was primarily due to the normalization of our impairment losses during the period
following the incurrence of a €5 million distribution advance impairment during the year ended
December 31, 2021.

_Other Current Operating Income and Expenses_

Other current operating expenses remained stable at €1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

_Other Non-Current Operating Income (Expenses)_

Other non-current operating expenses increased by €4 million, or 15.4%, from €26 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 to €30 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase
was primarily due to restructuring costs (€11 million), acquisition costs in relation to the purchase of
production companies, including Montmartre Films, Znak TV, Grøenlandia and Movimenti (€3
million), changes in our consolidation scope resulting from our M&A activity (€8 million) and
litigation costs incurred during the period (€4 million).

_Interest Expenses_

Interest expenses increased by €7 million, or 5.6%, from €125 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to €132 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to
the negative variation of the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate during the period, and the impact
thereof on our U.S. dollar-denominated indebtedness.

_Other Finance Income (Costs)_

Other finance costs increased by €11 million, from an income of €4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to costs of €7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase in
costs was primarily due to the discounting and revaluation expenses of our earn-out and put option
liabilities (€18 million), and was partially offset by gains on foreign exchange hedging instruments
used for some of our third-party indebtedness (€8 million).

_Income Tax_


-----

Income tax increased by €14 million, or 53.8%, from €26 million for the year ended December 31,
2021 to €40 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to
additional business contributions and the impact of deferred tax losses in France and Italy as a result
of unfavorable tax planning.

_Profit (Loss) for the Period_

Profit for the year decreased by €14 million, or 20.6%, from €68 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to €54 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the
reasons stated above.

(c) Our consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a €13 million reclassification of operating
expenses that was previously treated as external expenses. The reclassification was made in order to accurately relocate expenses that
are directly attributable to our revenues, and is shown with retrospective effect in our Audited Financial Statements for the year ended
December 31, 2022, which include prior-year comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Revenues_

Revenues increased by €1,160 million, or 72.7%, from €1,596 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 to €2,756 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due (i)
a change in scope of consolidation, which had a positive impact of €747 million, following, among
others, the completion of the Endemol Shine Acquisition, (ii) the organic growth of our business
(€150 million), (iii) seasonality during the period as a result of the postponement of projects from


-----

2020 to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic (€198 million), (iv) secondary revenues from our
intellectual property rights (€37 million), (v) a change in scope of consolidation following bolt-on
acquisitions during the period (€17 million), and (vi) exchange rate variations (€11 million).

_Operating Expenses, External Expenses and Staff Costs_

Operating expenses, external expenses and staff costs increased by €1,010 million, or 73.7%, from
€1,370 million, or 85.8% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €2,380 million, or
86.4% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due the
growth of our business in connection with the increase in revenues described above. Such growth
resulted in higher operating expenses (€1,069 million) related to production and administrative costs,
external expenses (€212 million) related to marketing and rental costs, and staff costs (€1,099 million)
related to our higher headcount following the Endemol Shine Acquisition and long-term incentive
plans for certain key managers of the Group.

_Depreciation and Amortization Expenses_

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by €54 million, or 77.1%, from €70 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 to €124 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase
was primarily due to the impact of the Endemol Shine Acquisition (€30 million) and to the continued
development of our scripted business, which led to higher depreciation of our production costs.

_Current Impairment Losses And Provisions, Net of Reversals_

Current impairment losses and provisions, net of reversals decreased by €9 million, from a provision
of €2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to losses of €7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a distribution advance impairment (€5
million) incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Other Current Operating Income and Expenses_

Other current operating expenses increased by €3 million, from an income of €2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 to an expense of €1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This
increase was primarily due to government grants paid during the year ended December 31, 2020
which were not renewed during the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Other Non-Current Operating Income (Expenses)_

Other non-current operating expenses decreased by €26 million, or 50.0%, from €52 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 to €26 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease
was primarily due to lower restructuring costs during the period following the integration of Endemol
into the Group, lower acquisition costs and the impact of capital gain on investment in associates (€8
million).

_Interest Expenses_

Interest expenses increased by €13 million, or 11.6%, from €112 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 to €125 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to
the full-year impact of interest payments in connection with the financing of the Endemol Shine
Acquisition, including the Existing Notes and the Senior Facilities.

_Other Finance Income (Costs)_

Other finance income decreased by €35 million, or 89.7%, from €39 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 to €4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily
due to negative variation in foreign exchange rates and the impact thereof on our U.S. dollardenominated indebtedness.

_Income Tax_


-----

Income tax increased by €11 million, or 73.3%, from €15 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 to €26 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to
additional business contributions and the impact of deferred tax losses in the Netherlands, the United
Kingdom and Australia.

_Profit (Loss) for the Period_

Profit for the year increased by €49 million, from €19 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
to €68 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the reasons
stated above.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Liquidity describes, notably, the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flow to meet the cash
requirements of its business operations, including, but not limited to, working capital needs, capital
expenditures, debt service obligations, contractual obligations and acquisitions.

Our principal sources of liquidity on an ongoing basis have been and, following the completion of the
Transactions are expected to continue to be, our generation of cash flow from operations, drawings
under the Revolving Credit Facility, non-recourse factoring agreements, production financings and
other corporate liquidity resources. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily to fund acquisitions,
meet our debt service obligations, fund our working capital needs and, to a lesser extent, fund capital
expenditures.

Our ability to generate sufficient cash for our ongoing operations depends on our operating
performance, which in turn depends, to some extent, on general economic, financial, industry,
regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed
in “Risk Factors.” We believe that, based on our current level of operations as reflected in our results
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, our cash flow from operating activities, cash on
hand and the availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund
our operations, capital expenditures and debt service for at least the next twelve months. However, we
cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet such
financing needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient
to meet our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes, the Senior Facilities or on our
other debt when due. If our cash flow from operating activities are lower than expected, we may be
required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms
to us, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depend on numerous
factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial
institutions and capital markets, restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and our general financial
performance.

In April 2023, we successfully refinanced our indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, pursuant to which the EUR Term Loan B1 and the USD Term Loan B1 were made
available and drawn in full. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—
_Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.” On the Issue Date, we will have access to funds under_
the Revolving Credit Facility, the availability of which is subject to certain conditions, in an amount
of €170.0 million (equivalent), of which €20.0 million was drawn in August 2023. We anticipate that
we will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our high leverage may have important
negative consequences for you. See “Risk Factors.” There are also limitations on our ability to obtain
additional debt or equity financing. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing
_Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” In addition, any additional indebtedness that we do_
incur could reduce the amount of our cash flow available to make payments on our then existing
indebtedness, including under the Notes offered hereby, and increase our leverage. We may from time
to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open market
purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on
market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.

**_Cash Flow_**

The following cash flow information is extracted from historical consolidated financial statements of
Banijay on a stand-alone basis. The table below sets forth certain line items from the Group’s cash
flow statement for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, as well as the six months
ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

______________

(a) During the year ended December 31, 2021, we restated our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31,
2020 derived from the prior-year comparative figures, which restated figures were included in the Audited Financial Statements of
Banijay for the year ended December 31, 2021. See “—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—
_Changes to Accounting Standards and Policies—2020 Restatement” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—2020_
_Restatement.”_

**_Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities_**

Net cash flow from operating activities decreased by €5 million, or 4.9%, from a cash inflow of €102
million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, to a cash inflow of €97 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the higher number of shows which were still
being produced but had not yet delivered during the period.

Net cash flow from operating activities increased by €53 million, or 16.2%, from a cash inflow of
€327 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to a cash inflow of €380 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the positive effect of the organic
growth of our business and change in working capital driven by the normalization of our production
activities after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Net cash flow from operating activities increased by €103 million, or 46.0%, from a cash inflow of
€224 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to a cash inflow of €327 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to change in working capital driven by a
high level of external financing in connection with our production of scripted content during the
period.

**_Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities_**

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased by €8 million, or 21.6%, from an outflow of €37
million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, to an outflow of €45 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to (i) higher investments in connection with the
improvement of our production studio facilities in Brazil, and (ii) an increase in financial assets in
connection with investments in our joint ventures. The increase was partially offset by a lower M&A
activity during the period.

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased by €90 million, from a cash outflow of €82
million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to a cash outflow of €172 million for the year ended


-----

December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a short-term loan to Betclic (€32 million)
and (ii) consideration paid for the acquisition of Beyond (€30 million).

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased by €1,805 million, or 95.7%, from a cash outflow
of €1,887 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to a cash outflow of €82 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the consideration paid for the Endemol
Shine Acquisition in 2020.

**_Net Cash Flow from (used in) Financing Activities_**

Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased by €47 million, or 58.8%, from an outflow of €80
million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, to an outflow of €33 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to higher proceeds from borrowings and other
financial liabilities resulting from the refinancing of the Senior Facilities in April 2023. This decrease
was partially offset by (i) the purchase by the Issuer of $55 million of the Existing Dollar Senior
Secured Notes pursuant to a cash tender offer in June 2023, as a result of which the principal amount
of tendered Existing Dollar Senior Secured Notes was cancelled, and (ii) dividend payments during
the period.

Net cash flow used in financing activities increased by €4 million, or 2.4%, from a cash outflow of
€169 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to a cash outflow of €173 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher interest expenses on our
indebtedness as a result of interest rate hikes during the period and the impact thereof on our senior
bank debt that bears interest at floating interest rates. Net cash flow used in financing activities for the
year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to (i) the repayment of our third-party indebtedness
(€117 million) and (ii) the repayment of lease liabilities (€39 million).

Net cash flow from financing activities decreased by €2,014 million, from a cash inflow of €1,845
million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to a cash outflow of €169 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the normalization of our financing activities
following the refinancing of our indebtedness in connection with the Endemol Shine Acquisition
through the issuance of the Existing Notes and the Senior Facilities in 2020.

**_Working Capital_**

We define “working capital” as the sum of inventories, trade and other receivables and other current
assets, less trade and other payable and other current liabilities. The following table provides an
overview of our working capital as of December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020, and June 30, 2023, based on
the Financial Statements.


**As of**

**December 31,**


**As of**

**June 30,**


**(in € millions)** **2022** **2021** **2020** **2023**

Inventories .................................................................................. 705 677 427 819

Customer contract liabilities ....................................................... — — — (794)

Trade and other receivables ........................................................ 726 657 577 480

**Working capital[(1)] .....................................................................** **(77)** **(135)** **(145)** **(159)**

____________

(1) The difference between total working capital does not correspond to the changes in working capital presented in our cash flow
statement due to (i) the current portion of earn-outs and put option liabilities included in the above working capital, (ii) certain items
included in the change in working capital in our cash flow statement but not our balance sheet and (iii) non-cash items having an
impact on working capital for the period, such as change in consolidation scope and foreign exchange impact.


-----

Changes in working capital are impacted by the timing of production and program delivery and by the
production of scripted and non-scripted programs. Since non-scripted programs are mainly produced
in less than a year, working capital requirements related to our non-scripted business are mainly
impacted by fluctuations in the number of non-scripted programs we produce. We may record cut-off
impacts related to non-scripted activity at the end of each year if some large-scale programs are still
under production, because revenue is only recognized at the time of delivery of such program. On the
other hand, scripted productions have a longer production cycle, usually over two years, and higher
working capital requirements. During the periods under review, we have expanded our scripted
activity to meet our customers’ and the market’s increasing demand for scripted content. For the year
ended December 31, 2022, 20% of our production revenues were generated by scripted content, which
we believe is generally the appropriate mix for our operations. Our working capital related to scripted
activity can be impacted significantly by cut-off issues at the end of the year. In addition, we
sometimes finance a large part of our scripted programs through tax credits or subsidies paid after the
delivery of the program, which has an impact on our working capital for the year during which we
produce the program but have not yet delivered it.

**_Taxation and Tax Assets_**

Our total income tax paid for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to €40 million
and €26 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was
48.7%. Deferred tax assets have been recognized against deferred tax liabilities or future reasonable
taxable profits over the next two years.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

To support our business strategy and development plans and to further expand our business, we
regularly incur capital expenditures. The following table sets forth the amount of capital expenditure
incurred during the periods presented:


**For the year ended**

**December 31,**


**For the six months ended June**

**30,**


**(in € millions)** **2022** **2021** **2020** **2023** **2022**

Scripted production costs .................................................. — — (4) — —

Intellectual property rights ................................................ (37) (39) (14) (11) (14)

**Total .................................................................................** **(60)** **(56)** **(32)** **(27)** **(25)**

Capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2023 amounted to €27 million, compared to
€24 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase was mainly related to IT
investments and building and leaseholds improvements. Our capital expenditures for the six months
ended June 30, 2023 consisted primarily of (i) intellectual property rights of €11 million and (ii)
investments in technical equipment of €16 million.

Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to €60 million, compared to €56
million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was mainly related to IT investments
and building and leaseholds improvements. Our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31,
2022 consisted of (i) investments in intellectual property rights of €37 million and (ii) investments in
technical equipment of €23 million.

Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to €56 million, compared to
€32 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was mainly related to investments
into intellectual property rights of formats and programs by Banijay Rights Limited. Our capital
expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of (i) investments in intellectual
property rights of €39 million and (ii) investments in technical equipment of €17 million.


-----

Our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of (i) production costs for
scripted programs of €4 million, (ii) investments in intellectual property rights of €14 million and (iii)
investments in technical equipment of €14 million.

For the year ending December 31, 2023, we expect to incur capital expenditures in the amount of
approximately €63 million, consisting primarily of investments in intellectual property rights and
investments in technical equipment. We plan to fund our future capital expenditures with cash from
operating activities.

**_Cash Pooling Arrangements_**

We have implemented an automated cash pool for our subsidiaries. The master account holders are
Banijay and the Issuer and all other members are connected via their local banks to the cash pool.
Local positive bank balances are transferred automatically to the master account holders at the end of
each bank working day and bank balances at local banks are automatically balanced by the master
account holders at the end of the bank working day. As needed, we also have other credit lines,
including under the Revolving Credit Facility, available for utilization.

**_Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities_**

The information presented in the table below reflects our estimates of the contractual maturities of our
obligations. These maturities may differ significantly from the actual maturity of these obligations.
The table below also mainly reflects those agreements and obligations that are customary and
necessary in light of the activities in which we are engaged. We believe that our cash generated from
operating activities and amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to
satisfy present working capital requirements.

(1) Represents the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby.

(2) Represents the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Existing Senior Notes as of June 30, 2023, excluding estimated
accrued and unpaid interest.

(3) Represents the principal amount outstanding under our Senior Facilities (comprising the EUR Term Loan B1, the USD Term Loan
B1 and the Revolving Credit Facility). See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured
_Credit Facilities Agreement.”_

(4) Represents existing third-party borrowings which consist of various credit facilities (including recourse factoring or assignment of
receivables or future receivables) to finance the development, production and operation of our programs and audiovisual or digital
content. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Other Financing Arrangements.”

(5) Represents amounts payable under leases that are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16.

(6) Represents cash payments due under liabilities for earn-outs and put option liabilities. In connection with the acquisition of
companies in various jurisdictions, we have entered into, and will continue to enter into, earn-outs or put option agreements with
certain key managers and creative talents of these companies, when they are the sellers of such companies, to incentivize them to
continue to work with us following the relevant acquisition. See “—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions and
_Joint Ventures.”_

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We are party to various customary off balance sheet arrangements. See note 5.10 to the Audited
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 and note 20 to the Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements, in each case included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk**

Market risk represents the risk that our income and expenses, future cash flow or fair value of
financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises
currency risk, interest rates risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Our financial policy is aimed at
minimizing the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates on our results in the
short-term and following market rates in the long term.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

Because of the international nature of our operations, we are exposed to currency risks with respect to
various currencies. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flow of a
financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our exposure to the
risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to our operating activities (when revenues
or expense are denominated in a different currency from our presentation currency).


-----

In addition, operating companies may, under strict conditions, opt for hedging currency risks from
firm commitments and forecasted transactions. The currencies giving rise to these risks are primarily
the euro, the U.S. dollar and pound sterling. As of December 31, 2022, 20.8% of our revenues were
generated in U.S. dollars. A decrease of 5% or an increase of 5% of the U.S. dollars foreign exchange
rate would have an impact on our consolidated revenues of €(32) million and €35 million,
respectively, and an impact on our consolidated equity of €25 million and €(28) million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, 19.4% of our revenues were generated in GBP. A decrease of 5% or an
increase of 5% of the GBP foreign exchange rate would have an impact on our consolidated revenues
of €(30) million and €33 million, respectively, and an impact on our consolidated equity of €5 million
and €(6) million, respectively. The risks arising from currency exposures are regularly reviewed and
hedged when appropriate. We use flexible forward contracts to hedge the exposure to fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates.

Furthermore, we also face currency risk due to the translation of the functional currency of certain of
our divisions, which differs from our reporting currency. Translational exposure does not give rise to
an immediate cash expense or income, but we nevertheless closely monitor our translational exposure.

**_Interest Rate Risks_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flow of financial instruments will
fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Our interest rate risk policy is aimed at
minimizing the interest rate risks associated with our financing and thus at the same time optimizing
the net interest costs. This policy translates into a certain desired profile of fixed-interest and floatinginterest positions, including cash and cash equivalents. We use interest rate derivatives to hedge the
variable interest rates on our senior bank debt.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk represents the accounting loss if one of our counterparties fails to perform in accordance
with the terms of our agreements. Credit risk is related to financial instruments such as cash and cash
equivalents, receivables and derivative financial instruments. As part of our risk management, we
evaluate the credit of potential counterparties to derivative financial transactions or cash transactions
before we agree to enter into a commercial relationship. We manage our credit risk according to
policies, procedures and controls determined by us regarding the credit risk management of our
customers. We are exposed to credit risk from our operating activities (primarily for trade receivables)
and from our financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign
exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

We do not believe that we have a significantly concentrated exposure to credit risk because we have a
large number of customers and for the year ended December 31, 2022, our top eight broadcasters
accounted for 43% of our production revenues, and no single broadcaster accounted for more than
12% of our production revenues. In order to reduce our credit risk, our operating companies purchase
credit insurance where appropriate, and in some cases, demand parent company guarantees or other
security interests. To further mitigate our credit risk, our operating companies may sell part of their
receivables on a non-recourse basis. We periodically analyze the balances of each major customer in
order to determine the need for provisions or impairment.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

In addition to the management of currency, interest rate and credit risks, liquidity management
represents a key element of our financial management. Liquidity risk arises from our potential
inability to meet our financial obligations to our suppliers and financing providers. The goal of
liquidity management is to secure our ability to service our commitments and to make payments when
required. Our liquidity situation is closely monitored and rolling forecasts of cash flow and cash
holdings are prepared regularly.


-----

We operate several legal entities in several countries. To address the liquidity risk, we have put in
place cash pooling agreements in Europe, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Nordic
Countries, which covered 86% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. See “—
_Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash Pooling Arrangements.” We also monitor with high_
frequency our cash balances and cash forecasts. When required, additional debt or equity-based
money transfers between our entities are implemented. We also manage financial liabilities and
related derivative contracts on the basis of the remaining contractual maturities of these instruments.

**Key Accounting Policies**

The following are certain of the key accounting policies applied by us in preparing our consolidated
financial statements.

**_Business Combinations and Goodwill_**

Business combinations are accounted using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured on the acquisition date, at fair
value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the target. For each business combination, the
acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the target either at fair value or at the proportionate
share of the target’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.

When we acquire a business, we assess the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate
classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and
pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in
host contracts by the target.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s
previously held equity interest in the target is remeasured to fair value as of the acquisition date
through profit and loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be
recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent
consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognized either in profit or loss or
as change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it
will not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over our net
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of
the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized in profit or loss. After initial
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date,
allocated to each of our CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of
whether other assets or liabilities of the target are assigned to those units.

Where goodwill forms part of a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the
goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation
when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this
circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of
the CGU retained.

**_Foreign Currency Translation_**

Our presentation currency is the euro. Each entity of the Group records transactions and items in the
statement of financial position in its functional currency. Transactions denominated in a currency
other than the functional currency are recorded at the spot exchange rates prevailing on the date of the
transactions.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the
entity are translated at the closing rates. Exchange differences resulting from the settlement of these
transactions and from the translation of monetary items are recognized in the income statement.


-----

Non-monetary assets denominated in a currency other than the functional currency continue to be
translated against the rate at initial recognition and will not result in exchange differences. On
combination, the statement of financial position of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
euro are translated into euro at the closing rate. The consolidated statements of comprehensive income
of these entities are translated into euro at the average rates for the relevant period.

Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in entities with a functional
currency other than the euro are recorded through other comprehensive income in the translation
reserve. The same applies to exchange differences arising from borrowings and other financial
instruments in so far as they hedge the currency risk related to the net investment. On disposal of an
entity with a functional currency other than the euro, the cumulative exchange differences relating to
the translation of the net investment are recognized in the income statement.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Revenues are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Group and the revenues can be reliably estimated. Revenues are measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, net of rebates, pay-backs, grants, subsidies and co-producers’
contributions. Revenues are either recognized at the “point in time” when the performance obligation
in the contract has been performed, or “over time” as control of the performance obligation is
transferred to the counterparty.

**_Production Revenues (From Producing Television Programs)_**

Production revenues are recognized when programs are delivered to the customer. Standard criteria to
establish revenue recognition are:

- usually, a customer’s acknowledgement of receipt (such as a delivery notice signed or approved
by the customer);

- the delivery of a certain number of programs or episodes thereof; or

- the expiration of the period stated in the contract to reject or return the program.

In the event of the partial delivery of the same program over several periods of time (such as for a
series), revenues, costs and margins are recognized according to the time of such partial deliveries.
Production revenues are booked net of grants, subsidies and co-producers’ contributions.

**_Distribution Revenues (From the Sale of Programs)_**

Distribution revenues are recognized when the rights are transferred to the customer:

- on the basis of a signed contract or a deal memo;

- when the related rights are opened; and

- for the full revenues (revenues are not spread over the licensing period), as it is an access to
right.

**_Revenues from Other Rights and Services_**

Other rights and services include merchandising, music rights, other ancillary revenues and digital
services. Merchandising revenues are recognized when the rights are transferred to the customer:

- on the basis of a signed contract or a deal memo;

- when the licensing period begins; and

- for the full revenues (revenues are not spread over the licensing period).


-----

Minimum guarantees are recognized as revenues when the above criteria are met. Further payments
are recognized as revenues when received.

Revenues from music rights are recognized as revenues when received. Revenues and costs related to
the rendering of services are recognized on completion of the service rendered as long as they can be
estimated reliably. A service can be considered delivered when the milestones specified in the
contract have been reached. However, if the contract specifies and schedules several completion
milestones, then revenues and costs can be recognized partially according to the defined completion
milestones. For practical reasons, when services are performed by an undetermined series of actions
over a specified period of time, revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the specified
period, unless there is some evidence that some other method better represents the stage of completion
(as described above).

When the outcome of the transaction cannot be estimated reliably, revenues shall be recognized only
to the extent of the expenses recognized.

**_Commissions_**

When we act as an agent rather than as a principal in a transaction, the revenues recognized is the net
amount of commission earned by us.

**_Grants and Subsidies_**

Grants and subsidies are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received
and all attached conditions will be fully complied with.

Grants and subsidies that are strictly related to the financing of a given program are deducted from
production costs. When they relate to an asset, grants and subsidies are directly deducted from the
carrying amount of the asset and released to the amortization and depreciation calculated on the net
amount over the useful life of the asset.

All other grants and subsidies, such as government grants or income tax credits such as the _Crédit_
_d’impôt cinéma in France, are recognized as “Other operating income” when granted._

**_Distinction Between Current and Non-Current_**

An asset (liability) is classified as current when it is expected to be realized (settled) within twelve
months after the end of the reporting period, with the exception of deferred taxes which are shown as
non-current assets and liabilities.

**_Impairment of Assets_**

When there are indications that the carrying amount of a non-current asset (whether intangible or
tangible asset) may exceed the estimated recoverable amount (the higher between its value in use and
its fair value less costs to sell), the possible existence of an impairment loss is investigated. If an asset
does not generate sufficient independent cash flow, the recoverable amount is determined for the
CGUs to which the asset belongs. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market interest rates
and the risks specific to the asset.

All financial assets are reviewed for impairment. If there is objective evidence of impairment as a
result of one or more events after initial recognition, an impairment loss is recognized in the income
statement. The annual impairment tests are performed at year end. The recoverable amount of the
CGUs concerned is based on a value-in-use calculation. The model is based on a four-year forecast of
discounted cash flows, plus a terminal value. The net discounted cash flows are calculated before tax.
Intangible assets are recorded at cost. As for audiovisual rights, they are depreciated on an accelerated
basis following the decline in the net value of the asset following its initial broadcast. Other intangible
and tangible assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets. The


-----

Group’s management uses its experience to estimate the remaining useful life and residual value of an
asset.

When the recoverable amount of a non-current asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount is impaired to its recoverable amount and an impairment charge is recognized in the income
statement. An impairment loss is reversed when there has been a change in estimate that is relevant
for the determination of the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.

**_Intangible Assets_**

Intangible assets include:

- format rights acquired from a third party or through business combinations;

- our portfolio of programs, whether acquired or internally developed, for which we have the legal
right to distribute and to receive revenues from the distribution of these programs;

- production contracts or customer contracts, acquired through business combinations, for the
production of television programs;

- costs incurred for scripted productions, for which the group retains the intellectual property and
expects material revenue, that are not yet finalized and have not been delivered to the customer;
and

- other intangible assets, such as rights to the film adaptation of books or software.


_Initial Recognition_

The initial recognition of intangible assets is at cost, except for those acquired in a business
combination, which are recognized at fair value.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation
and any accumulated impairment losses. Audiovisual rights are considered to have a definite useful
life. Intangible assets should be depreciated based on the consumption of the associated economic
benefits and on the remaining useful life of the asset. Therefore, audiovisual rights are depreciated on
an accelerated basis following the decline in the net value of the asset after its initial broadcast.

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are depreciated as follows:

- _catalogue: on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period; and_

- _customer contracts: on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contract._

The depreciation period and the amortization method are reviewed at least once per year, generally at
the end of the financial year. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected projections of
economic benefits of the asset are accounted for by changing the depreciation period or method, as
appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at their acquisition cost, less accumulated depreciation
and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of such
fixed assets. The residual value, the useful life and depreciation methods of the fixed assets are
reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, at the end of each financial year.


-----

**_Leases_**

Leases are recognized by the lessee as an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and as a financial
liability for lease payments. At the inception of a lease contract, a lease liability is recognized to make
lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. Lease
liabilities are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Rightof-use of leases are amortized over the lease’s duration. In the income statement, depreciation and
amortization is recognized as the counterpart of the asset amortization and financial interest is
recognized as the counterpart of the finance lease discounting effect. In the cash flow statement
presentation, actual lease payments are classified as payments of lease liability within financing
activities.

The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases that are not booked as an asset or a financial
liability, which are booked as external expenses in the income statement and their related cash flows
are classified in cash generated from operating activities.

**Significant Accounting Judgments, Estimates and Assumptions**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets
and liabilities, the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty
about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to
the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.

**_Judgments_**

In the process of applying our accounting policies, our management has made the following
judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in our consolidated
financial statements.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Revenues from the sale of goods is recognized when the group has substantially transferred the
control over the goods sold to the customer.

**_Deferred Tax Assets_**

Deferred tax assets related to compensating tax losses are recognized as long as it is probable that we
will generate enough profit for tax purposes in order to set off these deferred tax assets. In order to
determine the value of the deferred tax assets arising from tax losses compensating, significant
management judgment is required regarding the probable timing and level of the future taxable
profits, combined with future fiscal planning strategies.

**_Estimates and Assumptions_**

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimates that have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of revenues, costs, assets and liabilities
in the year ended December 31, 2022, are described in “Main estimates and accounting assumptions”
in Note 5.3.2 of the Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum. We base our assumptions and estimates on parameters
available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and
assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or
circumstances arising beyond our control. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they
occur.


-----

**_Share-Based Payments_**

We have granted share subscription rights, purchase options, phantom shares and free shares to
certain employees of the Group under various incentive plans. As of June 30, 2023, approximately
200 employees benefited from an eight-year incentive plan. In particular, we have entered into longterm incentive plans with certain key employees, which consist of multi-year schemes separate from
remuneration contracts that are either cash-settled, with phantom shares exercisable after four to eight
years, or equity-settled, with free shares currently expected to be granted until the year ended
December 31, 2029. The amounts due under these incentive plans depend on certain assumptions with
respect to future profits of the Group or future profits of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as on the
equity value of the Group (using a fair market value approach based on the expected value creation of
the Group, the volatility of the industry and an appropriate discount rate).

**_Earn-out Payments / Put Option Rights in Favor of Minority Shareholders_**

Following external growth transactions, we may commit to pay former or minority shareholders either
earn-outs or an acquisition price adjustment pursuant to put options on their remaining shareholdings,
based on prices depending on future profits. Related debts are accounted for in the balance sheet at
their present value. We estimate these debts using assumptions on future profits and calculate
scheduled cash outflows using a discount rate.

**_Taxes_**

Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws,
and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business
relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences
arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions,
could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. We establish
provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities
of the respective countries in which we operate. The amount of such provisions is based on various
factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by
the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a
wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of our
companies.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgment is
required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely
timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

**Changes in Accounting Policies**

For information regarding recent and pending changes to our accounting policies, see “Standard and
interpretations that are not yet effective have not been applied by anticipation by the group” in Note
5.3.1 of the Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, included elsewhere

###### Overview

We operate in the global television and digital content industry, which has traditionally had a value
chain made up of five component groups: producers, distributors, broadcasters, channels and
platforms, each of which traditionally committed to addressing a single vertical within the market.
The production and distribution components have largely consolidated, with many broadcasters (such
as BBC Worldwide), major studios (such as Disney, Warner Bros., Discovery and NBC Universal)
and scaled studios (including independents, such as Banijay) having both production and distribution
in-house. There remain a large number of independent producers who tend to operate on a somewhat
smaller scale and usually do not have distribution capabilities.

Next in the value chain are broadcasters/channels, which may be public service broadcasters (such as
PBS in the United States, France Télévisions in France, ARD in Germany, ABC in Australia and the
BBC in the United Kingdom), commercial channels (such as ABC in the United States, ProSieben in
Germany and TF1 in France), thematic pay TV channels (such as Canal Plus Group in France and
HGTV in the United States) or premium pay TV channels (such as Sky in the United Kingdom, Canal
Plus in France, Movistar in Spain and HBO in the United States). Platforms are also an important part
of the global television value chain and may be cable (such as Virgin Media), satellite (such as Sky or
DIRECTV), internet protocol television “IPTV” (such as BT), digital terrestrial television “DTT”
(such as Freeview) or VOD. VOD platforms, which continue to drive change in our industry, may be
AVOD (such as Pluto TV), subscription-funded “SVOD” (including in-house SVOD players such as
Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and Hulu) or transactional “TVOD” (such as iTunes Store and Google
Play). Television viewing generally has two axes: traditional “linear” viewing, ordinarily on a TV set,
and OTT viewing on a TV set, computer or mobile device (including VOD viewing), with some
platforms, such as the BBC, offering both linear and VOD viewing options.

The proliferation of OTT platforms in recent years has led to a significant improvement in quality and
breadth of available content, and the subsequent implementation of various packages and tiers has
given viewers increased optionality in how they want to consume content. The market is saturated,
with both entertainment and technology platforms (such as Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video)
offering scaled services. The following graphics shows the global traditional TC and OTT video
projected market growth between 2018 and 2027:

Over its approximately 70-year history, the global television industry has grown consistently and is
currently in a period of significant transition and development. At its advent, television was a
relatively restricted local industry, with two to four broadcasters in most countries, public service
broadcasters dominating and highly regulated commercial networks. From the late 1970s, the industry
entered a period of liberalization in which pay TV channels emerged and expanded in an environment
of regulatory relaxation and economies that boosted demand for advertising. In the late 1980s,
satellite and cable offerings drove multi-channel offers in many markets, while premium sports and
movie programming also expanded. Beginning around 2000, the “content revolution” saw formatted
non-scripted content spread across the globe and develop into international brands, which was boosted
by technological improvements such as digital television and broadband acceleration. The present
period is characterized by another set of technological improvements and consumption shifts, with the
rapid expansion of OTT viewing as well as internet-based television content aimed at the global
market, the growth of the Asian and Latin American television markets and a shift in power along the
value chain in favor of content and direct-to-consumer offerings.

**Linear Television Market Outlook**

The linear television market has remained critical to media companies’ business models, but is
anticipated to decline significantly in the coming years as viewers pivot to OTT offerings. Media
players have resultingly accelerated content available on streaming platforms, including sports, news
and entertainment. For players that have both a linear and digital offering, streaming spend tends to
make up a greater portion of content budgets. This trend is expected to continue, with total spending
for each expected to be near equal by the middle of the decade, including sports spend. It is expected
that the ongoing shift of content to streaming platforms will have implications on pay TV subscribers.
OTT providers have historically shown a high correlation between their content spend and subscriber
growth. As content becomes increasingly digital, this may create a negative compounding effect on
linear subscribers, as well as increasing cost of service as the price of the bundle rises. Consumer
cord-cutting, in favor of streaming options, continues to accelerate. Decline across linear pay TV
began in the middle of the last decade and have since further accelerated and are expected to create
even more challenging conditions for linear television looking ahead.

**VOD Television Market Outlook**

As linear TV continues to decline, direct-to-consumer is the key driver of growth for the television
market. The number of VOD options available to consumers has multiplied during the decline of
linear TV. Growth in this market has increased competitive pressure and turned differentiation
amongst platforms into a determining factor for success. Players are now attempting to draw interest
through varying business models, niche services, sports offerings and exclusive content across the
landscape. Pricing pressure is constantly intensifying, requiring VOD players to invest to add value to
their services and retain users. Many players such as Netflix, Amazon and Apple have built their own
production studios to create original content for their platforms and differentiate themselves from
competitors. Most players have also adopted and combined multiple monetization approaches in order
to attract a wide range of subscribers. Players are expected to increasingly integrate advertising-based


-----

models to offer VOD at no cost or for a lower end-user price than possible from an SVOD or TVOD
model to generate additional revenues. In addition, in the current context of rising inflation and in
markets with price-sensitive customers, combined monetization strategies have been widely adopted
by operators.

The global VOD market has been growing at strong rates during the past three years and presents
significant growth potential. In 2022, the OTT video segment generated revenues of approximately
$88 billion. This segment is expected to increase at a CAGR of 6.7% from 2022 to 2026. The VOD
market experienced significant revenue growth during 2020 and 2021, driven by the COVID-19
pandemic outbreak, quarantine policies and new hybrid working models. The main growth drivers
have subsequently become the expansion of both high-speed internet connections and smart devices
and the continuous creation of original content. As the VOD market matures in developed regions,
such as North America and Europe, service penetration in other areas, such as Latin America, Africa,
and the Asia-Pacific region, will continue to boost the total addressable market for services.
Compelling new and original content is key to attracting SVOD subscribers in these markets.
Moreover, retaining subscribers month-to-month requires substantial investments. Locally produced
content is key to the attraction and retention of viewers, which has driven global players to spend both
on acquired titles, as well as on original commissions in a range of new markets.

**The Global Content Production Industry**

Content production revenues are projected to grow sustainably, underpinned by (i) OTT platforms
(particularly global SVOD players Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, and in recent years, tech giants
Amazon and Apple) that drive both supply and demand for content and increase levels of competition
as well as total investment, (ii) competitive pressure across the media landscape to increase or
maintain their levels of content investment in order to retain their audiences and (iii) the increasing
influence of Asian content markets, particularly as large importers of content from Europe and North
America.

- _Development and creation of new content: Content producers such as Banijay create and develop_
new program concepts, known as formats, for television broadcasters and digital platforms, such
as VOD platforms. Programs and formats may be either “non-scripted,” such as reality shows,
entertainment shows, game shows or talk shows, or “scripted,” such as comedies or dramas that
follow a written story and plot line. Content may either be produced by the producer who created
the program or format, or by a third party that acquires the rights to produce the content through a
licensing agreement for a specific program or format and a specific geography. Content has
traditionally been developed to cater to the viewer preferences of specific geographic markets but
is increasingly being developed for wider audiences on a global scale, driven by the content offer
of global VOD services.

- _Commissioning and sale of new content: Once a program or format has been developed, it is_
pitched to broadcasters and/or digital platforms. A pitch generally includes a detailed description
of the program or format or, in certain instances, a full “pilot” is prepared by the production
company, either at its own expense or with the financial support from the broadcaster or digital
platform. The sales process for a format also generally includes the preparation of detailed
production schedules and budgets for the broadcaster or digital platform to consider when
deciding whether or not to commission a program or format. A program or format may either be
originated (for example, a new program or format is commissioned by a broadcaster or digital
platform), or it may be acquired (for example, the rights to an existing format are licensed for
local adaptation by a broadcaster or digital platform).

- _Production and airing of new content: Once a broadcaster or digital platform has confirmed the_
commissioning or purchase of a program or format, the production process begins and programs
based on the format are put into production. Production processes vary significantly depending on
the type of format or program, but generally involve pre-filming preparatory work, filming,
content editing and preparation of the program for delivery to the broadcaster or digital platform.


-----

Scripted programs generally require a more cost- and time-intensive development and production
process, as compared with non-scripted programs. The commissioning broadcaster or digital
platform generally have no obligation to air a program after its delivery.

**The Global Content Distribution Industry**

Content distributors control the rights to the content developed as described above. Distributors enter
into license agreements with licensees (mainly broadcasters and digital platforms), whereby such
licensees may exercise certain rights to a given format or program, including the right to produce
and/or air a format or program for a certain period of time and for a predetermined number of runs in
a specific Territory.

Distribution of content allows production companies to increase their profits because costs associated
with managing and selling a content library are relatively low, as compared to production costs. As a
result, our industry has witnessed significant consolidation of production and distribution functions in
recent years. Certain producers have pursued a vertically-integrated strategy, owning their own
distribution business, as we do with our distribution companies. However, not all producers have their
own distribution business and, as such, will grant licenses to distribution companies to distribute their
formats or programs on their behalf, in exchange for a distribution commission. Historically, large
international production groups such as Fremantle have been focused on maintaining exclusive
intellectual property rights to their content catalogues within the Territories in which they operate: this
business model generates additional production value and distribution revenues from format fees paid
by broadcasters. The royalties generated by the distribution business (the fees distributors receive
from their licensees after deducting their commission) constitute important secondary revenues for the
owners of the intellectual property rights to the format or program.

As part of the commissioning and sale process, the broadcaster or digital platform may try to obtain
ownership of the intellectual property rights to the program and/or the format itself. The owner of the
intellectual property rights will generally control the future use of the program or format across
jurisdictions and will, as a result, benefit from additional revenues generated, for example by
exporting the format to additional markets and worldwide program sales. Depending on the market,
broadcasters may retain all or part of such rights in the program and/or format. Otherwise, production
companies, including Banijay, retain full intellectual property rights to the format and program. The
ability to capitalize on formats or programs in forms other than the initial licensing to broadcasters
and digital platforms varies from one format or program to another. The additional rights received by
a producer from the content it has produced are known as “secondary rights.” In some cases, the
producer has no secondary rights, and in other cases, it may only have the right to distribute the
content in certain media and Territories for a limited term, depending on the ownership of the format
and the agreement with the relevant broadcaster or digital platform. Additional rights, or “ancillary
rights,” related to a format or program may also be granted to licensees, such as for merchandising,
music rights, DVD sales, digital services and mobile applications. These ancillary rights can drive
further revenues.

**Key Market Drivers**

Companies that are in the television and digital content production and distribution industry have
historically operated a B2B business model, with broadcasters, channels and platforms as their
primary customers. As a result, the dynamics affecting the production and distribution markets were
for a long time closely tied to those that impacted the wider broadcasting and television industry.
However, due to the emergence of new content buyers (such as VOD platforms) and even some
vertically-integrated direct-to-consumer offerings (such as Netflix), this traditional approach is
changing. Traditional industry players are continuing to invest in original content (both scripted and
non-scripted) largely driven by the competitive nature of the OTT space, which places independent
content developers, producers and distributors such as Banijay in a favorable position. The key forces
that are currently driving the global television and digital content industry are technological shifts


-----

caused by the rise of OTT services, a rationalization and strategic deployment of content spend and
the focus on global markets as areas of high growth potential.

**_Tailwinds in OTT Viewership and Recalibration of the Industry_**

The key technological force that continues to drive the market is the rise of OTT services, on the back
of the “broadband revolution” of the early 2000s. OTT platforms’ market share continue to increase.
Their rise has transformed the industry and has forced industry players to adapt and adjust their
business models. The reach of OTT technology is significant and continues to grow, albeit at a slower
pace.

At the end of 2022, Netflix had approximately 231 million subscribers worldwide, while Amazon had
roughly 245 million subscribers to its “Prime” service, which includes its streaming video offering.
One significant trend in the space, which will help to fuel further subscriber growth, is the
introduction of ad-supported tiers. Netflix, Disney+ and Max have launched ad-funded tiers in the
past two years, creating cheaper service tiers in which a portion of revenue is supported through
advertising. Long-term, these can expand the user base for their services by reaching new audiences.
Given these tiers are cheaper than paying for ad-free options, consumers are more likely to be willing
to subscribe to multiple platforms. As ad-supported tiers are further rolled out globally, and niche
services with lower price points become more common, the number of services consumers are willing
to pay for may increase. Given India and China represent significant markets due to the size of their
respective populations and the smaller extent of DTC penetration, they may present room for
especially significant growth. Lower penetration of SVOD may also be the result of slower broadband
speed, lack of local content and late market entry of local players.

The OTT environment is dominated by global players Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. There are
also a number of strong local players (most of whom are broadcaster-led) who tend to put more focus
on innovation and on local content and production in order to compete with global players. Excluding
spending on sports, NBC Universal (approximately $21 billion), Disney (approximately $20 billion),
Warner Bros. Discovery (approximately $18 billion) and Netflix (approximately $17 billion) spent the
highest amounts on content in 2022. This spend is relatively flat compared to 2021. The amount of
spending is still significant, though competitors tend to prioritize profitability and cash flow
generation. Original content is still prioritized and drives viewership, often at a large expense, and
half of Netflix’s content streaming in the United States is original.

In addition to their increasing consumer base, OTT have an outsized influence on the content market,
as trends that first manifest at the OTT-level, such as binge-watching of boxed set content, tend to
migrate to traditional platforms. For example, networks now look for global reach with brands such as
_Planet Earth._

**_Rationalization and Deployment of Content Spend_**

OTT services are driving changes to consumer behavior in terms of (i) viewing patterns and (ii)
demand for content.

_Viewing patterns show shift towards on-demand_

“Linear” viewing on a television set has largely been replaced by on demand viewing. On demand
viewing may take many forms, from time-shifted viewing on traditional broadcast television channels
to the various online and/or streaming VOD options.

_Platform strategies are changing how dollars are spent on content_

As a result of the shift towards online and on demand viewing, content supply is expected to
increasingly reflect the demands of OTT audiences, which are currently characterized by viewer
appetite for high-budget scripted content and more globalized viewer tastes. Content spend is


-----

expected to continue increasing, albeit at a slower pace, due to the continued investment by VOD
players, new sources of revenue from online offerings and innovation in content forms.

At present, viewer demand is still largely focused on high-budget scripted content, which is driving
the majority of spend. Quality is becoming more important to drive engagement and subscriber
growth, rather than quantity of releases. Global content spend, which saw double digit growth in 2021
and mid-single digit growth in 2022, is expected to grow by approximately 2% in 2023. This is
partially due to the general macroeconomic environment and inflation, which along with shifting
investor sentiment towards sustainable profitability, has forced streaming companies to be more
efficient and targeting with their spending. One way in which this is happening is through a reduction
in the number of scripted TV shows ordered by some of the biggest and most established players,
notably Netflix. On the other hand, newer such as Amazon and Apple, are increasing their scripted
original TV series orders as they attempt to scale their platforms. While orders slow down, there is
still strong demand for new releases, which could lead to an imbalance of demand and supply. Nonscripted content can help to fill the gap, given the cheaper cost to produce and shorter time needed.
Banijay has particular experience and strength in non-scripted content and demand continues to be
high for this type of materials, which are especially lucrative.

Content spend has been relatively resilient during downturns. During the dot-com crash in the early
2000s content spend continued to rise, even as advertising revenues fell, and during the 2008 financial
crisis, content spend remained stable in Western Europe, even as advertising revenues dropped
precipitously. At the end of 2023, global content spend is projected to increase to approximately $243
billion, with continued growth partially driven by Apple and Amazon’s continued expansion into the
industry.

**_Global Markets as an Area of High Growth Potential_**

As the SVOD markets of North America and Western Europe mature, winning new subscribers is
becoming a notable challenge. Compelling new and original content is key to attracting SVOD


-----

subscribers in these markets, but is expensive. Moreover, retaining subscribers signed up month-tomonth requires ongoing investment. There is more headroom for the global streaming market to grow
in less developed markets, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Locally produced content is key to
attracting and retaining subscribers, which has driven global players to spend not just on acquired
titles but on original commissions in a range of new markets. Latin America is also a lucrative OTT
market. It currently trails most other regions in number of OTT users, but is expected to grow
significantly over the coming years. Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are key countries in the region.
Among others, the significant increase over time in the numbers of OTT users is the rising number of
local-language competitors in the region, even as international players such as Netflix have already
found success. In Mexico, TelevisaUnivision has Blue To Go Sports and PrendeTV, and in Brazil,
Globo TV has Globoplay. These services are helping to further acclimate the local population to the
OTT video.

**Our Key Markets**

Banijay operates across markets in 21 countries, including 14 countries in Europe (Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Nordic Countries, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the
United Kingdom), three countries in the Americas (Brazil, Mexico and the United States), three
countries in the Asia Pacific region (Australia, India and New Zealand) and one country in the rest of
the world (Israel). While we expect that most of our key markets will generally continue to expand in
the near future, growth may be slower than in previous years. The television industry is generally
highly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, particularly in sectors that rely on advertising
revenues. Further, while the rise of OTT may challenge traditional broadcasters, channels and
platforms, we believe their growth represents an opportunity for content producers, especially for
players such as Banijay, because they drive content demand and represent a growing segment of
content consumers. Each of our key markets requires a tailored approach to produce and distribute
content successfully. In particular, the balance between traditional platforms and emerging OTT
services vary in popularity and penetration across our key markets.

**_France_**

In 2022, the main pay TV players in the French market were Orange, Bouygues Telecom, SFR and
Canal Plus (which acquired Orange’s film and pay TV assets in January 2023), while TF1 is the main
broadcaster, followed by France Télévisions and M6. Independent producers outnumber in-house
broadcast production companies and are very active in the television production sector. The high
number of independent producers in France is due in part to the fact that French law requires
broadcasters to dedicate at least 67% of their investments in audiovisual works to independent
production. The largest players in the French independent production sector, other than Banijay, are
Fremantle and Newen.

**_Nordic Countries (Denmark and Sweden)_**

The main pay TV players in Denmark are TDC and Boxer Denmark and in Sweden are Tele 2 and
Allente, while DR and TV 2 are the main broadcasters in Denmark and SVT and TV4 are the main
broadcasters in Sweden. The major independent production players in Denmark, other than Banijay,
are Fremantle, NICE Entertainment and Red Arrow Studios. The Swedish independent production
industry is dominated by local independent producer NICE Entertainment, who competes with
international production houses such as Banijay, Fremantle and ITV Studios.

**_United States_**

The United States is an important geographic market in terms of both production and consumption.
The primary commercial networks are CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox and the primary pay TV market is
fragmented, with many platforms (such as Charter, Comcast and AT&T) offering similar packages.
The major U.S. studios (including Disney, Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery) dominate the
production sector, but the independent production sector remains fragmented.


-----

**_Italy_**

The broadcast market in Italy is consolidated, with three networks (RAI, Mediaset and La7)
dominating the market. The main pay TV players are Sky Italia, Mediaset and Telecom Italia. The
production industry in Italy has had success in altering global formats for an Italian audience and is
led by, other than Banijay, independent production players such as Fremantle.

**_United Kingdom_**

The United Kingdom is a leading geographic market for the creation and launch of formats because
broadcasters demonstrate a willingness to experiment with new ideas and the legal framework
protects producers’ rights to their programs. Competition in the United Kingdom is high among
network broadcasters, as the broadcast market is highly fragmented, with BBC One holding the
highest weekly reach of all TV channels (58%), followed by ITV1, BBC Two, Channel 4 and Channel
5. The main pay TV players are Sky, Virgin Media, BT and Talk Talk. The production industry in the
United Kingdom is made up of key independent production players such as Banijay, All3Media,
Avalon TV, Carnival Films, Fremantle and Left Bank.

**Competitive Landscape**

Competition in the television and digital content production and distribution sectors remains
fragmented: in many markets, a number of small, independent groups are important market
participants. We have observed in recent years a trend towards significant consolidation within our
industry, particularly through vertical consolidation and business combinations of market participants
with one another. We believe that this consolidation is driven, in part, by market players’ desire to
expand their content portfolios, thereby allowing them to further develop their capacity to
successfully distribute their formats and programs. For example, most leading production groups also
have established distribution businesses. This branch of activity allows them to market and sell their
content and formats internationally to broadcasters and digital platforms. We have been an active and
successful player in the consolidation of our industry and Banijay has been the only significant
producer and distributor with worldwide operations that has managed to remain independent, as the
majority of large European production houses are now controlled by established broadcasting groups.

We are the world’s leading independent producer and distributor of content based on revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2022 and in terms of hours of content as of June 30, 2023. Banijay
competes with other integrated production and distribution groups such as ITV Studios, Fremantle
and All3Media, as well as smaller independent production companies, such as Tinopolis. Certain
competitors, such as ITV Studios, have experienced significant growth through M&A activity in
recent years. This is a reflection of the overall consolidation trend in the industry.

There are four key types of players in the global content production and distribution industry: major
studios (such as Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney), in-house content divisions (such as ITV
Studios and BBC Worldwide), scaled studios (including independents such as Banijay) and smaller
independents (such as Hat Trick and Beta), with local players, although locally significant, having a
comparatively small global role.

- _Major studios:_ major studios, most of which are based in the U.S., such as Warner Bros.
Discovery and Disney, tend to produce high-quality and expensive scripted content. Although we
do produce scripted content and intend to focus more resources on scripted content in the future,
we do not typically directly compete with major studios for content production contracts. Major
studios tend to have integrated production and distribution businesses.

- _In-house content divisions:_ certain broadcasters, such as BBC or ITV in the United Kingdom,
maintain their own in-house production departments. Some players have large in-house
departments, which can handle all content needs, but smaller players are often forced to outsource


-----

their content production to third parties. Companies with in-house production capacities are
integrated, as both production and distribution is done in-house.

- _Scaled studios (including independents):_ scaled studios (including independents) are often
established through business combination transactions whereby independent producers in various
markets are combined into one international group. In order to succeed and maximize market
share, these groups typically maintain a presence in the United Kingdom and the United States in
light of these markets’ importance for the overall industry. Scaled studios (including
independents) are free to experiment with different content formats and pursue various production
avenues. They are well-known for producing non-scripted formats which are popular with
broadcasters as they tend to be low-risk opportunities as their production costs are significantly
lower than scripted content. Scaled studios (including independents), including Banijay, tend to
have integrated production and distribution businesses.

- _Smaller independents: independent companies are generally groups whose activities are limited to_
a specific domestic or specialist market. In general, small independents focus on a particular niche
area or may even specialize in a specific show format and are known for producing creative
content and are often on the cutting edge of innovation. Smaller independent companies include
Elephant in France, Hat Trick and Avalon in the United Kingdom and Ballandi in Italy and 7 y
Accion and Zebra TV in Spain. Smaller independents tend not to, but may, have integrated
production and distribution businesses.

The major players in the global content distribution industry are largely the same as in the global
content production industry, following the consolidation of many key producers with distributors in
recent years.

###### BUSINESS 

**Overview**

We are the world’s leading independent producer and distributor of content based on revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2022. We are also the world’s leading independent producer and distributor
of content in terms of hours of content as of June 30, 2023. We develop, produce and distribute
television formats and programs and digital content for a wide range of customers. We operate over
130 production companies across 21 countries and have a multi-genre catalogue boasting over
172,000 hours of content. We have produced successful, and at times, long-running scripted and nonscripted formats and programs, such as _Survivor, Temptation Island, Peaky Blinders, Big Brother,_
_MasterChef, Rogue Heroes, Hunted, Black Mirror, LEGO Masters, Deal or No Deal, Grantchester,_
_Don’t Forget The Lyrics!, Marie Antoinette, Fort Boyard, Versailles, Mr. Bean and_ _Good Karma_
_Hospital. Our broad brand portfolio and large creative platform position us to continue to nurture and_
drive new formats for broadcasters and digital platforms.

We generate revenues through (i) the production of formats and programs; (ii) the distribution of
formats and programs for which we hold and/or control intellectual property rights and are entitled to
revenues generated by such formats and programs and (iii) commercial activities related to our brands
and programs, such as merchandising, sponsorship, licensing, digital partnerships, music and live
events. We produce both scripted and non-scripted content across all genres, including reality,
entertainment and talk shows, game shows, factual entertainment, documentary, drama, animation (or
kids) and comedy. Non-scripted content includes titles that do not follow a written storyline (for
example, entertainment, game shows or reality) and generated the majority of our revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2022, while scripted content includes programs that follow a written
scenario, which mainly consists of drama and comedy.

We own intellectual property rights to a broad and diversified portfolio of formats and programs, and
we generated the majority of our production revenues from our owned intellectual property for the
year ended December 31, 2022. The programs we own and/or control were distributed and licensed,
through our subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited, to approximately 1,050 licensees, including linear
broadcasters and digital platforms worldwide, and we sold our products into 249 territories, in each
case for the year ended December 31, 2022. We retain (either through full ownership or control
pursuant to long-term and exclusive distribution contracts with third-party producers) the intellectual
property rights to most of our formats and programs. Such intellectual property rights are assets that
we generally distribute internationally and from which we seek to generate secondary revenues, such
as licensing of exploitation rights to broadcasters and digital platforms and sales of finished tapes and
branded content, in each case to supplement our initial production revenues.

We employ creative talents across all territories in which we operate in order to develop original
formats and produce original television programs based on our analysis of trends in the industry and
the demands of our customers. Thanks to our significant scale and the scope of our business, we have
access to a wide variety of industry-leading talents worldwide and high-quality creative content. For
the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated €3,242 million of revenues, of which €2,676
million (or 83% of total revenues) were production revenues, €413 million (or 12% of total revenues)
were distribution revenues and €153 million (or 5% of total revenues) were secondary revenues. For
the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our Run-Rate Revenues was €3,609 million, our Run-Rate
Adjusted EBITDA was €544 million and our Adjusted Free Cash Flow was €347 million.

**Our Strengths**

We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and provide us with
competitive advantages in the markets in which we operate:


-----

**_World’s Leading Independent Content Producer and Distributor_**

We are the world’s leading independent producer and distributor of content based on revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2022, as well as catalogue depth in the independent production sector, with
an unmatched library of over 172,000 hours of content as of June 30, 2023. The following graphic
shows the revenues and catalogue depth of the producers that we consider to be our main competitors:

______________

(1) Represents data as of December 31, 2022 for Banijay, and latest available market data for other players.

(2) Excludes major U.S. studios such as Disney and Warner Brothers, as well as independent players such as MGM and Lionsgate.

While the global content spend market represented approximately $238 billion as of December 31,
2022, according to Ampere, the top players mentioned in the graphic above represented
approximately 8% of that market, reflecting a long tail-end of smaller players in the sector and the
overall fragmented nature of the industry. Within this largely fragmented content production
landscape, we are well positioned as a global leader benefitting from an international, independent
studio and a largely de-risked business model, underpinned by a cost-plus pricing base of our
productions wherein customers finance the entire production costs for most non-scripted shows. The
following graphic shows the characteristics of the main types of players in the global content spend
market:

Our leading position as the largest international independent studio positions us favorably in
comparison with other business models within the content production landscape. This landscape
mainly comprises (i) in-house production departments of SVOD operators and broadcasters (e.g.
Netflix and Apple), which have less independence, (ii) major U.S. studios (e.g. Comcast, Disney,
Lionsgate, Paramount and Sony), which operate a vertical, riskier business model, (iii) smaller
independent players, which tend to have niche, sub-scale operations lacking critical size, in addition to


-----

(iv) independent studios with scale such as the Group. Our favorable positioning within this
competitive landscape ensures that we benefit from a largely de-risked business model as well as from
scale and independence, allowing us to optimally roll our existing successful content and new
upcoming releases across geographies, formats and distribution partners.

**_Attractive Market with Growing Demand for Content Driven by SVOD Platforms_**

We continue to operate in a global and attractive market characterized by stable growth, which has
proven to be resilient, including throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the last ten years, global
content spend has almost doubled in absolute terms, as demonstrated by the following graphic:

The growth in global content spend is expected to continue to be driven largely by the surging
demand from SVOD platforms, which is expected to grow by more than 21% per year from 2020 to
2025, as demonstrated by the following graphic:

In addition, SVOD platforms have recently increased their exposure to non-scripted content, with the
number of non-scripted shows on SVOD platforms in the United States more than tripling over the
last three years from 125 shows in 2019 to 397 shows in 2022. We believe that we are well positioned
to benefit from this trend thanks to our strong non-scripted production capabilities, which allow us to
produce formats in a hub model for SVOD in several countries. Broadcaster demand has also
remained resilient, despite increasing pressures on advertising revenues.

**_Platform Agnostic and Highly Diversified Revenue Base Across Geographies, Genres, Customers_**
**_and Shows_**

We are a global producer and distributor of content, generating revenues in 21 countries, including 14
countries in Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Nordic Countries, Poland,
Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), three countries in the Americas (Brazil,
Mexico and the United States), three countries in the Asia Pacific region (Australia, India and New
Zealand) and one country in the rest of the world (Israel). For the twelve months ended June 2023,
48% of our revenues were generated in Europe, 31% in the Americas and 21% in the rest of the
world. Thanks to our broad portfolio of successful formats and programs that can be adapted to a
variety of audiences across multiple geographies, we believe we are well-positioned to maintain and
grow our share in our current markets. Our distribution business enables us to license our portfolio of


-----

formats and programs around the world, including to customers located in markets in which we do not
currently maintain production operations. Notably, our catalogue of non-scripted content (including
our “super brands”) is available in a broad range of non-English languages, allowing us to capitalize
on the growth of streaming platforms outside of the U.S. and to reach audiences globally.

We work with a broad network of customers and partners, including broadcasters, television channels,
producers and digital platforms active in the markets in which we operate, as well as with licensees,
retailers of consumer products and commercial partners from around the world. Our main production
customers include broadcasters such as France Télévisions, TF1 Group, ITV, the BBC, Channel 4
Television, FOX, CBS, Bravo, Antena 3, TVE, Channel 5, RTL Group, TV2 Denmark, NENT, DR
Denmark, TV4 Sweden, SKY, Mediaset, Rai Uno, Canal Plus Group, ABC Network, NBC,
Discovery and MTV. We are also platform agnostic, which allows us to nurture relationships with
numerous digital platforms, including SVOD providers (such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video,
Disney+, Discovery+, HBO Max, Paramount+ and Peacock) and AVOD platforms (such as Globo,
Pluto and Freevee). For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 18% of our total revenues
were generated from OTT players, an increase of approximately 10% compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our eight biggest customers contributed
to 43% of our total production revenues, with none of our customers individually contributing to more
than 12% of our total revenues during the same period. In addition, we often have multiple contracts,
which address multiple formats and geographies, with individual customers. Similarly, our top 15
shows collectively contributed to 17% of our production revenues for the year ended December 31,
2022, with none of our shows individually contributing to more than 2% of our production revenues
during the same period. The following graphics show, for the year ended December 31, 2022, our
production revenues (i) by top customers and (ii) by top shows:

**Production Revenues by Customers** **Production Revenues by Shows**

Although we have historically focused on developing non-scripted formats across various genres, we
have also significantly expanded our scripted activity to meet our customers’ and the market’s
increasing demand for scripted content. For the year ended December 31, 2022, non-scripted content
generated €2,134 million, or 80%, of our production revenues, with the remaining €531 million, or
20%, generated by scripted content, which we believe is generally the appropriate mix for our
operations. The following graphics show, for the year ended December 31, 2022, our production
revenues by (i) genre, and (ii) geography:

**Production Revenues by Genre** **Production Revenues by Geography**

**_Proven Ability to Develop Long-Lasting Worldwide Brands Generating Primary and Secondary_**
**_Revenues_**

We have a proven track record of producing and distributing long-lasting and travelling content (i.e.,
formatted content which can be adapted by our companies worldwide), which have become durable
“super brands”. We define such “super brands” as premium unscripted formats with robust returning
appeal across at least ten different markets with significant production budgets, and which are
profitable in the context of a large-scale distribution. We are the content producer that has adapted the
most unscripted formats globally, such as Deal or No Deal (launched in 2002, and adapted in over 80
territories), Big Brother (launched in 1999, and adapted in over 70 territories), MasterChef (launched
in 1990, and adapted in over 60 territories) and Minute to Win It (launched in 2010, and adapted in
over 50 territories). We have increasingly focused on formats that, once produced for one market, can
be licensed internationally to reach customers in other markets. For the year ended December 31,
2022, our top travelling formats were MasterChef (active in 39 territories), Big Brother (active in 33
territories), _Survivor (active in 21 territories) and_ _LEGO Masters (active in 15 territories). The_
following table shows a breakdown of some of our most successful long-lasting and travelling
programs and formats by (i) genre, (ii) number of active years since launch, (iii) country of origin, (iv)
total number of territories since launch (which represents the number of format adaptations for nonscripted shows and licensing of finished tapes for scripted shows) and (v) customers:

Our diversified portfolio of long-standing and travelling formats and programs is supported by “360degree” monetization of our formats and programs. This approach allows us to monetize our content
from the production of new formats and programs to be sold to broadcasters and digital platforms, to
the licensing of existing formats to third parties and the sale of programs to generate distribution
revenues and leverage our strong brands to create secondary revenues through commercial activities
such as merchandising, sponsorship, digital partnerships, music and live events. The following
graphic shows our revenues by business type (production, distribution and other, excluding
intercompany revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2022:

**Revenues by Genre**

We generate the majority of our revenues from our owned intellectual property, which provides us
with exclusivity and control on the worldwide production and distribution of our owned formats and
programs, as well as the further potential to generate secondary revenues from the programs and
formats for which we own intellectual property rights. In addition, our distribution and secondary


-----

revenues businesses generate high margins, providing royalties to production companies and owners
of intellectual property rights, as we incur limited direct costs to maintain our library of programs.
The following graphic illustrates how our 360-monetization strategy operates across scripted and nonscripted content:

**_Strong Track Record of Successfully Integrating Value Accretive Acquisitions_**

We have a history of successfully pursuing various selective and value-enhancing strategic
acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures intended to complement and/or expand our
business. We regularly pursue value-accretive bolt-on acquisitions to acquire production companies
and/or intellectual property rights in the markets where we are present. Thanks to these acquisitions,
we are able to expand into new markets or genres in a particular market, access new talent, acquire
intellectual property rights of formats and programs developed by such companies and benefit from
the expertise of their creative talents or producers. Some of our most recent acquisitions and
significant investments include Beyond in Australia in December 2022, A Fábrica in Brazil in March
2023, Twenty Two Productions in the Netherlands in March 2023, as well as our joint venture with
LaLiga in Spain in June 2023. Further, in June 2023, we agreed to acquire a controlling stake in
Balich, an Italian live entertainment business in charge of creating, producing and delivering live
shows and experiences that engage live audiences worldwide, active in 20 countries, in line with our
strategy to expand our live event activities. The following timeline shows our bolt-on acquisitions
made during the development of our business:

We also have a proven track record of successfully integrating large groups and implementing
synergies within a short period of time following transformative acquisitions. For example, in 2020,
the completion of the Endemol Shine Acquisition allowed us to become the leading independent
player in Europe with the highest number of scripted content launches in 2022, thereby gaining the
scale necessary to address the strong appetite in our industry for globally distributed brands. Thanks
to the successful integration of Endemol Shine into the Group, we benefitted from structural
simplification, commercial synergies, IT integration, footprint optimization and rationalization of
third-party service providers, and realized cost synergies of approximately €67 million within a period
of 18 months, exceeding the originally projected cost synergies of approximately €60 million within


-----

24 months. Our net leverage ratio as of September 30, 2019, after giving effect to the Endemol Shine
Acquisition, the financing arrangements entered in connection therewith and the use of proceeds
therefrom, was 5.2x. We have since successfully reduced our total net leverage and are on track to
further reduce it (exclusive of acquisitions that may be consummated (other than the Balich
Acquisition), in the medium term).

We are also focused on pursuing strategic joint ventures, which allow us to be involved in the early
stages of potential successes and, in the long term, to secure the possibility of acquiring a controlling
interest in the underlying company for a price based on a pre-existing formula that takes into account
our investment and support. Since 2018, we have also established several joint ventures in the United
Kingdom and the United States, the most active markets for international scripted shows, including
recent investments in Rabbit Track, Conker and Immovable in the United Kingdom. We also have
successful joint ventures in Mexico, such as Endemol Shine Boomdog, which was formed in 2018 to
capitalize on the growing opportunities in the Mexican and U.S Spanish-language markets.

Thanks to our successful acquisition track-record, we have been able to grow our platform globally,
positioning us well to serve an increasingly global customer base, including OTT players who can
deploy our formats into multiple geographies. We believe that in a fragmented and competitive
industry, our significant scale allows us to increase our leverage when negotiating with broadcasters
and SVOD platforms, diversify our portfolio by introducing new cross-selling opportunities, increase
our financial capacity to fund a large number of formats, offer more competitive production budgets
by leveraging on combined resources and attract and retain talent.

**_A Cash Generative and Resilient Business Model Supported by a Recurring Revenue Base, Strong_**
**_Financial Performance, Cash Flow Visibility and a Flexible Cost Structure_**

Our portfolio of long-standing “super brands,” such as Big Brother, MasterChef, Survivor and
Temptation Island, allows us to benefit from strong and long-term recurring revenues, with 43% of
our production revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 derived from content that has been
running for at least five consecutive seasons, 30% from content that has been running for two to five
consecutive seasons, and only 28% from new launches. Certain of our production companies, such as
Banijay Production Media, Adventure Line Productions and Bunim/Murray Productions have
produced television content for more than 20 years, and we benefit from their long-standing
relationships with broadcasters and other customers. We believe that our ability to propose original
formats with a cost-efficient production process has increased customer loyalty. We have further
expanded our customer base and captured business opportunities associated with the rise of SVOD
providers by developing relationships with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Discovery+,
HBO Max, Paramount+ and Peacock.

Over the last three years, we have achieved significant Adjusted EBITDA improvement, which has
grown from €262 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €482 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. Following our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, our Adjusted EBITDA
margin levels normalized to 15% for the year ended December 31, 2022, demonstrating resilience
against inflation thanks to our cost-plus pricing-based business model, which allows us to pass on a
significant amount of incremental costs to our customers. This is higher than the average EBITDA
margin over the last three years of the producers that we consider to be our main competitors. We
have also reduced our leverage and maintained strong cash generation, with Adjusted Free Cash Flow
ranging from €256 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €349 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. Our average cash conversion ratio for the same period was 83.2%, due in 2020 to
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our production, tax and social security payments, and in
2021 to a favorable working capital cut-off effect at the end of the year and the normalization of our
production activities after the COVID-19 pandemic.We intend to continue to implement our
acquisition schemes based on earn-outs and put options in order to limit our cash interest expense.

We believe we have a largely de-risked business model. Our revenue benefits from the longevity of
our returning formats, such as Survivor, Big Brother, _MasterChef and Deal or No Deal. The majority_
of our formats air for more than one season, which generates long-term revenue streams and


-----

significant visibility into our operating performance as we secure budgeted revenues through contracts
signed early in the production process, and some of our returning formats benefit from multi-season
deals with broadcasters and digital platforms. These formats continue to be successful, for instance
with the 24[th] season of _Big Brother being viewed for approximately 8.3 billion minutes across all_
platforms in two months, with particular success in the U.S., and Survivor airing 25 series across 24
territories. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 28% and 73% of the Group’s production revenues
were generated by new and returning programs, respectively (of which 43% had been running for at
least five consecutive seasons, and 30% for two to five consecutive seasons). As of June 30, 2023, we
had already secured at least 84% of our estimated revenues for the year ending December 31, 2023.
Our business model is also supported by a stable level of content spend, which has been resilient
during economic downturns, as compared to advertisement spend. We have retained our competitive
advantage despite increasing pressures on advertising revenues, thanks to our focus on less expensive
non-scripted content, performing “super brands” that are pillars of traditional broadcasters and costefficient production plans.

We only commence the production for a program once a broadcaster or digital platform has agreed to
pay for the production and acquisition of the rights for such program, and the production costs have
been fully funded. We use the services of a significant number of freelance production artists and
technicians, depending on the level of television production activity in which we are engaged. Such
freelancers allow us to benefit from a flexible cost structure pursuant to which we can adjust our cost
base to the seasonality of production activity throughout the year. We estimate that approximately
80% of our cost structure is flexible. In addition, we attract, retain and incentivize talents via longterm incentive plans which are generally contingent and calculated based on the performance of the
relevant format over a specified time period. Therefore, our production costs and a significant share of
our staff costs are based on our performance and activity levels and are variable in nature.

We operate an asset-light model with limited ongoing capital expenditure requirements (representing
1.8% of revenues, including investments in intellectual property rights, for the year ended December
31, 2022), and low working capital requirements. Non-scripted programs are generally less capitalintensive and more profitable than scripted programs because they have shorter production cycles and
their budgeted production costs are covered in full before production begins. We believe that our mix
of scripted and non-scripted content is generally appropriate for our operations. In the event that we
seek to increase the proportion of our revenues generated by scripted programs, we do not anticipate
having to invest significantly as we expect that third-party financing sources will largely incur the
required upfront investment costs and that we will benefit from our existing catalogue’s distribution
revenues. In addition, we continuously promote financial discipline to maximize cash generation and
monitor our leverage.

**_Highly Experienced and Committed Management Team with Supportive Shareholders_**

The Group has a highly experienced and professional senior management team, consisting of
Stéphane Courbit, Chairman and founder of Banijay, Marco Bassetti, Chief Executive Officer, and
Cédric Brignon, Chief Financial Officer. Both Stéphane Courbit and Marco Bassetti have a successful
track record of television content production. Since 2007, Banijay has become a leading independent
producer of television programs based on revenues. Our management team has a proven track record
of delivering on their budget and has demonstrated strong M&A capabilities, successfully integrating
new businesses into the Group such as the Banijay Zodiak Merger (realizing cost synergies of
approximately €17 million within a period of 10 months) and the Endemol Shine Acquisition
(realizing cost synergies of approximately €67 million within a period of 18 months, exceeding the
originally projected cost synergies of approximately €60 million within 24 months). During the year
ended December 31, 2022, we successfully completed 15 bolt-on acquisition in ten different
countries. Unlike some of our competitors, the Group is led by industry experts who understand our
creative talents and local production managers. This common culture and vision between our
management team and our creative talents have allowed us to attract and retain successful managers,
employees and partners. Furthermore, we benefit from the full support of our shareholders, including
DeA and Vivendi, two groups with a history of investing in the distribution of content and


-----

broadcasters. LOV Group and Vivendi are industry experts who understand the television production
and distribution business and are focused on developing original content. While most of the largest
television content producers in the world are affiliated with an entertainment group or a distribution
network, we remain independent, which enables us to serve customers without the limitations faced
by controlled producers regarding, for example, the content, style and format of their production. Our
independence allows us to innovate, deliver original, differentiated programs, be platform agnostic
and work with and retain a large pool of creative talents. In addition, as a scaled independent
producer, we benefit from competitive advantages compared to the in-house departments of
broadcasters and U.S. studios in Europe, which favor European independent producers.

We believe we are positioned at the forefront of content production and distribution as a premier
home for the industry’s leading on- and off-screen talent, and pride ourselves upon our ability to
attract, grow and retain top creative talent, including creative talent, producers, screenwriters and
directors. We have a number of key initiatives in place in order to further promote workforce
retention. In connection with the acquisition of production companies in various jurisdictions, we
typically enter into earn-out or put option agreements with certain managers and creative talents of
these companies in order to incentivize them to continue to work with us following the completion of
the relevant acquisition. Our management has also implemented a long-term incentive plan to ensure
the commitment of local management teams by rewarding key personnel based on their respective
value creation. In addition, our corporate organization is designed to foster creative freedom,
collaborative entrepreneurialism and commercial acumen. As a responsible employer, we are aware of
the rapid changes in lifestyles and ways of living of our employees, particularly following the
COVID-19 pandemic, and we actively seek to contribute to the improvement of our employees’
quality of life to maintain long, successful and trusting relationships. We have chosen to improve our
employee experience through the implementation of selective remote-working policies to help reduce
commuting stress, free up time and stay competitive in the talent war. We have also committed to
building diverse, supportive and collaborative teams through the development of our global diversity
& inclusion board and employee resource groups.

**Our Strategies**

We intend to further strengthen our business by focusing on the following key strategic objectives.

**_Continue to Create Premium International Content and Secure Intellectual Property Rights_**

Our goal is to continue to focus on high premium formats and programs that can travel to other
territories and be easily distributed globally to broadcasters and digital platforms looking for new
content, such as _Survivor,_ _Big Brother,_ _MasterChef and_ _Deal or No Deal. Through our dedicated_
distribution subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited, we intend to leverage our know-how on successfully
selling or licensing our catalogue, including to customers in markets where we do not produce
content. We also intend to increase the size of our program portfolio to reach new customers in
emerging markets, such as India, where we believe there is great potential for growth in terms of
viewers and where a program based on the same format can be produced for different territories in
different languages, which we have capacity to produce thanks to our local production labels. For the
year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 12% of our total revenues from our distribution
business. Formats that have already been developed and produced, together with existing programs,
can be distributed with comparatively high margins.

We intend to apply our strategy of incentivizing local managing directors to develop adaptable
formats in-house with an international appeal that can generate distribution and other secondary
revenues, together with our proven format-sharing practices. Some of our most anticipated upcoming
releases include _Totally Spies! and_ _Nevsu. In addition, we plan to further develop our relationships_
with third-party producers to secure productions outside our footprint and distribution rights of
premium content through Banijay Rights Limited. We focus on sourcing partnerships and deals that
generate positive returns and making selective investments to secure intellectual property rights from
producers that we believe can deliver new long-running formats. We target premium scripted content
in the English language, which can be easily distributed internationally and is well-suited to the


-----

catalogue of many OTT platforms, as well as formatted non-scripted content which can often be
adapted by our companies worldwide.

We believe that this strategy will allow us to capitalize on current market trends, with SVOD
platforms increasing their demand for non-scripted content, in addition to their traditional focus on
scripted content. We also plan to continue focusing on developing know-how in our different markets
in order to create traction for upcoming formats developed in another country.

**_Optimize Content and Catalogue Monetization on All Platforms Globally_**

In the United States, SVOD services have increased the value of our catalogue series and movies due
to increased viewership by consumers and the correlating demand and spending by digital platforms.
Although these investments are primarily made in the United States and in English-language content,
the European market is gaining an increasing amount of traction with U.S.-based streaming platforms,
which are expanding globally. We also benefit from a supportive regulatory environment in Europe
which helps balancing bargaining powers when negotiating with SVOD platforms, hence allowing for
multiple monetization channels.

As a global independent producer with a proven track record of producing and distributing longlasting and travelling content (through local versions of some of the world’s biggest titles, as well as
original territorial content in local languages), we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these
trends and to efficiently monetize our content across all platforms through our “360-degree” strategy.
We intend to continue developing best-in-class internal format-sharing practices and, due to our size
and decentralized organizational structure, we believe we can tailor our formats and programs to our
target customers more easily than other large production groups, thereby efficiently monetizing our
content and catalogue. In addition, our distribution business enables us to license our portfolio
globally, including in markets in which we do not currently maintain production operations, and
generate revenues with high margins due to the relatively limited costs incurred in managing our
existing formats and programs.

We intend to increase our secondary revenues by better monetizing our large catalogue of over
172,000 hours of content. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 5% of our revenues
from our commercial activity, including secondary revenues. We aim to increase secondary revenues
by taking advantage of in-program digital technologies and other features, and also developing
sponsorships with on-air partners to integrate product placement in our programs and to supplement
broadcasters’ production budgets. The rapidly growing AVOD market represents new secondary
window exploitation opportunities for our content, and we believe we have already positioned
ourselves as a leader in the FAST space to seize such opportunities, thanks to the operation of our
own FAST channels (including Horizons: Powered By Banijay) syndicated on platforms such as Pluto
or Freevee. We are also increasing our presence on social media platforms such as Meta and TikTok
in order to reach online audiences and further monetize our catalogue through digitalization.

In addition, we focus on developing branded content and partnerships with brands to establish content
supplier agreements with key global broadcasters. We try to retain ancillary rights when negotiating
with broadcasters to be able to develop merchandizing, branded events and experiences and off-air
licenses, and exploit the full value chain of our intellectual property rights. For example, we have
entered into a brand licensing arrangement for Peaky Blinders in connection with the development of
a freemium mobile strategy game. We are also able to monetize content with low development costs
through digital platforms with live-streaming capabilities, and through the development of games
based on intellectual property rights which we retain in connection with our formats.

We have leveraged our know-how with in-house talents by creating talent agencies which generate
secondary revenues, having followed the model of the talent management agency managed by
Brainpool. Notably, Banijay Talent operates as a French “influencer” marketing company that helps
brands grow with bespoke influencing strategies, and has generated significant follower growth for
its customer brands and developed key relationships with a large number of influencers from the
television, fashion, beauty, luxury, entertainment and sport sectors. We intend to further emulate the


-----

commercial success of Banijay Talent across other countries where we operate to increase our
secondary revenues.

**_Continue to Attract and Retain the Best Talents_**

We rely on our management team to implement our growth strategies and our creative talents to
produce formats that address our customers’ needs. Attracting, cultivating and retaining talents has
been, and will remain, critical to our success. We plan to continue to attract and retain highly skilled
personnel, particularly for their creative talent. We intend to further strengthen our collaborative and
entrepreneurial culture by continuing to incentivize our local managers to foster the high flexibility,
independence and autonomy of each of our production companies. We also intend to continue to run
our long-term incentive plan to ensure the commitment of local management teams and focus on
further aligning our key personnel’s interests with the Group’s through a focus on value creation.
Similarly, we plan to maintain our Group-wide bonus scheme to incentivize creative talents
responsible for the creation and development of successful formats that are adapted in our key
markets and have generated a certain production value for the Group. Talent attraction and retention is
also bolstered by our talent management systems, which allow us to anticipate departures and plan for
successions in the event of any departures.

Our proven track record of establishing successful joint ventures is also a key part of our talent
acquisition and retention strategy, as joint ventures appeal to talents who would like to maintain their
independence but are interested in a strong partnership with us. Talents of our joint venture partners
benefit from our broad creative network, access to financing, information, contacts and, most
importantly, our catalogue of formats, major brands and distribution capacity. In addition, they may
be able to sell us their remaining shareholding once the business has developed successfully because,
if a joint venture is successful, we may acquire the remaining share capital in the production company
on pre-agreed financial terms while retaining the talents who partnered with us.

**_Consolidate our Leadership Through Selective M&A to Further Strengthen our Position as an_**
**_Integrated Global Entertainment Leader Underpinned by our Content Catalogue and Deep_**
**_Portfolio of Intellectual Property Rights_**

We intend to continue pursuing various selective and value-enhancing strategic acquisitions, business
combinations and joint ventures intended to complement and/or expand our business, in line with our
overall growth plan. We expect such acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures to allow
us to expand our geographic footprint and diversify into new genres and markets, while gaining
access to top local talent. Our platform is scalable and has a demonstrated ability to integrate large
groups and implement synergies within a short period of time following transformative operations,
such as the Banijay Zodiak Merger and the Endemol Shine Acquisition. We also intend to continue
leveraging our distribution subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited, to expand and optimize our content
catalogue through our business combinations. We regularly evaluate M&A opportunities and apply a
disciplined approach, pursuing transactions that comply with our cost-payback and other strategic
selection criteria, seeking targets that are cash generative, additive to the platform and synergistic.
Furthermore, following the Balich Acquisition, we intend to leverage our history of successful
strategic acquisitions to seamlessly integrate Balich into the Group and implement synergies resulting
from the transaction. Moving forward, we plan to fully leverage our management team’s proven track
record of delivering on their budget and use our strong M&A capabilities to sustainably consolidate
our leadership as the world’s leading independent producer and distributor of content.

We plan to capitalize on our know-how as the world’s leading independent producer and distributor of
content to develop a dedicated entertainment business. We believe that our ambition to become an
integrated global leader in the production of live events will be supported by the Balich Acquisition,
pursuant to which we will gain access to Balich’s international network and existing expertise in
creating, producing and delivering live shows. Our German production company, Brainpool, will also
undergo a restructuring of its live events, agency and tour division under a new label focused on
comedy event and stand-up artists. We plan on leveraging our production and distribution network to


-----

unlock synergy value in the entertainment space, which we believe remains largely unconsolidated
and has a business model similar to that upon which the Group was built. Moving forward, we will
apply the same strategies in our entertainment business as we have in the past in our production and
distribution business to build our offering, relying on a mix of organic growth, synergies with the
other divisions of the Group and various selective, value-enhancing acquisitions, business
combinations and joint ventures.

**_Act as a Sustainable and Responsible Player at the Corporate and Production Levels_**

We aim to create an environment where employees can perform to the best of their abilities in an
inclusive work culture. We will continue to build diverse, supportive and collaborative teams, while
ensuring equal opportunities for our workforce, including through the development of our global
diversity and inclusion board and employee resource groups. We foster inclusion and promote
diversity both on- and off-screen through specialized partnerships to drive best practice and ensure
that we attract and retain talents who share our values and support our local communities. In addition
to our ongoing focus on diversity and inclusion, we plan to continue promoting and emphasizing
professional and ethical behavior in the workplace, while at the same time fostering a positive
physical and mental health environment through new initiatives guaranteeing the health and wellbeing of our employees, such as the training of mental health first-aiders and the inclusion of care
guidelines in all format bibles across all production companies. As part of our long-term growth plan,
we also intend to continue advocating a sustainability-led mindset to reduce our carbon footprint and
overall impact on the environment. We believe that our efforts towards becoming a carbon-neutral
producer are bolstered by our continued collaboration with specialist consultancy firms and local
industry-led initiatives such as 3Degrees and Ecoprod, as well as our active membership of the Albert
Consortium, which we use as a platform to incentivize the television and film production industry to
reduce its waste and carbon footprint.

**History**

The Group was established in 2007 by a team of experienced professionals led by Stéphane Courbit,
the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Endemol France. Mr. Courbit initially invested in
Banijay through his family holding company, LGI, and subsequently integrated other private investors
such as the Agnelli Family through Exor N.V., the Drago and Boroli families through DeA, Jean-Paul
Bize through AMS Industries and Bernard Arnault through Groupe Arnault S.E. The Group is
currently managed by Mr. Courbit, who serves as Chairman, and by Marco Bassetti, our Chief
Executive Officer.

Mr. Courbit created the Group in order to build a worldwide brand in the content production business,
mostly through acquisitions of key local television and digital content producers. We have acquired
several television production companies since our inception, attracting leading managers in the
television and entertainment industries, including through the completion of the Banijay Zodiak
Merger in 2016, and the Endemol Shine Acquisition in 2020. On July 1, 2022, the ordinary shares of
our indirect parent company, FLE, were successfully admitted to listing and trading on the Euronext
Amsterdam regulated market under the symbol “FL Entertainment” pursuant to FLE’s business
combination with Pegasus. Since 2018, we have also established several joint ventures in the United
Kingdom and the United States, the most active markets for international scripted shows.

**Our Operations**

We create and produce television formats, programs and digital content in 21 countries, and sell and
distribute such television formats, programs and digital content globally. We consider the operations
of all of our subsidiaries to be similar and thus classify our operations into the following two main
businesses:

- _Production Business: Our production business is focused on creating and developing original_
content (scripted and non-scripted) through our production companies based on our analysis of
trends in the industry and the needs of linear broadcasters, global streaming platforms such as


-----

Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max and other digital platforms. We benefit from the
creativity and expertise of all our talents. These talents are necessary in order to maintain our
policy to exclusively adapt our format catalogue through the Group’s global footprint via our
local production companies in the markets where we are present. In addition, we also acquire
licenses for formats owned by third parties in order to produce and license program based on
such formats to a broadcaster or a digital platform.

- _Distribution and Secondary Business: We generate revenues from the international distribution_
and licensing of intellectual property rights and merchandizing of successful formats and
programs. Our distribution business consists of licensing and distributing our portfolio of
formats and programs owned and/or controlled by the Group to traditional television channels,
local producers and digital platforms. We operate our distribution business primarily through
our subsidiary in the United Kingdom, Banijay Rights Limited.

The following graphic shows the main steps from developing a format to distribution and secondary
rights:

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated
€3,242 million and €3,212 million of total revenues, respectively, compared to €2,756 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021.

**_Production_**

We develop television programs both based on formats created in-house or by licensing formats from
third parties in order to meet the demands of linear broadcasters, global streaming platforms and other
digital platforms.

_Development of Formats_

The first step in our production process is to develop new concepts for television programming. Once
these concepts are developed and formalized, we refer to them as “formats” and maintain intellectual
property rights over such formats, when possible. A successful track record and creative reputation
are key to continuing to develop original formats. From time to time, we also license the right to
produce formats owned by third parties, rather than developed in-house by us, in order to address
popular consumer trends and the needs of broadcasters and digital platforms. We either continue to
develop these formats in-house or pitch them to broadcasters and digital platforms. We develop a
wide variety of formats in order to avoid exposure to a limited number of titles and to keep a
diversified portfolio of formats.

We classify our formats in two main genres: non-scripted and scripted. We have historically focused
on developing non-scripted formats, which benefit from lower production costs, a shorter
development period and more advantageous financing arrangements, because the broadcaster who
acquires rights in the non-scripted content typically funds the full production costs. Non-scripted
formats can generate significant secondary revenues because they can be licensed and produced in
several countries. For example, a game show or reality show can be adapted in many countries,
sometimes under different names but with an identical concept. For the year ended December 31,
2022, non-scripted content generated €2,134 million, or 80%, of our production revenues. On the
other hand, scripted formats require higher upfront development costs and often need to be coproduced by several parties. We have significantly expanded our scripted activity to meet our
customers’ and the market’s increasing demand for scripted content. We currently have companies
producing scripted programming in all 21 countries where we are present. Scripted programs can also
generate significant secondary revenues, especially if such programs are in English, because they have
more appeal be sold worldwide to broadcasters and to local or global digital platforms.


-----

We develop new formats in each of our geographic markets. Our local subsidiaries have their own
creative teams which work together with Creative Networks, our Group-level central content team.
Creative Networks facilitates the sharing of new and existing formats to local teams worldwide, keeps
such teams informed of market trends outside their own territories and supports the creation of
formats that address both local markets needs and global trends. If successful, these formats may be
licensed and used in different markets and via different platforms.

Non-scripted:

We develop original formats and programs in four principal non-scripted genres:

- _Entertainment and Talk Shows: Entertainment and talk shows mainly encompass entertainment_
formats and programs that are studio-based. We believe our most successful entertainment
programs include It’s Only TV!, MasterChef, All Together Now, Go, Beat the Star, Your Face
_Sounds Familiar, All Against 1, Fort Boyard, LEGO Masters, Blow up and Starstruck. For the_
year ended December 31, 2022, our entertainment content and talk shows generated €670
million in production revenues.

- _Reality: Reality includes television programs in which ordinary people are continuously filmed_
outside their usual environment, designed to be entertaining rather than informative. We believe
our most successful reality programs include _Big Brother, Big Brother VIP, The Challenge,_
_Paradise Hotel, Survivor, Temptation Island, Hunted, SAS Who Dares Wins, The Biggest Loser_
_Beauty and the Geek, Joe Millionaire and_ _Star Academy. For the year ended December 31,_
2022, our reality content programs generated €815 million in production revenues.

- _Factual Entertainment: Factual entertainment is a combination of factual/documentary and_
entertainment programs, focusing on social experiments and popular topics. We believe our
most successful factual entertainment programs include _The Secret Life of 4 Year Olds,_
_Location, Location, Location, Below Deck, Wife Swap, The Island, Ambulance, One Born Every_
_Minute, Home of the Year, Your Home Made Perfect and_ _How to Look Good Naked. For the_
year ended December 31, 2022, our factual entertainment content programs generated €372
million in production revenues.

- _Game Shows: Game shows are predominantly programs in which contestants compete for prizes_
during games of knowledge, physical challenges or by luck. We believe our most successful
game shows include Don’t Forget the Lyrics!, Limitless Win, Identity, Minute to Win It, Tipping
_Point, Deal or No Deal, Pointless, The Money Drop, The Wall and The Legacy. Game shows_
have significant potential for secondary format revenues because they are easily adaptable to
different local markets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our game show content
programs generated €189 million in production revenues.

Scripted:

Scripted programs include drama, docu-drama and scripted comedy. We believe our most successful
drama programs include international premium titles such as _Versailles, Peaky Blinders, Black_
_Mirror, The Bridge (Bron), Wallander, Occupied, Millennium, Grantchester, Good Karma Hospital,_
_Queens, Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS), Rogue Heroes and_ _Saint Tropez (Sous le soleil), as_
well as local daily drama programs such as _Family, Good Times Bad Times and_ _Ladies’ Paradise._
Formatted comedy series include Solsidan, Ladykracher and Pastewka. For the year ended December
31, 2022, our scripted content programs (excluding €14 million of kids’ programming) generated
€517 million in production revenues.

We aired more than 130 scripted titles during the year ended December 31, 2022, representing more
than 1,000 hours of content, spread over 20 different countries, half of which were new launches and
three quarters of which were non-English titles. Our network of scripted producers work with local
writers and directors to develop ideas and packages to pitch to local broadcasters. The development of
scripted programs usually includes a large part of script writing. Producers then work with
broadcasters to ensure they hire the right cast for local and international audiences. Once a scripted
show is formally approved, it enters into pre-production and preparation begins, and the filmed
program is then ended until delivered to the broadcaster.

_Sales and Commissioning to Broadcasters and Digital Platforms_

Once we have developed original formats in-house or acquired option rights to third-party formats, we
organize various presentations to pitch these formats to broadcasters and digital platforms. We usually
approach broadcasters and digital platforms with a detailed presentation and/or a trailer for nonscripted formats, but when we present a scripted format, our pitch consists of a logline, a synopsis and
a treatment. A logline is a one-sentence description of the show. A “synopsis” is a brief summary of
the show that includes information about the main characters and the theme of the show. A
“treatment” is a detailed description of the characters and the show’s plot. We also develop, in some
instances, a trailer or a full pilot for a television show.


-----

We provide broadcasters and digital platforms with detailed project timelines and budget plans for
production and negotiate with them to agree on the terms of their acquisition of rights to our
programs, particularly with respect to pricing and retaining intellectual property rights that will enable
us to generate secondary revenues across various platforms and distribute the program in other
regions. Key negotiation points include: (i) the duration of the license; (ii) the scope of rights granted
to digital platforms and broadcasters, such as free VOD services and ancillary rights; and (iii)
holdbacks and options for renewal. We use our combined resources across other production projects
and our expertise to propose competitive and lean production plans to broadcasters.

_Production Process_

Once a format has been developed and a project has been sold to a broadcaster or digital platform, we
begin the production process and produce a program based on such format. The process consists of
producing and filming the show, editing the content as well as choosing and, when possible,
publishing and producing the soundtrack. We operate a fully funded production model for the
majority of our programs whereby broadcasters and digital platforms commit upfront to fund the full
cost of the production and our production margin in exchange for their right to use the program within
the scope agreed with them. Occasionally, digital platforms or broadcasters only partially fund
production costs, with the remainder thereof financed either by tax credit and/or distribution advances.
If broadcasters pay us after we incur production costs, we may fund this shortfall through financing
arrangements or through our working capital. If we have longer cash flow shortfalls, in particular for
scripted projects, we aim for broadcasters to cover our financing costs. We often share the secondary
revenues with broadcasters and digital platforms, and, subject to market trends and our bargaining
power, all or part of the intellectual property rights to the format or the program may be assigned to
our clients. Digital platforms generally require the transfer of ownership over all rights to the formats
and programs that they finance, and we benefit from a share of modified adjusted gross receipts as
consideration for the secondary revenues generated by the formats and programs we produce. Strong
formats generally have high ratings, generate significant advertising revenues and/or provide for
additional subscriptions to the platforms of our clients.

We have implemented cost-efficient, flexible and scalable production processes throughout our
Group. For example, we use freelancers and lease production facilities in order to limit our investment
in fixed assets. We have also implemented strict cost control to deliver final programs on time and
respect customers’ budgets. Cost control is especially important for scripted programs which require
higher costs and longer production processes than non-scripted programs.

_Internal Circulation of Our Formats_

As an independent production group, one of our major strengths is our network of producers who
have exclusive access to our catalogue of formats in their respective geographic markets. This internal
feed of formats is key for our local Group companies. We prioritize the production of successful
formats in the markets in which we operate. Creative Networks builds and centralizes all the relevant
information and material on new formats and upcoming, promising titles circulated among our
production companies. For example, Temptation Island, Big Brother, Your Face Sounds Familiar, All
_together Now and Hunted are all successful formats developed by one of our production companies in_
a given market and subsequently produced by several of other local production companies in their
respective markets.

**_Distribution and Secondary Revenues_**

We aim to retain intellectual property rights to our formats and programs. These formats and
programs are assets that continue to generate secondary revenues through various channels, other than
the initial sale to a broadcaster or digital platform. We own all or part of the intellectual property
rights to a broad and diversified portfolio of existing formats and programs, for which distribution
rights are granted to Banijay Rights Limited. We distribute both (i) formats and programs produced
by us and (ii) formats and programs produced by third-party production companies in which we have
acquired intellectual property rights and for which we control the distribution. For the year ended


-----

December 31, 2022, formats and programs produced by third-party production companies represented
approximately 12% of our distribution business catalogue, based on the aggregate hours of content.
Through Banijay Rights limited, we have globally distributed scripted series which launched during
the year ended December 31, 2022, including French series Marie-Antoinette, which has sold in 146
territories, and UK series SAS Rogue Heroes, which has sold in 172 territories, in each case during
their first year. In addition, successful returning series such as _Peaky Blinders and_ _Grantchester_
continue to pursue their global rollout and were sold in 233 and 116 territories, respectively, during
the year ended December 31, 2022.

We distribute the content we own and license to a traditional customer base of linear broadcasters and
producers, as well as digital platforms. In the countries in which we do not operate, we license our
portfolio of formats to producers, who can acquire from Banijay Rights Limited an option to pitch our
formats to broadcasters, and to broadcasters and digital platforms. Once the format is commissioned
by such broadcaster, the licensee acquires a license of the format through a format license agreement
in order to produce a program based on such format and allow the broadcaster or digital platform to
air the program in accordance with the terms of the format license agreement. The licensees pay us an
option fee to be granted the right to pitch the format and a format fee upon signing of the format
license agreement once a commission is confirmed. In consideration of such format fee, the licensees
are allowed to produce a program based on our format and to air it in their local territory for a certain
period of time.

_Distribution of Programs to Broadcasters_

We distribute our portfolio of television programs directly to linear broadcasters, basic and premium
cable networks, and international pay-television distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2022,
sales of programs (in the form of finished tapes) to customers represented 72% of our distribution
revenues. The broadcasters pay us a license fee in return for the right to air a program across a given
period of time and for a given number of runs. Banijay Rights Limited receives a commission on that
license fee for its distribution activity, and the remainder of the license fee is paid to the owner of the
program (i.e., either our local production company owning the intellectual property rights or the thirdparty owner of the intellectual property rights).

_Distribution of Programs to Digital Platforms_

We distribute our portfolio of television program titles to digital platforms, including SVOD providers
such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Discovery+, HBO Max, Paramount+, Peacock, and
AVOD platforms such as Globo, Pluto and Freevee. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 34% of
our distribution revenues were generated through the sales of our portfolio of programs licensed to
VOD platforms such as Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video and Netflix and other revenues allocated to
additional digital platforms (mainly SVOD rights).

In the United States and, to a lesser extent, Europe and other markets such as India and Latin
America, consumers, and in particular younger demographics, are viewing more content on more
devices and through SVOD or AVOD platforms, such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and
Roku. SVOD requires consumers to enter into a subscription contract giving the consumer access to
content, including exclusive content, from the digital platform. In the United States, SVOD services
have increased the value of our catalogue series and movies due to increased viewership by
consumers and the correlating demand and spending by digital platforms. Netflix, for example,
reported that it had spent approximately $17 billion in acquiring content for the year ended December
31, 2022. Although these investments are primarily made in the United States and in Englishlanguage content, the European market is gaining an increasing amount of traction with U.S.-based
streaming platforms, which are expanding globally. As a global independent producer with a proven
track record of producing and distributing long-lasting and travelling content (through local versions
of some of the world’s biggest titles as well as original territorial content in local languages), we
believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends, and efficiently monetize our content
across all platforms through our “360-degree” strategy.


-----

As of December 31, 2022, we had license agreements with most of the main digital platforms and aim
to further expand our agreements with them. These customers, such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix,
Discovery+, Paramount+ and HBO Max, display our content on their platforms. Our partnerships
allow subscribers of the relevant networks to access our programs across a variety of devices. As of
December 31, 2022, there were approximately 1.6 billion of OTT subscribers worldwide, most of
whom had access to our content through our partnerships with the aforementioned customers. Netflix
alone accounted for 231 million subscribers and Disney for 235 million (including Disney+, Hulu and
ESPN+) subscribers, in each case as of December 31, 2022.

_Other Secondary Revenues_

Other secondary revenues include revenues from commercial activities related to our formats, such as
merchandizing, sponsorships, licensing, gaming, music and live events. Other secondary revenues
complement revenues from the initial sale to broadcasters and digital platforms and our distribution
revenues. Following the Balich Acquisition, we plan to capitalize on our know-how as the world’s
leading independent producer and distributor of content to develop a dedicated entertainment business
and therefore increase our secondary revenues.

**Our Markets and Production Companies**

We derive revenues from our operations in the 21 countries in which we manage our production
labels through a decentralized structure. This structure incentivizes our local managers and partners to
grow their respective brand in their respective markets. In addition, Banijay Kids & Family is our
dedicated production, distribution and sales division for children’s programming worldwide.

**_France_**

We are the largest independent television content producer in France for the year ended December 31,
2022 in terms of hours of content. We generated 9% of our total revenues in France for the year ended
December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had 21 main production labels in France:

Southfields, NL Film, Endemol Shine Nederland, SimpelZodiak, TVBV, Scenery, Topkapi and

and Endemol Shine Asia.

December 31, 2022, with two main production labels as of December 31, 2022: Endemol Shine

**Our Competition**

Our businesses operate in highly competitive industries and different competitive factors apply in
each segment of our operations. The following graphic shows the revenues and catalogue depth of the
producers that we consider to be our main competitors:

______________

(1) Represents data as of December 31, 2022 for Banijay, and latest available market data for other players.

(2) Excludes major U.S. studios such as Disney and Warner Brothers, as well as independent players such as MGM and Lionsgate.

**_Production_**

The content production market is fragmented both in Europe and in the United States. Recent
acquisitions of independent producers by large media companies seeking vertical integration or by
larger independent production groups illustrate the strategic importance of geographical presence and
access to content such as Sony Pictures Television’s acquisition of Industrial Media. Acquisitions
enable market players to increase their content library and distribution capabilities and expand to
different countries and distribution channels. Ongoing market consolidation has led to the creation of
a few large international television production and distribution groups, including our biggest
competitors, such as Lionsgate, Fremantle, Red Arrow Studios, All3Media, BBC Studios, ITV
Studios and Mediawan, each of which provide their local production companies with exclusive access
to their catalogues. Our competitive position is greatly affected by the quality of, and public response
to, our content. We also compete with other production companies and studios for the services of
creative talents, producers, directors, writers, actors and others and for the acquisition of intellectual
property.

**_Distribution_**

We also face competition with other studios, television production groups and independent producers
for the licensing and distribution of our formats and programs. New opportunities in the production


-----

and distribution business have emerged due to the growing demand for new content. Audience
fragmentation has increased due to the rise of digital platforms, both global, such as Netflix, Amazon
Prime Video, Disney+, Discovery+ or Paramount+, and regional, such as Viaplay in Northern Europe,
Britbox in the United Kingdom and Hulu and Peacock in the United States. The portfolio of potential
customers is increasing as are the opportunities for production, distribution and for secondary rights
revenue generation. The AVOD market is also rapidly growing and represents new secondary window
exploitation opportunities for our content. Banijay Rights Limited operates its own FAST channels,
which are syndicated on several platforms such as Pluto or Freevee. We also compete with other
forms of entertainment and leisure, including other television networks, premium pay-television
services, local over-the-air television stations, OTT services, motion pictures, home entertainment
products and services, video games, print media, live events, radio broadcasts and other forms of
news, information and entertainment, as well as pirated content.

**Marketing and Sales**

Each of our production companies, via our subsidiaries, develops its own marketing and sales
strategies independently to address the local needs of broadcasters. Our central content team, Creative
Networks, focuses on increasing the international appeal of our formats and programs and partners
with Banijay Rights Limited to market content in other countries in order to export successful formats
into new markets. Local production teams work in close collaboration with our central content team to
provide all the marketing materials needed (for example, sales video trailers or presentations) to
promote content internationally. Our distribution business promotes our formats and programs in
various international and regional markets at events such as MIPCOM, London Screenings, C21
Content London, Series Mania, NATPE Miami and Budapest, Berlinale and Sundance.

**Our Customers**

We work with a broad network of customers and partners, including broadcasters, television channels,
producers and digital platforms active in the markets in which we operate, as well as with licensees,
retailers of consumer products and commercial partners from around the world. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, we distributed and licensed the content we own and control through our
subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited, to approximately 1,050 licensees. Our main production customers
include broadcasters such as France Télévisions, TF1 Group, ITV, the BBC, Channel 4 Television,
FOX, CBS, Bravo, Antena 3, TVE, Channel 5, RTL Group, TV2 Denmark, NENT, DR Denmark,
TV4 Sweden, SKY, Mediaset, Rai Uno, Canal Plus Group, ABC Network, NBC, Discovery and
MTV, as well as global OTT players, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Discovery+, Disney+,
Paramount+, Peacock and HBO Max. For the year ended December 31, 2022, (i) our top eight
broadcasters accounted for 43% of our production revenues, and no single broadcaster accounted for
more than 12% of our production revenues, and (ii) our top ten distribution customers accounted for
14% of our distribution revenues, and no single distribution customer accounted for more than 7% of
our production revenues.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,084 full-time employees, compared to 2,791 employees as of
December 31, 2021. We also use the services of a significant number of freelance production artists
and technicians. This number varies from time to time depending, in part, on the level of television
production activity in which we are engaged. The following table sets forth our full-time employees
by country as of December 31, 2022:

In connection with the acquisition of production companies in various jurisdictions, we have entered
into, and continue to enter into, earn-out or put option agreements with certain managers and creative
talents of these companies in order to incentivize them to continue to work with us following the
relevant acquisition. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” In addition, our
management has implemented a long-term incentive plan to ensure the commitment of local
management teams by rewarding key personnel based on their respective contribution to the value
creation of their entity and that of the Group. Our compensation and bonus structure is reviewed
annually to ensure that we remain competitive, and was harmonized across the Group in 2021
following the completion of the Endemol Shine Acquisition. We also contribute to pension plans and
other post-employment benefits as required by local law or on a non-mandatory basis.

Many of our employees, including writers, producers and technical and production personnel, as well
as some of our on-air and creative talents, are subject to collective bargaining agreements. As of
December 31, 2022, 3.7% of our total workforce was covered by collective Group-specific bargaining
agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no active strikes or work stoppages,
and we believe that our relations with our union and non-union employees are good.

**Intellectual Property**

Our intellectual property assets principally include copyrights in our formats and programs, filmed
entertainment and other content, trademarks and service marks in brand names, trade names and logos
and domain names, as well as licenses to use other intellectual property rights and licenses of our
intellectual property to others. Our proprietary content constitutes a significant part of the Group’s
value, and the protection of our brands and content is important. To protect our intellectual property
rights, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and
domain name laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements. Approximately 51% and 52% of our
production revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, came from our
owned intellectual property.


-----

We seek to limit challenges to our intellectual property rights, especially with respect to rights to our
formats, which are more difficult to protect and which may lead to significant legal fees if a dispute
becomes transnational. We monitor trademark registrations and relevant third-party productions to
ensure there is no copyright infringement of our proprietary content. By involving our legal team in
all material intellectual property litigation across the Group, we are able to ensure consistency in our
claims and defenses.

**Information Technology**

Our business depends on the successful operation of information systems and other standard
technology. To this end, we have established two creative business platforms: Blink and Core. Blink
is our internal content platform and provides information and links to assets on our library of formats,
news on the Group and access to internal documents such as trends presentations, policies and internal
communication on events held by the Group, as well as information and market intelligence on
competition programming. Core is our online platform tracking the development, production and onair activity of our content. In addition to Blink and Core, we also use B-Learning, a platform licensed
from MetaCompliance, for Group-wide e-training (for example, on cyber security and compliance)
and policy management. Our IT security is decentralized. As a result, our regional headquarters and
production labels are responsible for implementing our IT security governance framework, which
follows the ISO 21000 industry standards and remains centrally monitored.

**Property**

In order to limit our fixed costs, we generally prefer to lease properties and production facilities that
we use for our production business. In certain countries, such as the United States, Spain and
Germany, our subsidiaries own studios or production equipment and lease it to other entities either
within the Group or to third parties.

**Quality Management**

We maintain a stringent quality assurance program to ensure the quality of our formats and programs.
To this end, we conduct regular employee training and perform regular audits at each of our
subsidiaries, employing several professionals active in auditing and improving the quality assurance
of our operations.

**Insurance**

We have property, directors’ and officers’, key man, workers’ compensation and other specific
production insurance coverage in place to the extent that it is legally required and that we believe it to
be appropriate for operating our business. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will not incur losses
beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies. In addition, longer interruptions of
business at one or more of our studios can, even if insured, result in the loss of sales, profit, customers
and market share.

**ESG**

We aim to create an environment where employees can perform to the best of their abilities in an
inclusive work culture. Our employees come from a broad range of backgrounds, and we strive to
build diverse, supportive and collaborative teams, while ensuring equal opportunities for our
workforce. We have significantly scaled up our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts since 2021, with
the implementation of a global diversity and inclusion board and employee resource groups to foster
inclusion and promote diversity across the entire Group. Our global diversity and inclusion board is
comprised of 21 members with appropriate seniority and experience to drive change among senior
management and employees across the entire Group, with a focus on improving diversity, launching
new educational initiatives and specialized partnerships to drive best practice and broaden our talent
pool, and attracting and retaining talents who share our values and support our local communities.


-----

We seek to achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations, and believe that we are currently in compliance with all such applicable laws
and regulations. We are focused on creating a safe working environment via a code of conduct and
welfare policies, and have also implemented several initiatives to guarantee the health and well-being
of our employees, such as the training of mental health first-aiders and the inclusion of care guidelines
in all format bibles across all production companies. In addition, we have also established a 24/7
hotline that is available to our employees via a secure website and offers them the opportunity to raise
concerns about potential issues on topics such as bullying, harassment and discrimination in general.
We place significant emphasis on the importance of maintaining professional and ethical behavior in
the workplace, while at the same time promoting a positive physical and mental health environment.

We also have a sustainability-led mindset to reduce our carbon footprint and overall impact on the
environment. In connection therewith, we signed a partnership with a specialist consultancy firm,
3Degrees, to craft a carbon measurement system for use across the Group, which has already been
fully rolled out in the United Kingdom and the United States. The measurement system is intended to
be used in coordination with local industry-led initiatives such as Ecoprod. In the United Kingdom,
we are a member of the Albert Consortium, an environmental organization that incentivizes the
television and film production industry to reduce its waste and carbon footprint, and our UK
production companies follow the organization’s certification process. Similarly, in France, Ecoprod
contributes to training our professionals and raising awareness to help instill a sustainability-led
mindset. In addition, Creative Networks, our Group-level central content team, provides green
guidance in connection with our educational initiatives.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, we are party to a variety of claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary
course of our business. We do not expect the final disposition of these matters to have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. We have insurance and
reserves to cover self-insured retentions for any material adverse outcomes in most claims. For claims
in which insurance coverage may not be available, we have established reserves deemed to cover
possible adverse outcomes and related fees. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all
pending suits and claims, the ultimate resolution of these matters or of future lawsuits could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position or reputation.

**_Dropped_**

_Dropped is a format where two teams of athletes or former athletes are dropped in a remote location_
by helicopter and have to make their way back to civilization without a map or a compass as quickly
as possible. We developed this format into a successful program in Sweden and Norway where it
aired in 2014 and 2015. At the end of 2014, we began to develop the format for a program in France
through our subsidiary, Adventure Line Productions (“ALP”), with Argentina chosen as the location
for the first series. ALP had subcontracted the logistics of the show to a specialized company, SAX
Logistica (“SAX”). On March 9, 2015, two helicopters took off from Villa Catelli (La Rioja province)
in Argentina carrying three contestants (renowned yachtswoman Florence Arthaud, Olympic
champion swimmer Camille Muffat and Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine) and five employees of ALP.
The helicopters collided with each other shortly after take off causing the deaths of all the passengers
onboard each helicopter and the two pilots.

Following the crash, two investigations were initiated: (i) an investigation under the direction of an
Argentinean federal court (whereby ALP is a witness) and (ii) a judicial investigation in France.
Following a hearing in February 2021, the French judges decided to change ALP’s status from an
assisted witness (“témoin assisté”) to under investigation (“mis en examen”). As of the date of this
offering memorandum, the criminal investigations in Argentina and France are still ongoing. In
addition to ALP, the two former executives of ALP, the director of ALP’s productions and the
director of Dropped, who were in function at the time of the accident, have also been indicted. The
French investigating judges have issued a notice of termination of the investigation (“avis de fin


-----

_d’information”), following which ALP had until March 15, 2023 to file requests to dismiss the case._
This request to dismiss is currently under review.

The families of the five deceased ALP employees have initiated separate civil actions against ALP,
requesting aggregate damages of approximately €4 million. Two of these claims have been deferred
or suspended, either in the first instance or by a court of appeal, until completion of the criminal
investigation. In the other three claims, ALP was held liable in the first instance, and appealed such
decisions. In two of these appeals, ALP’s conviction was upheld, and ALP subsequently appealed to
the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which proceedings are still pending. The third appeal
is currently under review. In all of these proceedings, the families are asking that ALP pays an
increased amount for the pensions granted to them by the relevant health insurance funds. In addition,
the families of two of the three deceased athletes have filed civil claims against ALP for damages,
with one claim amounting to €4.2 million, and the other family still appraising damages incurred.
Both cases have been deferred until the completion of the criminal proceedings or until further actions
from the plaintiffs. The family of the third athlete is a civil party in the criminal proceedings and will
likely seek compensation via this avenue.

Our production risks insurer, Liberty Syndicates Management Ltd. (“LSM”), paid €2.1 million to
ALP in connection with the accident. LSM then filed a civil claim against SAX, which was rejected
by the Commercial Court of Paris. LSM appealed this decision in July 2019 and in September 2021,
the Paris Court of Appeal reversed the first instance judgment and ordered SAX to pay LSM €2.1
million. SAX’s appeal to the French Cour de cassation is currently pending.

Separately, ALP has also filed a lawsuit against AXA based on our professional liability insurance for
any potential damages (subject to insurance limitations and exclusions) awarded to the families of the
victims in connection with the pending civil actions. In September 2019, this case was deferred until
completion of the criminal investigation. An order of the French pre-trial judge dated September 6,
2022 denied ALP’s request to revoke the stay of proceedings on the basis that no conviction was yet
final.

**_Endemol Shine India_**

Following the completion of the Endemol Shine Acquisition, a change of control put option was
triggered under the shareholders’ agreement of Endemol Private India Limited (“ES India”) to the
benefit of CA Media Mauritius Holding (“CA Media”), the minority shareholder of ES India.
Pursuant to this put option, Endemol Shine OpCo Holding was to acquire CA Media’s 49% stake of
the share capital in ES India at fair market value. As CA Media sought specific performance by
Endemol Shine Opco Holding of its obligations under this put option, including the payment of
interest, a dispute arose in connection with the valuation of CA Media’s shares in ES India. An
arbitral award was issued in Singapore in February 2023, ordering Endemol Shine OpCo Holding,
which has since been merged into Banijay Benelux Holding B.V., to pay CA Media approximately
€65 million in exchange for its shares in ES India. The payment was made by Banijay Benelux
Holding B.V. in July 2023, pursuant to which the ownership of the remaining shares in ES India was
transferred from CA Media to Banijay Benelux Holding B.V.

**_Koh Lanta_**

In 2013, a participant in Koh Lanta (the French version of Survivor), a reality program we produce in
France through ALP, died as a result of a heart attack during the filming of the program. Following
his death, a French court opened a criminal investigation regarding the involuntary manslaughter of
the participant. It has since been established that the participant suffered from a pre-existing heart
condition. While the family and heirs of the participant have not initiated any civil proceedings, the
criminal investigation is still pending. We expect the court to drop the case but are not a party to the
investigation and therefore do not have access to court documents. Based on the information received
to date, we will continue to argue that the death of the participant was the result of natural causes and
that our production company was not in any way responsible.


-----

**_Zodiak Belgium_**

In 2019, Zodiak Belgium initiated criminal proceedings against, among others, its former Chief
Financial Officer and former Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, on the basis of
unlawful practices within Zodiak Belgium. Such practices involved the creation of fraudulent invoices
to companies owned by, or otherwise related to, the former Chief Financial Officer, cash withdrawals,
cash payments to employees and certain third parties, fictitious expense notes and fictitious invoices
to foreign companies, amounting to approximately €11 million over the course of eight years. In
March 2019, Zodiak Belgium terminated its agreements with the former Chief Financial Officer and
former Chief Executive Officer, which the Chief Financial Officer has challenged before a
commercial court. The former Chief Executive Officer has paid €140,000 as compensation for cash he
received. Zodiak Belgium is also seeking, as part of its criminal claim, the reimbursement by its
former Chief Financial Officer of all amounts improperly disbursed by him or certain related parties.
Following the results of this investigation, we have also focused on improving our internal
compliance and control mechanisms at our production companies. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to Our Business—Our success is dependent, in part, upon the integrity of our management and_
_employees, and our risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect violations of_
_law.” The criminal hearing has been scheduled for October 2023._

**_Endemol Shine Turkey_**

In 2017, external advisors of Endemol Shine concluded that Endemol Medya Prodüksiyon Tic. Ltd.
Şti. (“Endemol Shine Turkey”) was insolvent as its liabilities exceeded its assets and it was no longer
able to pay its debts as they fell due. It was also determined that management at Endemol Shine
Turkey obtained unauthorized loans and issued several checks in contravention of Endemol Shine’s
governance policies.

In May and June 2017, two members of the local management team implicated in the aforementioned
mismanagement were dismissed. On June 30, 2017, the shareholders of Endemol Shine Turkey filed
for bankruptcy with the Turkish court. In addition, creditors have filed various claims against
Endemol Shine Turkey. In January 2020, the court announced the dismissal of the bankruptcy
application of Endemol Shine Turkey. Such determination was subject to two expert financial reports
produced by a panel of financial and sectoral experts delivered to the court in 2019. At the January
2020 hearing, the court also decided that the court-appointed managing administrations who were
authorized to carry out “urgent and financial” matters on behalf of Endemol Shine Turkey would
remain in charge until the decision became definite. The managing administrators were originally
appointed by the court in October 2017 as “audit administrators” to independently audit any
payments, expenses, money transfers and assignments made by Endemol Shine Turkey. Endemol
Shine Turkey filed an appeal in June 2020 against the decision rejecting the insolvency. In 2021, the
court rejected the appeal, and in September 2022, the court of appeal upheld the decisions and
rejected the bankruptcy claim. As a result, the managing administrators are no longer in charge of
Endemol Shine Turkey. Endemol Shine Turkey has appointed a support manager to manage the dayto-day affairs of the company and assist in its closing. The exposure of the third-party creditors is
currently estimated to be approximately $5 million.

Further, Endemol Shine Turkey has entered into three settlement agreements with tax authorities: two
for unpaid tax debts and one for the unpaid social security premium payments. There are no written
agreements for these settlements, as the arrangements are made through the online system of the
authorities.

The implicated members of management have initiated labor lawsuits against Endemol Shine Turkey
alleging wrongful termination of their employment contracts, which are still pending. Endemol Shine
has initiated separate criminal and civil proceedings against former management, which proceedings
are continuing. In addition, a number of third-party criminal proceedings have been brought against
Endemol Shine Turkey’s representatives in connection with post-dated checks issued by former
managers during such former managers’ employment, all of which have been dismissed to date with


-----

one remaining subject to an appeal. Finally, the creative team of the Broken Pieces series and movies
formerly produced by Endemol Shine Turkey has initiated two lawsuits seeking the suspension of the
sales of Broken Pieces and compensation from the former sales based on their alleged receivables.

**_Wipeout_**

In November 2020, a contestant on Wipeout passed away after participating in the show. After
running the obstacle course, the contestant received medical aid and was transported to the hospital,
after which he passed away. On December 2, 2020, a letter notified Endemol Shine North America of
an upcoming wrongful death action by the contestant’s family and requested the preservation of
evidence.

**_Endemol Shine Beyond_**

In 2020, two claimants alleged that they were sexually harassed and threatened with retaliation by a
former employee of Endemol Shine Beyond (a former division of Endemol Shine North America) in
2016 and 2017. The claimants proposed a settlement in February 2021, and parties subsequently
agreed to a mediation, which took place in June 2021. No settlement was reached, and the claimants
subsequently filed a lawsuit in January 2022. In February 2023, their claims were dismissed without
leave to amend based on the statute of limitations. The defendant’s demurrer was denied on the
remaining claim and it was determined that the claim would be better considered for dismissal at the
summary judgement stage after further discovery.

**Regulation**

The key regulation applicable to our business in Europe is Directive 2010/13/EU (as amended by
Directive 2018/1808/EU, the “Audiovisual Media Services Directive”), which requires that a certain
portion of the programs linear broadcasters air (excluding sports, news, events, games, advertising,
teletext services and teleshopping) be produced by European producers and that at least 10% of their
broadcasting time or 10% of their programming budget be dedicated to European content produced by
independent producers. Directive 2018/1808/EU extended the scope of the Audiovisual Media
Services Directive with specific measures for video sharing platforms and social networks, as well as
livestreaming platforms. The Audiovisual Media Services Directive also requires that 30% of the
catalogues of audiovisual on-demand media services are created in Europe and the application of
Member States’ rules to financial contributions from broadcasters and OTT platforms. Based on the
definition of independent producer in each relevant Member State, we are independent with respect to
all major broadcasters in Europe except for Canal Plus in France, and 30% of our catalogue of
audiovisual on-demand media services include European content. There are no similar regulations in
the countries outside Europe in which we operate, but other jurisdictions such as Australia are
considering implementing rules to protect producers vis-à-vis streamers. European Member States had
until September 19, 2020 to implement Directive 2018/1808/EU, and all European jurisdictions in
which we are active have either started or completed its transposition.

In addition to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, certain Member States have put in place
more protective measures in favor of European producers, including with regards to investment
obligations for broadcasters and streamers, the promotion of local-language and territorial content,
and the retention of intellectual property rights. For example, in France, the dispositions of the
Audiovisual Media Services Directive introduced by Directive 2018/ 1808/EU were transposed into
domestic legislation via ordinance 2020-1642 dated as of December 21, 2020 and decree 2021-793
dated as of June 22, 2021. Decree 2021-793 sets out the rules applicable to VOD services in
connection with (i) the contribution to the development of audiovisual production and (ii) the
promotion of European and original French-language audiovisual content, subject to specific
agreements entered into between certain VOD services and the French regulator. Decree 2021-793
also reduces the scope of rights granted to the VOD services in order for content to be included in the
quotas that broadcasters and streamers have to respect, and pursuant to which they must air and
contribute to specific independent producers.


-----

Since leaving the European Union, the United Kingdom is no longer a party to the Audiovisual Media
Services Directive and is considered a “third country” under the terms thereof. However, most
provisions of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive were implemented into English law under the
Audio Visual Media Services Regulations 2020, and the UK remains a party to the Council of
Europe’s European Convention of Transfrontier Television (“ECTT”), which ensures freedom of
reception of broadcasts between the United Kingdom and other ECTT countries. UK content is
therefore still considered as European for the purpose of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive
quotas. UK producers also benefit from the Communications Act 2003, pursuant to which public
service broadcasters in the United Kingdom have to secure a minimum of 25% of their qualifying
programming in each year for independent producers in order to receive a license to broadcast from
the Office of Communications, the government-approved regulatory and competition authority for the
broadcasting and telecommunications industries. In addition, certain broadcasters in the United
Kingdom can only produce in-house content within a limited framework or, in some instances, not at
all.

The other specific regulations applicable to our business are employment-related regulations,
including regulations governing unions and guilds that can materially impact the production cost of
programs and the secondary revenues generated by such programs (for example, minimum wages,
limitations on number of working days/hours and payment of residuals). Specific regulations may also
apply to certain productions (for example, children or animals participating in programs, health and
safety rules, product placement rules and rules governing the use of monuments or art). In addition,
subsidy contracts often contain terms that proscribe, among others, our ability to incur certain
expenses in the underlying geography related to the relevant production and/or post-production.

**Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement**

The Issuer on February 7, 2020 entered into a senior secured credit facilities agreement with, among
others, U.S. Bank National Association as agent, the Security Agent, Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch, Natixis, Société Générale, BNP Paribas S.A. and Bank of America Designated Activity
Company as mandated lead arrangers, as amended and restated on December 29, 2021 pursuant to an
amendment and restatement agreement (the “Original Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement”).

The Original Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provided for (i) senior term loan facilities in
principal amounts of €453.0 million (“Original EUR Term Loan B”) and €415.9 (equivalent) million
to be denominated in U.S. dollars (“Original USD Term Loan B”) and (ii) a revolving credit facility in
a principal amount of €170.0 million (equivalent) (the “Original Revolving Credit Facility”) (the
Original EUR Term Loan B, the Original USD Term Loan B and the Original Revolving Credit
Facility being collectively referred to as the “Existing Senior Credit Facilities” for the purposes of this
description).

On April 25, 2023, certain third party lenders made available to the Issuer the EUR Term Loan B1,
the USD Term Loan B1 and the Revolving Credit Facility (the EUR Term Loan B1, the USD Term
Loan B1 and the Revolving Credit Facility are collectively referred to as the “Senior Credit Facilities”
for the purposes of this description) in order to, amongst other things, refinance the Existing Senior
Credit Facilities.

On April 25, 2023, the Original Senior Secured Credit Facilities was amended and restated pursuant
to an amendment and restatement agreement in order, _inter alios, incorporate certain amendments_
following the utilisation of the Senior Credit Facilities (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement”).

On the date of first utilization, the applicable margins for borrowings under the Senior Credit
Facilities are: 4.50% per annum for the EUR Term Loan B1 (over EURIBOR, subject to a 0% floor),
3.75% per annum for the USD Term Loan B1 (over Term SOFR, subject to a 1% floor and a credit
adjustment spread of 0.10%), 3.75% per annum for any utilisation of the Revolving Credit Facility in
euro (over EURIBOR, subject to a 0% floor) and 4.00% for any utilisation of the Revolving Credit
Facility in U.S. dollars or sterling (over Term SOFR or compounded SONIA (as applicable) subject,
in each case, to a 0% floor). The margins under the Senior Credit Facilities are subject to adjustments
based on the satisfaction of certain conditions (including the achievement of specified levels of
“Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio” (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement)).
The EUR Term Loan B1 and USD Term Loan B1 were utilized in full on April 25, 2023.

A €20.0 million drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility was made in August 2023.

In addition to the EUR Term Loan B1, the USD Term Loan B1 and the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement includes (in addition to other permissions under the
limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability (without double counting against the limitation on
indebtedness covenant) to incur additional indebtedness by way of one or more uncommitted
additional facilities within the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) (the “Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio”).


-----

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under
EUR Term Loan B1 or the Revolving Credit Facility (as applicable). If Term SOFR is less than (i) 1%
for any loans under USD Term Loan B1, Term SOFR shall be deemed to be 1% in respect of loans
made under the USD Term Loan B1 or (ii) zero for loans denominated in U.S. dollars under the
Revolving Credit Facility, Term SOFR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of such loans made
under the Revolving Credit Facility. If the daily rate to calculate compounded SONIA as calculated as
described in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement is less than zero, such daily rate shall be
deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility denominated in
sterling.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from April 25, 2023 to the end of the availability period applicable to the Revolving
Credit Facility at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility.
Commitment fees will be payable quarterly in arrears and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is
cancelled in full or on the date on which the relevant lender cancels its commitment.

Any letter of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be subject to such issuing bank
and fronting fees as may be agreed between the relevant borrower and the applicable issuing bank and
a letter of credit fee equal to the margin that would have been applicable to a cash draw under the
Revolving Credit Facility in the applicable currency.

Default interest will accrue on overdue principal amounts at a rate equal to 1.00% per annum in
excess of the then applicable interest rate.

**_Repayments_**

The loans made under EUR Term Loan B1 and USD Term Loan B1 will be repaid in full on the
earlier of (i) March 1, 2028; (ii) the date falling 3 months prior to the earliest maturity of any
outstanding Existing Senior Notes or, in the event that the Existing Senior Notes are redeemed or
refinanced in full pursuant to one or more refinancing or redemption of all or a portion of the Existing
Senior Notes, the date falling 3 months prior to the earliest maturity date of any indebtedness made
available as part of any such refinancing or redemption; and (iii) the date falling 3 months prior to the

In respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest
period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under
the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on its maturity date. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on
loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

**_Voluntary and Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will permit voluntary prepayments to be made
(subject to de minimis amounts) and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain
circumstances, including:

(i) on an initial public offering which does not constitute a change of control (with the percentage
of proceeds to be prepaid subject to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio) (a “Listing
Prepayment”);

(ii) from certain net cash proceeds received by the Senior Secured Group from certain asset
disposals, insurance and recovery claims, to the extent not otherwise applied for a permitted
purpose and required to be applied in prepayment of the Senior Credit Facilities and subject to a
de minimis amount; and

Agreement, for each financial year (commencing with the financial year ending 31 December


-----

2020), a percentage of excess cash flow in the event that excess cash flow exceeds a minimum
threshold amount, which percentage decreases as the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
decreases (an “Excess Cash Flow Prepayment”).

Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement), each lender shall be entitled to require prepayment of its commitments within a
prescribed time period. A change of control shall include:

(iv) any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the voting power of
the Issuer other than in connection with a transaction or series of transactions in which the Issuer
shall become the wholly owned subsidiary of a parent entity (as defined in the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement) subject to certain conditions;

(v) Banijay ceasing to directly own and control 100% of the issued voting share capital of the
Issuer; and

(vi) on a disposal of substantially all the business of the Senior Secured Group.

At the election of the Issuer, amounts required to be prepaid pursuant to a Listing Prepayment or an
Excess Cash Flow Prepayment may instead be applied in repayment of any other Senior Secured
Indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) of the Senior Secured
Group provided that such amounts are applied in pro rata repayment of the EUR Term Loan B1 and
the USD Term Loan B1.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer,
Banijay, the Guarantors and the Trustee are party to an Intercreditor Agreement between, among

Banijay, the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a

instruments issued or to be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has been made

repayment, purchase or other discharge of any Secured Liabilities not prohibited by
the Intercreditor Agreement; or

c. as otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

No security (other than pursuant to the secured documents relating to Topco Independent Transaction
Security or Topco Shared Security or as described above) shall be granted by a member of the Senior
Secured Group in respect of any Topco Liabilities.

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of
existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes
of the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash
Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities,
Super Senior Liabilities or _Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The_
conditions include certification by the Issuer that such New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the
terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, setoff, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing


-----

arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any
New Debt Financing, each agent in respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent
(and each other person party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction
Security document) is authorized and instructed to enter promptly into any new security document,
amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or release any asset from the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) subject to
certain conditions, including as regards the terms of such security (which shall be, unless otherwise
agreed by the Issuer or otherwise required by the Issuer (other than if in relation to existing
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security that is being amended or released
and retaken), substantially the same as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the
Finance Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its
subsidiaries who, after the Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or
is otherwise combined with a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of or shares (or other
ownership interests) in any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the Closing Date
(together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions
to the incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been
satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic testing) shall be
permitted to subsist and there is no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee,
indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be given by any member of the Topco Group
in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or
Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or
exempt from being given under the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement), (ii) over any asset required (including subject to any condition) to
provide credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of
any obligation to extend any Transaction Security rateably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired
Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss is prevented by the documentation relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or
would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation but not including any obligation to
extend any Transaction Security rateably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness)
under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and Cash Management Facility
Liabilities (together with the Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,” the
creditors in respect thereof being the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time, provided that following
certain acceleration events under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, any Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Notes Indenture or Permitted Super Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency events in relation to a member of the
Senior Secured Group, payments may only be made by Debtors or Third Party Security Providers and
received by creditors in accordance with the provisions described below under “—Application of
_Proceeds” provided that after the Designation Date there shall be no obligation to turnover any such_
payments received, other than those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed
Disposal (as defined below) of assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following
an acceleration event as required by the ICA shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of default
under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.


-----

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second
Lien Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the
“Senior Secured Discharge Date”), the Issuer, the members of the Senior Secured Group and Third
Party Security Providers may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien
Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject
to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized
interest) is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior
Secured Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to
permit it), no payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien
Liabilities and no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than
principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility
document or Senior Secured Notes document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times,
notwithstanding that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing.
These payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities
in (ii) of the next paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the
“Second Lien Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the
“Priority Discharge Date”), the Issuer, Topco Borrowers, Third Party Security Providers and other
members of the Senior Secured Group may only make specified scheduled payments (including any
other direct or indirect step, matter, action or dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities otherwise
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement) under the Topco Liabilities or under any Topco
Proceeds Loan (together the “Topco Group Liabilities”) to the Topco Creditors or any Topco
Borrower or any holding company of the Issuer or other lender in respect of a Topco Proceeds Loan
(in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) (such payments, collectively, “Permitted
Topco Payments”):

(i) if:

(A) no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(B) no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than
principal, interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Cash Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document (a
“Senior Secured Payment Default”), or under the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien
Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the
Topco Liabilities which is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in
respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required
consents to permit such payment have been obtained, (2) any other amount which is not an
amount of principal or capitalized interest (such other amounts including all scheduled
interest payments (including, if applicable, special interest (or liquidated damages))) and
default interest on the Topco Liabilities accrued and payable in accordance with the terms
of the relevant Topco Finance Document (as at the date of the issue of the same or as


-----

amended in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt
Documents), additional amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions relating
to the Topco Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in any Topco
Finance Document, (3) made in pursuance of a debt buy-back program approved by the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors, Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority Second
Lien Creditors (each as defined below), or (4) amounts due under any syndication strategy
letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or
(other than in respect of paragraph (N) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a
Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a
guarantor or borrower under any prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect
of paragraph (L) below) irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities
have accelerated their debt, the payment is not prohibited to be made at such time by any prior
ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien
Liabilities), or the payment is (without double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any
Debt Document, but whether or not permitted by the Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing fees
under any original fee letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents, (B) of commercially
reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring advice and valuations (including
legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or restructuring advisors) and a
Topco Agent’s fees, costs and expenses not exceeding €1,500,000, but excluding the costs of
any litigation against a Senior Secured Creditor or Second Lien Creditor (or their affiliates), (C)
of any amounts owed to a Topco Agent (as defined below), (D) of costs necessary to protect,
preserve or enforce security, (E) of any costs, commissions, taxes, premiums, amendment fees
(including any original issue discount and other consent and/or waiver fees) and any expenses
incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) the Topco Finance Documents (including in
relation to any reporting or listing requirements under the Topco Finance Documents), (F) of
any other amount not exceeding €2,500,000 in any financial year of the Issuer, (G) of any
amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco
Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice is
outstanding) which has been capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco
Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable
in respect of the Topco Liabilities during such period or any such amount described at (i)(C)
above, provided that no such payment may be made if certain events of default have occurred
under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as a result of
making such payment, (H) for as long as an event of default under the Senior Secured
Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities which is continuing, all or part of
the Topco Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the
issues of shares in any holding company of the Issuer (a “Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that
no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does not
result in a Change of Control as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco
Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed by a member of the Senior Secured Group to
another member of the Senior Secured Group, to the Subordinated Creditors or to any other
holding company of the Issuer that arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap are
subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors are
granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Subordinated
Liabilities owed by any member of the Senior Secured Group, (I) of non-cash interest made by
way of capitalizing interest or issuing a non cash-pay instrument which is subordinated on the
same terms as the Topco Liabilities, (J) of audit fees, directors’ fees, taxes and other proper and
incidental expenses required to maintain existence or any other reasonable and administrative
and maintenance costs and expenses of a Topco Borrower or its affiliates, (K) funded directly or
indirectly with the proceeds of Topco Liabilities incurred under or pursuant to any Topco
Finance Documents, (L) by the Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations under the Topco
Finance Documents; and such payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of
the Senior Secured Group or such payment is funded from proceeds received by the Topco


-----

Borrower from the Senior Secured Group without breaching the terms of the Debt Documents,
(M) if the payment is of a principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and made in accordance
with a provision in a Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or any
provision that permits the repayment in full of any single Topco Creditor in the event of a tax
gross-up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable and (N) if no Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and the
payment is a payment of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the final
maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is no earlier
than that contained in the original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date
of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of the applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give
prior consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party
Security Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with
the Topco Finance Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following
the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of
Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien Event of Default”),
the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior Secured
Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered)
(a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the
trustee under any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of
Default or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior
Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine (179) days after delivery of that Topco Payment
Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity
of the relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment
Stop Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default
has been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super
Senior Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for
the relevant stop notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco
Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior
Secured Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than forty five (45) days after the
occurrence of the relevant event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be
served (i) with respect to the same event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of three hundred
and sixty (360) days.


-----

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of
a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an
enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any
Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the
liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the
applicable Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The
accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall
continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice
ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or
Second Lien Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party
that has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the
“Topco Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to
any payments which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement (as applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for
that Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default (as the case may be), then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco
Finance Document or Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice
which may have been issued as a result of that suspension of payments shall be deemed
automatically waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the
latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second
Lien Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully
discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a
Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor,
member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to
the creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either
(x) not prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any
other litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or


-----

any Third Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with
the provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the
liabilities owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party
Security Provider which is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—
Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party
Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(vi) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received
or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and
promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to
the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(vii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or
after the Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives
or recovers from any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security
Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) or following an acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from
any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received or
recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—
_Application of Proceeds.”_

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Debtor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of
any resolution or making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution,
administration or reorganization (excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a composition, compromise,
assignment or arrangement with any class of creditors generally (other than any Secured Party), (c) a
moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (d) the appointment of a liquidator,
receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in
respect of it or any of its assets, or (e) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction,
other than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings, proceedings or appointments which the
Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under any Senior
Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement,
Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or
otherwise not constituting a default.


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party
entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party
Security Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to
the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the
distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured
Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s
liabilities to creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or
otherwise and in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the
extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event,
any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities
owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance
with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the
extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each
creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below),
make demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make
recovery after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to a Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security
Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent
of an Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable)
otherwise as specified in the provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(i) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(A) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors;

(B) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the
Majority Second Lien Creditors; and

(C) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority
Topco Creditors; and

(ii) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(A) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the
Super Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior
Discharge Date”), Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors)
representing more than 662⁄3% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super
Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors
representing more than 662⁄3% of the Super Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Majority
Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean
the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the


-----

enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the
_Designation Date” and “—Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the_
_Designation Date” below;_

(B) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge
Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than
662⁄3% of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(C) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco
Creditors representing more than 662⁄3% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco
Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge
Date, the Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither
to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to
make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities
(acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien
Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority
Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (or Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A)
given no instructions or have instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and
(B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a Topco
Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the
Instructing Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding
paragraph may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain
from enforcing, the Transaction Security as they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at
any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to
give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security do not give such instruction
or do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the Instructing Group sees fit
and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii)
the Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in
good faith that to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security
Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such
enforcement, before giving any such instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other
enforcement action the creditors represented by an Instructing Group will be required to consult with
each other agent (provided that any agent in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if
such enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) for a period of up to ten (10) business days or
take any Enforcement Action (the “Consultation Period”) and the Instructing Group will only be
entitled to give the enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the
expiry of such Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction
Security unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If
the Transaction Security has become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of
those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents,
trustees and hedge counterparties.


-----

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
(ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of
enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial
Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior Discharge has not occurred within six months of the Initial
Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has
occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement
action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until
the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not
made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to
pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the
Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver
instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred,
(v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date,
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not
given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or
(B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, any agent or
trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting on the instructions
of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have
arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien
Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A)
not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions do not give
such instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give
enforcement instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Security
Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such
instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that

(i) to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of
enforcement chosen should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds
must be received in cash, and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not
carried out by way of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent
is so requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit
from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance
with its terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of
the Majority Topco Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce or refrain from enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in
accordance with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including the


-----

selection of any administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the
Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in
the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no
action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers
arising under the Security Documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than
the Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with
the paragraphs above.

_Payment of the Soulte_

If in the context of the appropriation of shares in a member of the Senior Secured Group by
enforcement of any Transaction Security (an “Appropriation”), a Soulte (the amount by which the
value of the charged property appropriated, foreclosed or transferred exceeds the amount of the
relevant secured obligations) is owed by the Secured Parties to any Third Party Security Provider or
Debtor, such Soulte shall be payable by the Secured Parties only on the earlier of the Final Discharge
Date and the date falling twelve (12) months (or eighteen (18) months if a sale process is ongoing)
after the date on which such Appropriation occurs.

other member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to

take Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco
Enforcement) in relation to a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco
Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any
other event of default in respect of the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

elect to purchase the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien
Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on
such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for the counterparties to
hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to specified


-----

conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they
been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

**_Permitted Production Financing_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it
shall (and is irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent,
agreement or instruction from any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt
of a written request from the Issuer: promptly release from the Transaction Security or the Topco
Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents and that it shall promptly execute
any release and/or take such other action or step (including the issuance of any certificates of noncrystallization of floating charges, any consent to dealing or any other similar or equivalent document
that may be required or desirable) under or in relation to any Debt Document relating to any assets in
relation to a Permitted Production Financing (including, without limitation, the distribution rights and
proceeds of distribution and/or exploitation of that Production, but, for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding the shares of any Debtor and any Intra-Group Liabilities owed by any Debtor, and any
Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities or any Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, which are
the subject of any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Security which, is in each case, fixed in
nature (and for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any shares which are subject to non-fixed or
floating charge Security) as is requested by the Company in order to complete, implement or facilitate
that Permitted Production Financing.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it
shall (and is irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent,
agreement or instruction from any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt
of a written request from the Issuer:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the
Issuer has confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable
release and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document
including a disposal to a member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice
to any obligation of any member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance
Document to provide replacement security; or

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents or where any
applicable release and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance
Document pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member
of the Senior Secured Group; and

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a
“Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to the extent
that the Issuer has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document
to effect any amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any
obligation or take any action in relation to such document or agreement;


-----

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any
member of the Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or

guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the

of that Debtor or other member of the Senior Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present
and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such
Debtor and its subsidiaries from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including any claim relating to a Debt Document).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A) or (i)(B) above, the Issuer shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as
at the date of completion of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive
agreement for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant
release or cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the
Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a
Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a
member of Topco Group or a Debtor, to the extent the Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that
it is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a
borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the right to
voluntarily prepay all Liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by
a member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or
shares or financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security (including in each case any
such asset or other financial securities which have been the subject of an Appropriation) which is
being effected (a) at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction
Security has become enforceable as a result of an acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the
Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration
event or the enforcement of security as a result of an acceleration event, by a Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Senior Secured Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized
(subject to acting in accordance with certain conditions set out below) at the cost of the relevant
Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security
Provider or Debtor:


-----

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of
that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary
or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or
other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that
Debtor over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor,
Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all
or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted
by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and
(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a
Debtor over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,
on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or
holding company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured
Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into
any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding
any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a
Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend
that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not
part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other
liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or
any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed
Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities
to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is
also a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of
the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on
behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of
those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.


-----

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions
set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an
enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred,
as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the
Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the
prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone
any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are
entitled to give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any
borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor
unless those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other Senior
Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to
a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral
arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to
give, and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent
is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities,
guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien
Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other
Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of
any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility,
made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor)
immediately following that release.

Where borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the
provisions described above, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing, guarantee or
other liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Issuer, in which case the Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as
are required to so transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

Subject to the provisions described below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities
pursuant to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent,
unless the consent of each Senior Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has
been obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that:

(i) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(ii) such sale or disposal is made (A) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process
conducted with the advice of a reputable, independent or financially recognized investment bank
or firm of accountants (or (if all such banks or firms are conflicted), a reputable, independent
and internationally recognized third party professional firm which is regularly engaged in
providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those subject to the
relevant Transaction Security) and, in each case, not being an auditor or administrator of the
applicable company (a “Financial Advisor”) as selected by the Security Agent (it being
acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial
Advisor until it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), in
respect of which the Secured Creditors are entitled to participate (a “Competitive Sales
Process”); or (B) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an
opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Group which can be relied upon by the
Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the


-----

Topco Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection
with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security
Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant
to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities and/or
Transaction Security securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal
that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities has approved the release,
transfer or disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities
are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the
extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the
Secured Creditors and Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors and their subsidiaries being
sold and disposed of (a “Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally
released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and not
assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all security under documents creating
security in respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the assets of such members of
the Senior Secured Group is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged
concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes
Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors
will recover a greater cash amount if such Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred
to the purchaser or its affiliates and not released or discharged and provided such amount
is nevertheless less than the aggregate amount of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities,
which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders) or if each Senior Agent and
Senior Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that there
are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of
the outstanding amount of Senior Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice on the
Security Agent confirming the same, then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately
to sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a
Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent
has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Group which can be
relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the
Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds
received or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial
point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of
enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or
engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or
prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Topco Liabilities or Transaction
Security securing Topco Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the
provisions described above, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:


-----

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Topco Liabilities has approved the release, transfer or
disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Topco Liabilities are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the
extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the
Secured Creditors and Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors and their subsidiaries being
sold and disposed of (a “Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally
released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and not
assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all security under documents creating
security in respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the assets of such members of
the Senior Secured Group is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged
concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes
Trustee and each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting
reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Priority Secured Parties will recover a
greater cash amount if such Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the
purchaser or its affiliates and not released or discharged and provided such amount is
nevertheless less than the aggregate amount of outstanding Priority Secured Liabilities,
which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent,
Senior Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien
Liabilities (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that there are no bona fide and
fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding
amount of the Priority Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice on the Security
Agent confirming the same, then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell
and transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a
Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent
has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Group which can be
relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the
Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds
received or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial
point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of
enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or
engage any Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or
prefunded to its satisfaction).

When acting for the purposes of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall always act (i) if the
relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Manner of Enforcement” above, and (ii) in any other
case on the instructions of the Instructing Group or, in the absence of such instructions, as the Security
Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

-----

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super
Senior Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain
unpaid after the first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement
Date”) and the resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the
proportions which their respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures
of all the creditors in that specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will
make such payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant
creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in
those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be
amended or waived only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties,
and the Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects
one class of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected
materially or adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement
from the relevant agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class (or in the case of hedging
counterparties, each affected hedge counterparty) shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which
relates to, among others, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order
of priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent
of

(i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under
the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco
Liabilities,

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or
waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management
Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors),

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the
Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of
any other creditor or class of creditors), and

(iv) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors
it represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such
instructions or authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so
consented or authorized to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that
agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security
Agent may, if the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or
grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security which shall be binding on each party. Where any such amendment, release or waiver of, or
consent under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) or the manner in which the proceeds of


-----

enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed,
such amendment may not be made without the prior consent of:

(i) each of the agents or trustees other than an agent under any Cash Management Facility, if
appointed (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior
Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender or the agent for the relevant Cash Management Facility
on its behalf but only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the
relevant document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security in
their capacity as such and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any
other creditor or class of creditors,

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the under
the relevant document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or
class of creditors), and

(iv) the Issuer.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such
(including any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement)
may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers:
_Transaction Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement,_
relating in particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security, claims or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the
Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the
incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,”
“—Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver
or consent effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such
matters can be effected solely by the Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any
action or to provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar
snooze/lose provision), any creditor fails to respond to the request within ten (10) business days (or
any other period of time notified by the Issuer, with the agreement of each of the agents or trustee in
the case of a shorter period of time) or fails to provide details of its credit participation, such creditor
will be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed to
have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an “IPO”), the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will
automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all related
provisions) will now refer to the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the
Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown
Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO, the IPO


-----

Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Issuer which is the issuer or borrower of any
Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made
excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) certain provisions of the Debt
Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will cease to apply to any
holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (such transaction, the “IPO Pushdown”).

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the
Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security) and
each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be released from its obligations and
restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders
under and as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50%
of any Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility
and noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant
IPO), each subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall also be released from all obligations as
Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security (other than, in
each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter
into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters.

**Existing Senior Notes**

On the Existing Notes Issue Date, Banijay issued the Existing Senior Notes under the Existing Senior
Notes Indenture, which comprised €400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.500% senior
notes due 2026. The Existing Senior Notes Indenture contains restrictive covenants, each of which is
subject to significant exceptions and qualifications and customary events of default which are
substantially similar to the covenants and events of default in respect of the Notes offered hereby.

The Existing Senior Notes will mature on March 1, 2026. Banijay pays interest on the Existing Senior
Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. At any time upon the
provision of a redemption notice, Banijay may redeem all or part of the Existing Senior Notes at the
redemption prices set forth in the Existing Senior Notes Indenture.

The Existing Senior Notes are general senior obligations of Banijay and (i) rank pari passu in right of
payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of Banijay, (ii) rank senior in right of
payment to all of Banijay’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Existing Senior Notes, (iii) are effectively subordinated to all of Banijay’s existing and
future indebtedness that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Existing Senior Notes,
or that is secured on a first-priority basis by property or assets that secure the Existing Senior Notes
on a second-priority basis, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such
indebtedness and (iv) are structurally subordinated to any existing and future debt of Banijay’s
existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Existing Senior Notes, including their
obligations to trade creditors. The Existing Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated and
unsecured basis by the Guarantors.

The Existing Senior Notes and the guarantees thereof are, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, secured (i) on a first-priority basis by an account pledge granted by Banijay in respect of
its material bank accounts and (ii) on a second-priority basis by a share pledge granted by Banijay in
respect of shares held by it in the Issuer and an intercompany receivables pledge granted by Banijay in
respect of structural intercompany receivables owing to it by the Issuer.

**Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements**

From time to time, we enter into various credit facilities (including by way of factoring or assignment
of receivables, overdraft facility agreements, local and bilateral facilities or future receivables) to


-----

finance the development, production and operation of a specific program or audiovisual or digital
content. We also enter into loan agreements to finance specific programs, such as a credit line to fund
_Domina. As of June 30, 2023, we had €157.6 million outstanding under these credit facilities. As of_
June 30, 2023, we had €159.3 million of other long-term and other current liabilities recorded on our
balance sheet to reflect earn-outs and put option agreements that remain outstanding. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity
_and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities.”_

###### DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES

The following is a description of the €     million in aggregate principal amount of     % Senior
Secured Notes due 2029 (the “Euro Senior Secured Notes”) and $     million in aggregate principal
amount of    % Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the “Dollar Senior Secured Notes” and together
with the Euro Senior Secured Notes, the “Senior Secured Notes”). The Senior Secured Notes will be
issued by Banijay Entertainment S.A.S. (the “Senior Secured Notes Issuer”). In this “Description of
the Notes,” the “Senior Secured Notes Issuer” refers only to Banijay Entertainment S.A.S., and any
successor obligor to Banijay Entertainment S.A.S. under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (as
defined below) and the Senior Secured Notes, and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

On the Issue Date, the proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes (the “Senior Secured
_Notes Offering”) will be used by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to (i) redeem the entire outstanding_
amount of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and (ii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Transactions, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.”

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue the Senior Secured Notes under an indenture, to be dated
as of the Issue Date (the “Senior Secured Notes Indenture”), among, inter alios, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and Elavon Financial Services
DAC, as security agent (the “Security Agent”). The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in a private
transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Notice to
_Investors.” The terms of the Senior Secured Notes include those stated in the Senior Secured Notes_
Indenture. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be qualified under, be subject to, or include or
incorporate by reference terms of, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Senior Secured Notes, and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. It does
not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to all provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, respectively. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is
important to you. You should read the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents in their entirety. Copies of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents are available as described under “Listing and
_General Information.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—_
_Certain Definitions.”_

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. In
general, only registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Senior Secured Notes**

**_Ranking of the Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will:

    - be general, senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

    - be secured by the Collateral (as defined below) on a first-priority basis, which Collateral
also secures obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging
Obligations, if any;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s existing
and future Indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured
Notes (including the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations, if any, and certain other future
Indebtedness permitted to be incurred and secured on the Collateral);


-----

    - rank senior in right of payment to all of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s future
Indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured
Notes, including the Senior Note Guarantees;

    - be guaranteed (i) on the Issue Date by the Senior Notes Issuer and (ii) within 60 days of
the Issue Date by the Post-Issue Date Guarantors (as defined below), in each case on a
senior basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and subject to the limitations
described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”;_

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or obligation of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that
do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing
such obligation or Indebtedness; and

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of subsidiaries of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer (including obligations to trade creditors) that do not
guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral (as defined below) on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note
Guarantees, including obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging
Obligations; _provided that, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant_
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain Indebtedness may be designated
as having super senior priority pursuant to the operation of the Intercreditor Agreement, in which
case, such super senior priority Indebtedness will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral and certain distressed disposals in priority to holders of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant
to the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The Senior Secured Note Guarantees_**

The Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed (i) on the Issue Date by the Senior Notes Issuer and (ii)
within 60 days of the Issue Date by Banijay Group US Holding, Inc., Banijay France S.A.S,
Adventure Line Productions S.A.S, H2O Productions S.A.S, Banijay Production Media, Bwark
Productions Limited, Banijay Rights Limited, Castaway Television Productions Limited, RDF

Shine Germany GmbH, Endemol Shine Italy S.p.A., Aurora TV S.r.l., CAPE CROSS Studio- und
Filmlichtgesellschaft mbH and Raab TV - Produktion GmbH (together, the “Post-Issue Date
_Guarantors”)._

In addition, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may be required to guarantee the Senior Secured
Notes in the future under certain circumstances.

Each Senior Secured Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will:

    - be a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

    - rank _pari passu in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future_
Indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to its Senior Secured Note


-----

Guarantee (including its senior guarantee granted in favor of the Senior Facilities
Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations, if any and, with respect to the Guarantee of
the Senior Secured Notes by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes);

    - rank senior in right of payment to all of such Guarantor’s future Indebtedness that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Senior Secured Note Guarantee,
including such Guarantor’s Senior Note Guarantee;

    - rank effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such
Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the
obligations under the Senior Secured Note Guarantees;

    - rank effectively senior to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor secured
on a second ranking basis by property or assets that secure the Senior Secured Note
Guarantee on a first ranking basis;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and such Guarantor (including obligations to trade creditors) that is secured
by property or assets that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such obligations or Indebtedness;

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor’s
subsidiaries (including obligations to trade creditors) that do not guarantee the Senior
Secured Notes; and

    - be subject to the Agreed Security Principles, as well as limitations described herein and in
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests,” “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The security over the Collateral_
_will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to_
_the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes and the Guarantees will be_
_structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries and effectively_
_subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Notes” and_
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The
_insolvency and administrative laws of applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to_
_creditors, including investors in the Notes, as the insolvency laws of the jurisdictions with_
_which you are familiar, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes,_
_the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.”_

Substantially all the operations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are conducted through its
Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured
creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of
preferred stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries, generally will have priority with respect to the
assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes
therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that do not Guarantee the
Senior Secured Notes. Although the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will limit the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, these limitations will
be subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does
not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not
considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

The obligations of the Guarantors will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and be
contractually limited under the applicable Senior Secured Note Guarantees to reflect limitations under
applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance


-----

and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors
and general partners as further outlined below.

_France_

To ensure compliance with French law, the Senior Secured Note Guarantees of the French Guarantors
(as defined below) will be subject to substantially the following limitation language in the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,

(1) any covenants made by any Guarantor organized under the laws of France (a “French
_Guarantor”) shall be strictly limited to matters related to such French Guarantor and its_
subsidiaries in connection with the Senior Secured Notes;

(2) any expenses or indemnities to be paid by any French Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture shall be limited to the expenses or indemnities incidental to the performance of its
obligations and the obligations of its subsidiaries under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture in
connection with the Senior Secured Notes; and

(3) (without limitation to the foregoing) any obligations or liabilities incurred or assumed under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture by any French Guarantor (a) shall not include any obligations or
liabilities which, if incurred, would constitute a violation of its corporate interest (intérêt social)
and/or which would result in such French Guarantor not complying with French financial
assistance rules within the meaning of article L.225-216 of the French Commercial Code (Code
_de commerce) and/or would constitute a misuse of corporate assets within the meaning of articles_
L.241-3 or L.242-6 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) or any other law or
regulations having the same effect and (b) shall be limited to the payment obligations of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer in relation to the Senior Secured Notes up to an amount equal to the
aggregate amount made available to such French Guarantor by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
(by way of intra group loans) directly or indirectly through another member of the Group (as
defined herein) which will on lend such amount to such French Guarantor and outstanding from
time to time (the “Maximum Guaranteed Amount”); provided that:

(a) any payment made by such French Guarantor under the relevant Senior Secured Note
Guarantees in respect of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall reduce
pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor
under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above; and

(b) any repayment of such intercompany loans by such French Guarantor shall reduce pro
tanto the relevant Maximum Guaranteed Amount of such French Guarantor.

For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by a French Guarantor under paragraph (3)(b) above
shall reduce the related Maximum Guaranteed Amount.

It is acknowledged that no French Guarantor is acting jointly and severally with the other Guarantors
and no French Guarantor shall therefore be considered as “co-débiteur solidaire” with the other
Guarantors as to its obligations pursuant to the guarantee given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

**_Senior Secured Note Guarantees Release_**

The Senior Secured Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released upon:

(1) a direct or indirect sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (a) any Capital Stock of the
relevant Guarantor as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted
Subsidiary, or (b) all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor to a Person other than the


-----

Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and, in each case, as otherwise not
prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of the Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or legal defeasance, covenant
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(4) upon the release of the Guarantor’s guarantee of any Indebtedness that triggered such Guarantor’s
obligation to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes under the covenant described in “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees”; provided that no other Indebtedness is at that time_
Guaranteed by the Guarantor that would result in the requirement that the Guarantor provide a

Interest on the Euro Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of   % per annum and interest on
the Dollar Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of    % per annum. Interest on the Senior

not include) the relevant interest payment date.

**Additional Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may issue additional Euro Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional
_Euro Senior Secured Notes”) and additional Dollar Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional Dollar_
_Senior Secured Notes” and together with the Additional Euro Senior Secured Notes, the “Additional_
_Senior Secured Notes”) from time to time under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, so long as such_
issuance is in compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). Any series of Additional Euro Senior Secured_

determining such interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue,
the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such
dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such
interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be denominated
and the currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of
Additional Senior Secured Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms
and conditions upon which, such Additional Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed, in whole

Except as otherwise provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, each of the Euro Senior
Secured Notes (together with any Additional Euro Senior Secured Notes) and the Dollar Senior
Secured Notes (together with any Additional Dollar Senior Secured Notes) will constitute a separate
series of Senior Secured Notes, but shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, in respect of any amendment, waiver or other
modification of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any other action by the Holders thereunder.
Additional Senior Secured Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same
series as the original Senior Secured Notes, in some cases may not be fungible with the original
Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes and will be allocated a separate CUSIP,
ISIN and common code, as applicable. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of
_the Notes,” references to the “Senior Secured Notes” include the Euro Senior Secured Notes and the_
Dollar Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Euro Senior Secured Notes and Additional Dollar
Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes. For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the


-----

Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will notify the
Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will initially be issued in the form of registered notes in global form
without interest coupons, as follows:

    - each series of Euro Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified
institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “144A Global Euro Senior Secured Notes”) and each series of Dollar Senior
Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Dollar
_Senior Secured Notes” and together with the 144A Global Euro Senior Secured Notes, the_
“144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Euro Senior Secured Notes will, on the Issue
Date, be deposited with the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. The 144A Global Dollar Senior
Secured Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with the custodian for DTC and
registered in the name of the nominee for DTC; and

    - each series of Euro Senior Secured Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United
States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by
one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Euro Senior Secured Notes”) and each series of Dollar Senior
Secured Notes sold to non-U.S. person outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Dollar
_Senior Secured Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Global Euro Senior Secured_
Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the
“Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Euro Senior Secured Notes will, on the Issue
Date, be deposited with the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. The Regulation S Global Dollar
Senior Secured Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with the custodian for DTC
and registered in the name of the nominee for DTC.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, or persons that may hold interests
through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof
will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and
described more fully under “Notice to Investors.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests
between participants in Euroclear, participants in Clearstream or participants in DTC will be effected
by Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, and
their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in a 144A Global Note (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to
a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note
(“Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification
(in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
effected pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation S. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon
delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person that the transferor reasonably


-----

believes is purchasing the 144A Book-Entry Interests for its own account, or for one or more accounts
with respect to which such person exercises sole investment discretion, and such person and each such
account is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act
in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, and such transfer is in compliance with any
applicable blue sky securities laws of any state of the United States.

No Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Euro Senior Secured Notes (the “Global
_Euro Senior Secured Notes”), and no Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry_
Interest in the Global Euro Senior Secured Notes (the “Definitive Registered Euro Senior Secured
_Notes”), may be transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note_
representing the Dollar Senior Secured Notes (the “Global Dollar Senior Secured Notes”) or any
Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Dollar Senior
Secured Notes (the “Definitive Registered Dollar Senior Secured Notes”), and no Book-Entry Interest
in the Global Dollar Senior Secured Notes and no Definitive Registered Dollar Senior Secured Note
may be transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Euro Senior Secured Note
or any Definitive Registered Euro Senior Secured Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in
the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global
Note to which it is transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all
transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of
the Euro Senior Secured Notes) and $200,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes), upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation
required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based
upon directions received by Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, from the participant that
owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a BookEntry Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or as otherwise
determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to,
and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described
more fully under “Notice to Investors.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Euro Senior Secured Notes issued as
Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum
denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and
Dollar Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged,
in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of $200,000 in principal amount and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things,
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the
account of the transferee at Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, to furnish certain
certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges in connection with
such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder,
other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agents and the Paying
Agents will be entitled to treat the Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted
Subsidiaries.


-----

In the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary therein, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will
provide that any obligation to accede a Restricted Subsidiary to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as
a Guarantor or to pledge assets as Collateral will be limited pursuant to the Agreed Security
Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security
Principles, which include, among others:

    - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance,
corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin
capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax
restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity
impairment” rules, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the Senior Notes Issuer, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and their respective Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the
“Group”) to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security
be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited
accordingly; provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing
any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall
use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact
on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such
guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

    - the determination that the time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest
deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs, guarantee fees payable to any
person that is not a member of the Group and all applicable legal fees) related to granting
the relevant guarantee and/or security (including in respect of the security, the extent of
its perfection and/or registration) will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to
the relevant secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

    - the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement,
contract, lease, license, instrument or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or
condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security
document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works
council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security
document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights,
benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the
asset or require the relevant charger to take any action materially adverse to the interests
of the Group or any member thereof; provided that reasonable endeavors for a period of
time (for a period of not more than ten Business Days, without incurring material costs
and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to obtain consent to
charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the asset is
material and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will not
involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

    - the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter
into security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or


-----

if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would
conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any
applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential
to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of or
for any member of the Group, provided that the relevant member of the Group shall, in
relation to a contractual prohibition or restriction only, use reasonable endeavors (but
without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third
parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document
shall be subject to such limit;

- the requirement that, to the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favor of
the Security Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to
hold one set of security documents for all the secured creditors); provided that it shall be
permissible to use “parallel debt” provisions where necessary (which shall be included in
the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security documents); and furthermore,
the agreement that no member of the Group shall be required to take any action in relation
to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or transfer of the Senior
Secured Notes by a Holder;

- the limitation of guarantees and security so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all
registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed
€5,000 and the agreement that where a class of assets to be secured includes material and
immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is
disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material
assets only;

- the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in
favor of a third party (other than in relation to security under general business conditions
of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the creation of security over such
account) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or
cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document);

- the agreement it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the
turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and that guarantees and
security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly owned
by another member of the Group;

- that agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration
and/or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its
operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (including dealing with the
secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or
allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an applicable
acceleration event which is continuing), and the agreement that any requirement under the
Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other
action shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles;

- the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no
perfection, filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not
owned by members of the Group or in India, Russia, China, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico,
South Korea and Thailand; and


-----

    - the agreement that the Senior Secured Note Guarantees and the Collateral may be granted
at any time as long as these are granted substantially simultaneously with the guarantees
and security interests in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, in
accordance with the Senior Facilities Agreement.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—No Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,”_
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with
future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any
Additional Senior Secured Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Capital Structure.”

**_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each case
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of
all holders of secured obligations. The enforcement of the Security Documents will be subject to the
procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. For a
description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to
various bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s bankruptcy. See
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Security Interests,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral—The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the_
_Notes,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The_
_insolvency and administrative laws of applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to creditors,_
_including investors in the Notes, as the insolvency laws of the jurisdictions with which you are_
_familiar, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the_
_security interests in the Collateral.” In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral will be limited to_
the maximum amount required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit,
financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligation under the Senior Secured Notes could be significantly less
than the total amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. See “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The_
_security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to
remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral, to freely operate the Collateral and
to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

The rights of the Security Agent (acting on its behalf or on behalf of the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes) to take enforcement action under the Security Documents in respect of the Collateral are
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. There can be no assurance that the
proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement. By its nature, some or all of
the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time, if at all.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to
cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or all


-----

of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or certain other competitive sales
processes or only at a price confirmed by a valuation, subject to certain exceptions. See “Description
_of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Trustee has, and by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have:

    - irrevocably appointed Elavon Financial Services DAC, as Security Agent, to act as its
agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a
party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents);

    - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights,
powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement
or other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security
Documents), together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii)
execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement
expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

    - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the
Trustee to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor
Agreement overrides any provisions in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and to the
extent that any step or action is permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, it will be
deemed permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent will take any action required to effectuate any release of Collateral required by a
Security Document under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or discharge or defeasance
thereof as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Senior Secured Note Guarantee in accordance
with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets and Capital
Stock of such Guarantor;

(3) in connection with any disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, to (a) any Person other
than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries if such disposition is
permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or (b) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, provided that in the case of this clause (b) and subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, the relevant Collateral becomes reasonably promptly subject to a
substantially equivalent Lien over the same Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—No Impairment of
_Security Interest”;_

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Indebtedness
that gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released;

(6) in a transaction that complies with the provisions described in “—Certain Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation”; provided that in such a transaction where the Senior Secured Notes Issuer_
or any Guarantor ceases to exist, the Lien on the Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or such Guarantor will be released and, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will
reattach (or a new Lien will be created) over the Capital Stock of the successor entity pursuant
to a new share pledge (on terms substantially equivalent to the existing Lien on the Capital
Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable) granted by the holder
of such Capital Stock;


-----

(7) if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
the release of Liens on property and assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(8) as otherwise provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

(9) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization.

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent and, to the extent it is necessary, the
Trustee without the consent of the Holders.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the (1) Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is permitted to share in the Collateral or permitted to be Incurred
under the first paragraph or clauses (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (11) or (14) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (2) any
Indebtedness the proceeds of which are used, in whole or in part, to refinance Indebtedness referred to
in the foregoing clause (1), the Trustee and the Security Agent shall, at the request of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, enter into with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the relevant Restricted
Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) one or
more intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other
modification of the Intercreditor Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on
substantially similar terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that are not materially less
favorable to the Holders) with respect to sharing of the proceeds of security and enforcement of
security, priority, release of security, turnover, limitation on enforcement and other rights contained in
the Intercreditor Agreement; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose
any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or adversely affect the personal rights,
duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee and Security Agent such documentation in relation
thereto as it may reasonably require.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall
consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance,
acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes
thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described herein
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent or any
other relevant creditor representative or collateral agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure
any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or
types of Indebtedness covered by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement that may be Incurred by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries that
is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including the addition
of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured
Notes (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional
Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Senior Secured Notes or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (6) to facilitate a
Permitted Reorganization otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or (7) make any
other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders of Senior Secured
Notes in any material respect. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee


-----

or Security Agent or any other relevant creditor representative or collateral agent to enter into any
amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted
by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer may only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to
the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent
or adversely affect the personal rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee
or the Security Agent under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured
Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in
the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized the Trustee and the
Security Agent and any other relevant creditor representative or collateral agent to enter into the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any restatement, replacement,
amendment or other modification to reflect the above on each Holder’s behalf and neither the Trustee
nor the Security Agent will be required to seek the consent of the Holders to perform its obligations
under and in accordance with the above provisions. The Intercreditor Agreement overrides any
provisions in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and to the extent that any step or action is permitted
under the Intercreditor Agreement, it will be deemed permitted under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made
available to the Holders upon request and will be made available for inspection during normal
business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the office of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer.

with the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer from any Equity Offering at

**_General_**

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s discretion, be
subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent (including, without limitation, the
consummation of an Equity Offering or the Incurrence of Indebtedness the proceeds of which will be
used to redeem the Senior Secured Notes). In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in
the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed; provided, however, that in no case shall the notice have been delivered
less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs.

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Senior Secured Notes, it will,
for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of
the Exchange so require, inform the Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such
redemption.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Euro Senior Secured Notes
or Dollar Senior Secured Notes, including a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset
Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders of the Euro Senior Secured Notes or Dollar Senior
Secured Notes, as applicable, of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable
outstanding Euro Senior Secured Notes or Dollar Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not
validly withdraw such Euro Senior Secured Notes or Dollar Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer
and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, purchases, all of the Euro Senior Secured Notes or Dollar Senior
Secured Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of the
Euro Senior Secured Notes or Dollar Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, will be deemed to have


-----

consented to such tender offer and, accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such third party
will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30
days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Euro Senior Secured Notes or Dollar
Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part following such
purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or
incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such
redemption date.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related
interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the
Senior Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such interest record date, and no
additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured Notes will be subject to
redemption by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

Subject to compliance with the covenants contained herein, we may at any time and from time to time
repurchase Senior Secured Notes. Any such purchases may be made through open market or privately
negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or
otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any such Affiliates may determine.

**Sinking Fund**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or
sinking fund payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. However, under certain
circumstances, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Senior Secured
Notes as described under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”_

**Selection and Notice**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be
equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with
the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). Under the existing practices and
procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Euro Senior Secured Notes or
the Dollar Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions), such as by way of pool factor or by lot, unless otherwise required by
law or applicable stock exchange, clearing system or depositary requirements; provided, however, that
no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount with respect to the applicable Euro
Senior Secured Notes and less than $200,000 principal amount with respect to Dollar Senior Secured
Notes may be redeemed in part. If the Senior Secured Notes are not held through DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, the Senior Secured Notes will be selected on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so
that no Senior Secured Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such
redemption; provided, however, that no Euro Senior Secured Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal
amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Euro Senior Secured Notes in integral multiples of
€1,000 shall be redeemed and that no Dollar Senior Secured Note of $200,000 in aggregate principal
amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Dollar Senior Secured Notes in integral multiples of
$1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrar shall not be liable for
selections made under this paragraph.

So long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of
the Exchange so require, any such notice to the Holders of the relevant Senior Secured Notes shall to
the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules be posted on the official website of the Exchange


-----

and in addition to such release, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption
date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will mail, or at the expense of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
cause to be mailed, such notice to Holders by first class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective
addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption may
instead be posted on the website of the Exchange.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which
case a portion of the original Senior Secured Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof
upon cancellation of the original Senior Secured Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an
amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption
notice (including any conditions contained therein), Senior Secured Notes called for redemption
become due on the date fixed for redemption (as delayed from time to time pursuant to such notice).
On and after the redemption date, unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of
the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of them called for
redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer (as defined below), may
redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (which notice will be
irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”)
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date that is prior to the Tax Redemption Date) and all Additional Amounts
(see “—Withholding Taxes”), then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a
result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Successor Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor determine in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below); or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official application, administration or
published interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding,
judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each
of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor
are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes would be, required to
pay any Additional Amounts (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or another Guarantor who can make
such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be
avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Successor
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). In the case of redemption due to
withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
at the date of the Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and
become effective on or after the date of the Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to
withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction after the date of the Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must be formally
announced and become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction, unless the Change in Tax Law would have permitted a redemption hereunder for the
predecessor of the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer. The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to
a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the
Senior Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person


-----

becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture with respect to a change or amendments
occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the
procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice
of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as
defined below) would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in
respect of the Senior Secured Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such
obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of
any notice of redemption of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s
Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts
showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that it would
not be able to avoid the obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures
available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Successor Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor has or have been or will become obligated to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled
to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be
conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any Successor Senior Secured
Notes Issuer is incorporated or organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency
thereof or therein.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
relevant Guarantor (a “Payor”) on the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Note Guarantees
will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes
unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note or any Senior
Secured Note Guarantee is made by or on behalf of a Payor or the Paying Agent, or any political
subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental
Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant
_Taxing Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required from any payments made by or on behalf of a Payor or the Paying Agent
with respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Note Guarantee, including payments
of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor will pay (together with such
payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the
net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders after such withholding or deduction
(including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than
the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such
Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or
deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Senior Secured Note (or
between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over
the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing


-----

Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or
maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition,
ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or
Senior Secured Note Guarantee, or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of
rights in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes to the extent that they are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder
or the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request
of the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be made), to provide certification, information, documents or
other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial
owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement
relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in
the rate of withholding or deduction of, all or part of such Taxes;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior
Secured Note for payment (where Senior Secured Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered
Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment
date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to
the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior
Secured Notes been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior
Secured Note Guarantees;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the
existence of any connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Senior
Secured Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust,
partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
any Guarantor (including, without limitation, being a shareholder of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Guarantor) other than the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior
Secured Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such
Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(7) any Taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or
successor version of such Sections that is substantively comparable), any U.S. Treasury
regulations or other official guidance promulgated thereunder, any intergovernmental agreement
entered into in connection therewith, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an
intergovernmental agreement between a non U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect
to any of the foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to section 1471(b)(1) of the
Code; or

(8) any combination of items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any Taxes imposed on or with
respect to a payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or other than the sole beneficial
owner of such Senior Secured Notes to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such
payment had such Holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Senior Secured Note.


-----

The Payor will (i) make any withholding or deduction it is required to make under applicable law and
(ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain
certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from
each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary
course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to
obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable
evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent.
Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made
available at the offices of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made
on any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date
of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee, with a copy to the Paying Agent, an Officer’s
Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and
such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders
on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45
days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate
as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and
Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

Wherever in either the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any Senior Secured Note Guarantees or this
“Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this
heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in
respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court, documentary, excise, property or similar taxes,
charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in any
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Senior
Secured Notes, Senior Secured Note Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security
Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than, in each case, in
connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes occurring after the initial resale), and the Payor
agrees to reimburse the Holders for any such taxes paid by such Holders. The foregoing obligations
will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which
any Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer or successor to a Payor is incorporated, organized,
engaged in business or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which
any payment on the Senior Secured Notes (or any Senior Secured Note Guarantees) is made by or on
behalf of such Person or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase all or part (in integral multiples of €1,000 with respect
to Euro Senior Secured Notes and $1,000 with respect to Dollar Senior Secured Notes; provided that


-----

Euro Senior Secured Notes of €100,000 or less and Dollar Senior Secured Notes of $200,000 or less
may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of
_Control Offer”);_ _provided, however, that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not be obligated to_
repurchase Senior Secured Notes as described under this “Change of Control” section in the event and
to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or
waived.

Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver or
cause to be delivered a notice of a Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable or by first-class mail, with a
copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes at the address of such Holder appearing
in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to
require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the
“Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, consistent with the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured
Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is transmitted prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of
all Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global
Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof
that have been tendered to and purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer.


-----

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will wire transfer to each
Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior
Secured Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail to
each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Euro Senior Secured Note or Dollar Senior Secured
Note, as applicable, equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Euro
Senior Secured Notes or Dollar Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such
new Euro Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and each such Dollar Senior Secured Note will be in an
aggregate principal amount that is at least $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if
and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will notify
the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other
provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with
respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior
Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a
Holder’s right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Secured
Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of
Control.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a
Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all
Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made
in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if
a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, or an offer or other transaction that if
consummated would result in a Change of Control has been publicly announced and, if applicable, not
withdrawn, at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of
Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (or rules of
any exchange on which the Senior Secured Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of
Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may require prepayment and
cancellation or other consequences in respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement. Future debt of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Senior Secured Notes Issuer from
purchasing Senior Secured Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of
Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the
Holders of their right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes
could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself
does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

Finally, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence
of a Change of Control may be limited by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s then existing financial
resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make


-----

the required purchase of the Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Guarantees and the Collateral— The Issuer may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance a_
_change of control offer and, if this occurs, the Issuer would be in default under the Indenture.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property
and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to
specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a
Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a
Holder may require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior
Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control
may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Senior_

Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s most recently ended

(17) any Guarantees by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor of Parent Debt;

Indenture and this covenant other than this clause (17); provided, further, that such Guarantees
are subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees pursuant
to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (2) below, in the event that Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the
criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second
paragraphs of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify,
and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include
the amount and type of such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in one of the clauses of the
second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this
covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such
Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other
provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) (a) all Indebtedness Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed Incurred under
clause (1)(ii) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant; (b) all Indebtedness
Incurred under the Term Loan Facilities shall be deemed Incurred under clause (1)(i) of the
second paragraph of the description of this covenant; and (c) all Indebtedness that is granted
super senior status pursuant to clause (1)(a) of the second paragraph of the definition of
“Permitted Collateral Liens” shall be deemed Incurred under clause (1)(ii) of the second
paragraph of the description of this covenant, and, in the case of (a), (b) and (c), may not be
reclassified;

(3) (i) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments or any “parallel debt” obligation (including any parallel debt obligation under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) relating to, or Liens
securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of
Indebtedness shall not be included and (ii) any Guarantee by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Indebtedness Incurred by a Parent, where the Net Cash Proceeds of
such Indebtedness are on-lent to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and
such proceeds loan is otherwise included in the determination of a permitted amount of
Indebtedness, shall not be double-counted;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are

letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness,
then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted

maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any
redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(8) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(9) in the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or
increases commitments under a revolving Credit Facility, obtains any commitment for
Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (25) of the definition of “Permitted
Liens,” the incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, including without limitation for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (17) of the
preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving Credit
Facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has
been Incurred as Indebtedness as of such date) or other Indebtedness and, if such Consolidated
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or
reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Consolidated
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of
credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or
reborrowed on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved
_Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Fixed Charge_
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total
Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding as
Indebtedness under the first or second paragraph of this covenant, as applicable) or (b) be
determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased
commitment, and in each case, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may revoke such determination
at any time and from time to time; and

(10) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at
the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA
restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the
date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be
deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does
not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums
(including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS
will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under
this caption “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any
date shall be calculated as specified under the definition of “Indebtedness.”


-----

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in
another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit
facility; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness_
denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable eurodenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (b) the euro equivalent
of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for
so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in
which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the
amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment
required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the euro equivalent of such
amount plus the euro equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not
covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not
be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The
principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a
different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated
that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of, or availability under, any Applicable Metric under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, in each case, in connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint
venture, Investment, Incurrence or other similar transaction where there is a time difference between
commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness, Restricted
Payments and Investments), the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at the option of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, either be (x) the date any definitive agreement, written commitment,
put option or similar agreement (conditional or otherwise) for such acquisition, disposition, merger,
joint venture, Investment, Incurrence or similar transaction are entered into or (y) the date of such
acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment, Incurrence or similar transaction and, in
each case, such Applicable Metric shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such
acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment, Incurrence or similar transaction and the
other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Restricted Payment,
Permitted Investment, Asset Disposition, Incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof (including any acquisition completed using such proceeds) and any other acquisition,
disposition, merger, joint venture Investment or other similar transaction that is at the time of
determination the subject of a definitive agreement) as if they occurred at the beginning of the
applicable Relevant Testing Period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such
transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any Applicable Metric).

For the avoidance of doubt: (i) if any Applicable Metric is exceeded or unsatisfied as a result of
fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA,
Indebtedness, Senior Secured Indebtedness or cash and Cash Equivalents of the Senior Secured Notes


-----

Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any target company) subsequent to such date of determination and
at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed
to have been exceeded or unsatisfied as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of
determining whether the transactions are permitted hereunder; and (ii) such Applicable Metric shall
not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related transactions, provided that if
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such
definitive agreement (including any definitive agreement, written commitment or put option or similar
agreement (conditional or otherwise)), any such transactions (including any Restricted Payment,
Permitted Investment, Asset Disposition or Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such transactions.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to:

redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking
fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the
date of purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b)
any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock,

marketable securities received in connection with) the sale or other disposition
to a Person other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of any such Restricted Investment, repayments of loans or advances
or other transfers of assets (including by way of dividend, distribution, interest
payments or returns of capital) to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any

of the property received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary), which amount, in each case under this clause (c)(iv), was included
in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments referred to in the first

under the foregoing clause (c)(v).

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be

the greater of €85 million and 15.0% of Consolidated EBITDA.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such
Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount,
and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by an
Officer or the Board of Directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer acting in good faith. For
purposes hereof, unsecured Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinate or junior to
Indebtedness that is secured by virtue of it not being secured.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in
no event shall the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary be permitted to dispose
of, or grant an exclusive license to, any Material Intellectual Property to any Unrestricted Subsidiary.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

Neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor the Senior Notes Issuer will, and will permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its
property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or the Senior Notes Issuer), and neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor the Senior Notes
Issuer will, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien on the Collateral owned by
it, in each case whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or
any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial
_Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted_
Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior Secured Notes and


-----

the Senior Secured Notes Indenture are directly secured (subject to the Agreed Security Principles)
equally and ratably with, or prior or senior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated
Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so
secured and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral
Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding
paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—
_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens” and “—Security—Release of Liens.”_

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase
in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of
accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation
preference, in each case with respect to such Indebtedness, and increases in the amount of
Indebtedness resulting solely from fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or
otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock held by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or pay any Indebtedness or other
obligations owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

(b) make any loans or advances to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination
of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior
Facilities Agreement), (b) the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes, the Senior
Notes Indenture and related security documents and the Security Documents or (c) any other
agreement in effect on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to
any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such
Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary
or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or
Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized
to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or was


-----

merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on
such date;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which
such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in
good faith by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the extent such
encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such
mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in each case, that impose
encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired in the nature of clause (c) of the
preceding paragraph or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that
imposes restrictions on the transfer or distribution of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint
venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or
assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition
to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or
the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or
disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements
and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable
rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority or any governmental licenses,
concessions, franchises or permits, including restrictions or encumbrances on cash or deposits
(including assets in escrow accounts);

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or
suppliers, or as required by insurance, surety or bonding companies or indemnities, in each case,
under agreements or policies entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or
Commodity Hedging Agreements;


-----

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (A) the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially
less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
together with the security documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) in
comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or an
Officer thereof) or (B) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer determines at the time of the Incurrence
of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any
material respect, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments
on the Senior Secured Notes;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on
_Liens”;_

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing, that, in the good faith
determination of an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, are
necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables Financing; or

(14) customary restrictions included in shareholder agreements relating to non-Wholly Owned
Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
make any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives
consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility
for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair
market value to be determined as of the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition),
as determined in good faith by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form
of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary within 365 days from the later of (A)
the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, as the case may
be:

(a) to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may
be, elects (or is required by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary),

(i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) or Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities
Agreement or any other Senior Secured Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (1)
of the second paragraph of the “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant;


-----

(ii) to redeem, prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more
than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of such redemption, prepayment, repayment or purchase
plus a premium over par no greater than the premium offered to the Holders of
Senior Secured Notes in the pro rata offer described in the following proviso, if
applicable; provided that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall redeem, repay or
purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt pursuant to this clause (ii) only
if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer makes (at such time or subsequently in
compliance with this covenant) an offer to all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes to
purchase their Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to or greater than
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not
including) the date of purchase and/or pursuant to the redemption provisions set
forth above under the caption “—Optional Redemption” on a pro rata basis with any
such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that is purchased; or

(iii) to redeem, prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is secured by a Lien on property or assets of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than a Permitted
Collateral Lien);

(b) to redeem Senior Secured Notes or purchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to
all Holders at a purchase price equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest (at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Restricted
Subsidiary) and/or pursuant to the redemption provisions set forth above under the caption
“—Optional Redemption”;

(c) to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest
in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in
Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary); _provided, however, that_
any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding
agreement or a commitment that is executed within such time will satisfy this requirement
so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days following the expiration of
the aforementioned 365-day period; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause_
(a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
temporarily reduce Indebtedness (including revolving Indebtedness) or otherwise invest such Net
Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph within the applicable time period will be
deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Within ten
Business Days after the expiration of the applicable time period, or at such earlier date that the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture exceeds the greater of €140 million and 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of
Senior Secured Notes issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and, to the extent the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase
(or, if applicable, repay or prepay) the maximum aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes
and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be
purchased (or, if applicable, repaid or prepaid) out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect
of the Senior Secured Notes equal to or greater than 100% of the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes and at an offer price in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness of no more than 100%
of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus a premium over par no greater than the


-----

premium offered to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes in the Asset Disposition Offer, in each case
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (or, if applicable,
repayment or prepayment), in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior
to the expiration of the applicable time period referred to above.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the
Excess Proceeds, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general
corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer
by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds
the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased (or, if applicable, repaid or prepaid) on a pro rata
basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such
Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such
aggregate principal amounts into their euro equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are
denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the
net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is
actually received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer upon converting such portion into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a
period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer
_Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period_
(the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will purchase (or, if
applicable, repay or prepay) the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent
it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased (or, if applicable, repaid or prepaid)
pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent
lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes
and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the Euro Senior Secured Notes, and $200,000 and in integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the Dollar Senior Secured Notes. The Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Senior
Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in
accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of
the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Senior Secured Notes
an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for purchase,
and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will promptly issue a new Senior Secured Note (or amend the
Global Note), and the Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Senior Secured


-----

Notes Issuer, will authenticate (via an authenticating agent) and mail or deliver (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal
amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; provided that each
such new Euro Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum
denomination of €100,000 and each such new Dollar Senior Secured Notes will be in an aggregate
principal amount with a minimum denomination of $200,000. Any Senior Secured Note not so
accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to
be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer from the transferee that are converted by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each other
Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in
connection with such Asset Disposition; _provided that such Indebtedness is not, directly or_
indirectly, secured by any Lien on any of the assets or property of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer);

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Guarantor) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken
together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant
that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €85 million and 15.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA (in each case with the fair market value of each item of Designated NonCash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value); and

(6) any Capital Stock or assets of a kind referred to in clause (3)(c) of the first paragraph of this
covenant.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule
14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (or rules of any
exchange on which the Senior Secured Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of
Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this
covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**


-----

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including
the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with, or for the
benefit of, any Affiliate of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €55
million and 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that
could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of
the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not
such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €110 million and
20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority
of the members of the Board of Directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause_
(9)(b)(ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments”) or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in clauses_
(1)(b), (2) and (11) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, longterm incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee

provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of
Directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(or entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or
among Restricted Subsidiaries;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Parent (whether
directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such
directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and
any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of
or on the Issue Date (with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries as of
that date) (including, without limitation, any transactions described under the caption “Certain
_Relationships and Related Party Transactions” in the Offering Memorandum), as these_
agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or

refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent
not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect and the entry into and
performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in connection with any Public
Offering;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement
pursuant to which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is
required or permitted to file a consolidated tax return, or the formation and maintenance of any
consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary
course of business; provided that, in the case of a Tax Sharing Agreement, payments under such
Tax Sharing Agreement shall not exceed, and shall not be duplicative of, the amounts described
under clause (2) of the definition of the term “Related Taxes”;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in
each case, in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the
Senior Management of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or
are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time
from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
and any Affiliate of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would
constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar
entity;

members of the Board of Directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in their reasonable
determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any
Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture;

(11) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (12) hereof and so long as no

commitments existing on, the date of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation;

(15) transactions in which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, delivers to the Trustee a letter or opinion from an Independent Financial Advisor stating
that (i) the terms are not materially less favorable to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its
relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that would have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an
unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis or (ii) that the transaction is fair to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view;

(16) pledges of Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary that secure Indebtedness of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary; and

(17) the Incurrence of any Senior Notes Proceeds Loan and the performance of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s obligations thereunder, including payment obligations, in compliance with the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall
provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Senior Notes Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2023, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following
information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Senior Notes Issuer as of the end of the
two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash
flow of the Senior Notes Issuer for the two most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes
to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements;
(b) unaudited _pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of the_
Senior Notes Issuer (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full
income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year; provided that such pro
_forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable_
expense, in which case the Senior Notes Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financials; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity
and capital resources of the Senior Notes Issuer, and a discussion of material commitments and
contingencies and critical accounting policies, with a similar scope to that included in the
Offering Memorandum; (d) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the
Senior Notes Issuer, all material Affiliate Transactions and a description of all material
contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; (e) a description of material risk
factors and material recent developments (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not require
disclosure of confidential negotiations (as determined in good faith by the Senior Notes Issuer));
and (f) a summary description of any material differences in the information reported by the
Senior Notes Issuer with respect to items (a) to (e) above and the corresponding information of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (which summary description need not be audited and will not


-----

include a line-item by line-item reconciliation between financial information of the Senior Notes
Issuer and the corresponding financial information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer);

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first and third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the
Senior Notes Issuer and within 75 days following the end of the second fiscal quarter in each
fiscal year of the Senior Notes Issuer, beginning with the period ending September 30, 2023, all
quarterly reports of the Senior Notes Issuer containing the following information: (a) an unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period
ending on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet date, and the comparable prior
year periods, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited _pro forma income_
statement information and balance sheet information of the Senior Notes Issuer (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to
the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the
relevant quarter; provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the
extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Senior Notes Issuer will
provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (c) an operating and
financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of
operations, financial condition, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources
of the Senior Notes Issuer, and a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary course of
business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent report; (d) material recent
developments (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not require disclosure of confidential
negotiations (as determined in good faith by the Senior Notes Issuer)); and (e) a summary
description of any material differences in the information reported by the Senior Notes Issuer with
respect to items (a) to (d) above and the corresponding information of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer (which summary description need not be audited and will not include a line-item by lineitem reconciliation between financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer and the
corresponding financial information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer); and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any
senior executive officer changes at the Senior Notes Issuer or change in auditors of the Senior
Notes Issuer or any other material event that the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent
basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3)
above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied
to such periods. All pro forma financial information shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
accounting policies of the Senior Notes Issuer (or other reporting entity, as applicable). Except as
provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the
Senior Notes Issuer. The filing of an Annual Report on Form 20-F within the time period specified in
clause (1) will satisfy such provision.

At any time that any of the Senior Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any
such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one
Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer, then the annual and
quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant
shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements
or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Senior Notes
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of
the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited
financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries
(as a group or otherwise) together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the
Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following items:


-----

revenue, EBITDA, profit (loss) for the year, cash, total assets, long term borrowings and other
financial liabilities, total equity, capital expenditures and interest expenses.

All reports provided pursuant to this covenant shall be made in the English language or with a free
English translation. So long as Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
will, in connection with delivery of the annual and quarterly reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of
the first paragraph of this covenant, hold a conference call to discuss such reports and the results of
operations for the relevant reporting period.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2)
and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall also (a) use its
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on such website as may be then
maintained by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide
substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer determines in good faith that
it cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to
applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the
Holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the
equity securities of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity are listed on a
Recognized Stock Exchange and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is
subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to
trading on such Recognized Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is, or would be, required to file with such Recognized Stock
Exchange. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and _provided that such requirements_
require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual and
semi-annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the Recognized Stock Exchange,
as applicable, and _provided, further, that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, such Parent or such IPO_
Entity, as applicable, additionally provides the reports set forth in clause (2) above with respect to its
first and third fiscal quarters, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with
the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. “Recognized Stock Exchange” means a
regulated market operated by any of Euronext, the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, the London
Stock Exchange (including, for the avoidance of doubt, AIM and Main Market listings) or such other
similar regulated securities exchange.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may satisfy its obligations and the requirements of this covenant
with respect to financial information relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by furnishing
financial information relating to any Parent consolidating reporting at its level in a manner consistent
with that described in this covenant; _provided that such financial information is accompanied by_
consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information
relating to such Parent and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand. At the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
election, for any relevant reporting period, the financial statements, information, auditors’ reports and
other documents or information required to be provided as described in the preceding paragraphs of
this“—Reports” covenant, may be, rather than those of the Senior Notes Issuer, those of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer itself.

In addition, so long as the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding and during any period during
which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor
exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall furnish to the
Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes, the information
required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports”
covenant is for information purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual


-----

or constructive notice of any information contained therein, include the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
compliance with any of its covenants under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer
or lease all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person (the “Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or the United States of
America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of
Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer (if not the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and
delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Security Documents
(and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Additional Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Senior
Secured Notes Issuer as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Senior Secured Notes
Issuer would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of
the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Successor
Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which the transaction is
consummated would not be less than the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture (if any are required in connection with such transaction) comply with the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and
binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in each case,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion
of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to
satisfaction of clauses (2) and (3) above.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer instead of such
Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

The Successor Senior Secured Notes Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise
every right and power of, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
(with the release of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer from any and all obligations thereunder) but in


-----

the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released
from its obligations under such Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below under “—
_Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence) and, other than with_
respect to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant, any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with,
merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to
in this sentence), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge
into or transfer all or a portion of its assets to an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of
changing the legal domicile of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, reincorporating the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.
Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to
in this sentence), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge
into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any Guarantor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) will not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that
becomes a Parent of one or more of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries.

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially
as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless:

(a) the other Person is the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with the transaction;

(b) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the
Guarantor under its Senior Secured Note Guarantee and the Security Documents (and, to
the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Additional Intercreditor Agreement); and
immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of
the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary under this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant, (a)
any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or
part of its properties and assets to a Guarantor or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and (b) any
Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to any other Guarantor or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Notwithstanding
anything else to the contrary under this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant, a Guarantor may


-----

consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the
purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor, reincorporating the Guarantor in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Guarantor. For the avoidance of doubt, any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than a Guarantor) may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other such Restricted Subsidiary.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

This “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant will not apply to any transaction or arrangement
pursuant to (i) any Permitted Reorganization or (ii) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
another Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in order to comply with any law,
rule, regulation or order, recommendation or direction of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority
having jurisdiction over the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade
Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”),
then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to such Senior
Secured Notes: “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—
_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate_
_Transactions,” “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Additional Guarantees,”_
and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer,” and, in each case, any related default provision of_
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and their respective Restricted Subsidiaries. Such
covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first
day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any
effect with regard to actions of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer or their
respective Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and
the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since
the date of such Senior Secured Notes Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have
occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the
Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be
classified, at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to clause (1)
or (2) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of
the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would
be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to
Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the
extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred under the first two paragraphs of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to
have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual
commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to
have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the
Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Secured Notes no longer having an Investment
Grade Status.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the Holders that the two conditions set
forth in the first paragraph under this heading have been satisfied, provided that such notification shall


-----

not be a condition for the suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee
shall not be obligated to notify Holders of such event.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an investment
grade rating.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to Guarantee any Public Debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Guarantor, and, in each case, any refinancing thereof Incurred by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Guarantor in whole or in part (which refinancing in turn consists of Public Debt), unless (subject to
the Agreed Security Principles) such Non-Guarantor Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on
which such other Guarantee or other Indebtedness, as applicable, is Incurred and, if applicable,
executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Senior Secured
Note Guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes, which Senior Secured Note Guarantee will be senior to
or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

A Non-Guarantor Subsidiary may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to which
such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Senior Secured Note Guarantee of the Senior Secured
Notes.

Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or
other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not be obligated to cause such
Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes to the extent the Agreed Security
Principles so provide or to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Senior Secured Note
Guarantee could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable law
or regulation; (2) any liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such
partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other
than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses Incurred in connection
with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause
(1) of this paragraph undertaken in connection with, such Senior Secured Note Guarantee, which in
any case under any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph cannot be avoided through measures
reasonably available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; or (4) an
inconsistency with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_No Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, and the
Senior Notes Issuer shall not, take or omit to take any action that would have the result of materially
impairing any security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence
of Permitted Collateral Liens, the implementation of any Permitted Reorganization and the repayment
or amendment of intragroup Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and their respective Subsidiaries in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair any security interest with respect to the Collateral) for
the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not, and shall not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, and the Senior Notes Issuer shall not grant to any Person other


-----

than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries
described in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, any Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant entitled “—
_Limitation on Liens”; provided that the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and their_
respective Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be
discharged, transferred or released in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the applicable Security
Documents.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any
security interest in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Subject to the foregoing, the
Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified or released (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets or, in the case of a Permitted Reorganization, assets with substantially
similar value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or Senior Management of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer) to the Lien that was in place immediately prior to such release) to (i)
cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral
Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; or (iv) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect
the Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause (iv) above, except
where permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by a substantially concurrent
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless contemporaneously with
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement or modification or release (followed by
a substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, any of (1) a solvency
opinion from an Independent Financial Advisor which confirms the solvency of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by a
substantially concurrent retaking of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (2) a
certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which
confirms the solvency of the Person granting such security interest after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
release (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over
the same assets) or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of
Opinion of Counsel) confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by a
substantially concurrent retaking of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien
or Liens created under the Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, modified or released and replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject
to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens
were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or release and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted
Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the
requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary
protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from
the Holders.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture:


-----

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60
days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30%
in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with its other agreements
contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced by any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness
owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of any grace period provided in such Indebtedness
(“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
aggregate principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment
default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates the greater of €110 million and
20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of €110 million and
20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA (in each case exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance
company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for
a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral shall, at any time, cease to
be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security
Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of the
greater of €30 million and 5.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the release or
amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or such Security
Document or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in
writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues
for ten days (the “security default provisions”); and


-----

(8) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary or a group of Guarantors that when taken together (as
of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary,
ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Guarantee,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor
denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and any such Default continues
for ten days (the “guarantee provisions”).

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event
of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes notify the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of the default and, with respect to
clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer does not cure such default within the
time specified in clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such
notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall,
declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional
Amounts, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration,
such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will
be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured
Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the
declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of
default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall have been
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to
such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of
acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured
Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all
existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of
the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the
Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default
(except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any)
and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if
an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any
of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of
the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by
way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce
the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;


-----

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of
pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of such indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding); and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent
with such request within such 60 day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Trustee. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event
of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, has occurred and
is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a
prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to
follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in
personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee
will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) reasonably
satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a
responsible officer of the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so
long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is
in the interests of the Holders. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee,
within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the
signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Senior Secured Notes
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence of a Default or an
Event of Default, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default or
an Event of Default, their status and what action the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is taking or proposes
to take in respect thereof. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs
for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”)
then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required
certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii)
any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the
covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate
pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured
upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable,
even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

The Senior Secured Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to
the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take
action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action
directly.


-----

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the
Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce
the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, such Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any
default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Senior
Secured Notes).

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes affected (provided, however, that if any amendment,
supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect the Euro Senior Secured Notes or
the Dollar Senior Secured Notes, only the consent of the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Euro Senior Secured Notes or Dollar Senior Secured Notes
will be required), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such series of the Senior
Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior
Secured Note;

(3) reduce the principal of, or extend the Stated Maturity of, any such Senior Secured Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Secured Note or change the
time at which any such Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above
under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any such Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in such Senior
Secured Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of, and interest on, such Holder’s
Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of
any such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, a payment required by the provisions described above under “—Change of
_Control” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”);_

(7) make any change in the provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described under “—
_Withholding Taxes” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in_
any material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result
in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any
obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay
Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release (i) all or substantially all of the Collateral granted for the benefit of the Holders or (ii) any
Senior Secured Note Guarantee, in each case, other than pursuant to the terms of the Security
Documents and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or except as permitted by the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;


-----

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
the Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement
any Note Document to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Senior Secured Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Guarantor under any of the documents referenced above;

(3) provide for uncertificated Senior Secured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Senior
Secured Notes (provided that the uncertificated Senior Secured Notes are issued in registered
form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code);

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the legal rights of any Holder in any material
respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to add_
Collateral for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, to allow any Guarantor to execute a
supplemental indenture and/or a Guarantee with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or to
confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien
(including the Collateral and the Security Documents) with respect to or securing the Senior
Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Note Documents of a
successor Trustee and/or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the
accession by the Trustee and/or Security Agent to any Note Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties to the Senior Facilities Agreement,
in any property which is required by the Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the Issue
Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit
of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—No
_Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the
transfer and legending of Senior Secured Notes as permitted by the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and administration of the Senior


-----

Secured Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
as so amended would not result in Senior Secured Notes being transferred in violation of the
Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not materially and
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior Secured Notes; or

(11) to release the security interests created by the Security Documents or any Guarantees as provided
by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such evidence as it
deems appropriate including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent
approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a
tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to effect an amendment authorized by clause (4) above in
respect of providing for a Guarantee for the benefit of Holders, the supplemental indenture providing
for the accession of such Guarantor shall be duly authorized and executed by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, such additional Guarantor and the Trustee (and no other party).

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described under “—
_Certain Covenants,” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders of the Senior Secured_
Notes to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Senior Secured Notes.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, any Senior Secured Notes owned by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or
under direct or indirect common control with, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be disregarded and
deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at any time may terminate all its and any Guarantor’s obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure
all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those
respecting the defeasance trust (as defined below), the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registrations of Senior
Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing,
if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents in
effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantor’s obligations under
the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2)
of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior
_Secured Notes Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such_
covenants described under _“—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a_
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the
guarantee provisions and the security default provisions described under “—Events of Default” above
(“covenant defeasance”).


-----

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option
notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. If the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default
specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer”), (4), (5), (6)
(other than with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of
_Default” above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must irrevocably
deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as
agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government
Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the
Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, _provided, that upon any_
redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium with respect to the Euro Senior
Secured Notes, and the Dollar Senior Secured Notes, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for
purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the
Trustee equal to such Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with
any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only
required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously
with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium
Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption, and in order to exercise either defeasance option, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the Senior Secured Notes
will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such
deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in
the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and
defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in
the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change
in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or
is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940;
and

(5) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information
that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security
Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of
conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes, as expressly provided for in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the


-----

Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or
destroyed Senior Secured Notes and certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer)
have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not
previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will
become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;
(2) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such
entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), euros or euro-denominated
European Government Obligations or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient to pay and
discharge without consideration of reinvestment the entire indebtedness on the Euro Senior Secured
Notes and the Dollar Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation,
for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes
that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be;
(3) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture; (4) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to apply the deposited money
toward payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may
be; and (5) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge” section of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of_
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and
releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.
The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of
Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will
perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Senior Secured Notes Indenture. During
the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise the rights and powers vested in it under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use
in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action enumerated in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or
duty.

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be
removed, and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at
any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured
Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and (2)
that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or (b)
becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Senior Secured


-----

Notes Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less
than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for
any loss, liability and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its
part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Senior Secured Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or
mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes,
if any, maintained by the Registrar. Alternatively, all notices to Holders of Senior Secured Notes will
be validly given if disseminated through the newswire service of Bloomberg (or if Bloomberg does
not operate, any similar agency) or published in a leading English language daily newspaper
published in London or, if such publication is not reasonably practicable, in such other English
language daily newspaper with general circulation in Europe as the Trustee may approve. It is
expected that any such publication will normally be made in the Financial Times.

In addition, for so long as any of the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the Exchange shall so require, notices with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes will be posted on the official website of the Exchange. In addition, for so
long as any Senior Secured Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the
Senior Secured Notes will be delivered to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be
deemed to satisfy the requirements of the preceding paragraph, each of which will give such notices to
the holders of Book-Entry Interests. Such notices may also be published on the website of the
Exchange, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Exchange.

Each such notice, including without limitation through the newswire service of Bloomberg (or if
Bloomberg does not operate, any similar agency) shall be deemed to have been given on the date of
such publication or, if published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which
publication is made; _provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been_
given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or
communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first class mail or other
equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time
prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its
sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner
provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given via DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is
given to DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or
premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due
date for payment thereof. Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor for the
payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due
date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro, with respect to the Euro Senior Secured Notes, and U.S. dollar, with respect to the Dollar Senior
Secured Notes, are the required currencies (each, a “Required Currency”) of account and payment for


-----

all sums payable by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, under or in
connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, if any, including
damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the applicable Required
Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Guarantor or
otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the amount of the applicable Required
Currency which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that
other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase
on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If the amount of the applicable Required Currency is less than the amount of the Required Currency
expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or
the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will
indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such
purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the
matter stated therein for the Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (indicating the sources of information used)
the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and
independent obligation from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations,
will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver
granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities
set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or
proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Secured Note or any Senior
Secured Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
euro-denominated restriction herein, the euro-equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a significant portion of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are held outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if
any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or the
Senior Secured Note Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States. See “Service of
_Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”_

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and any Guarantor will in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of
New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, including any Senior Secured
Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder will be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements will be governed by English law.

accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or groups of assets that constitute an operating
unit or division of a business (and ownership interests therein) disposed of on or prior to the

day of the four fiscal quarter reference period, but only to the extent that the obligations giving
rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on the Calculation
Date will be deemed to have been a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer at
all times during the four fiscal quarter reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on the
Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer at any time during the four fiscal quarter reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and such Indebtedness is to be given pro forma
effect, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire four fiscal quarter reference period
(taking into account any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging
Obligation has a remaining term as at the Calculation Date in excess of twelve months, or, if
shorter, at least equal to the remaining term of such Indebtedness); and

(7) interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably
determined by a responsible financial or accounting Officer of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to
be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS.

Taxes, Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Net Income, calculations will be as
determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting Officer of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer.

“Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage” means the sum of the aggregate outstanding Senior Secured
Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (excluding Hedging
Obligations permitted by clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”)._

“Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio” means, as of any date of determination, the ratio
of (x)(i) Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage minus cash and Cash Equivalents at such date and (ii)
the Reserved Indebtedness Amount secured by a Lien on the Collateral and not contractually
subordinated to obligations under the Senior Secured Notes or Note Guarantees as of such date to (y)
the Consolidated EBITDA of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. For the avoidance of doubt, in
determining the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, no cash proceeds of Senior Secured
Indebtedness in respect of which the calculation of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio is to be made shall be included.

In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Subsidiary Incurs, repays, repurchases,
redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness (other than ordinary working capital
borrowings) subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the date on which the event for
which the calculation of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is made (for the purpose


-----

of this definition, the “Calculation Date”) (but not giving effect to (i) any Indebtedness Incurred on
the Calculation Date pursuant to the second paragraph under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” other than clause (5)(b) of such second paragraph or (ii) the repayment,_
repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge of any Indebtedness on the Calculation Date, to
the extent that such repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge is made with
the proceeds of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”), then the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio_
will be calculated giving pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or
accounting Officer of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) to such Incurrence, repayment, repurchase,
redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as
if the same had occurred on the first day of the four fiscal quarter reference period.

For purposes of calculating the Consolidated EBITDA for such period:

(1) Purchases, including all related financing transactions and including increases in ownership of
any Restricted Subsidiary, during the four fiscal quarter reference period or subsequent to such
reference period and on or prior to the Calculation Date (including transactions giving rise to the
need to calculate such Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio) will be given pro forma
effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting Officer of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and may include anticipated cost synergies and cost savings) as if the same
had occurred on the first day of the four fiscal quarter reference period; provided that, if definitive
documentation has been entered into with respect to any Purchase that is part of the transaction
causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be
calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Purchase (including anticipated cost synergies and
cost savings) as if such Purchase had occurred on the first day of such period, even if the Purchase
has not yet been consummated as of the date of determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance
with IFRS, and operations, businesses or groups of assets that constitute an operating unit or
division of a business (and ownership interests therein) disposed of on or prior to the Calculation
Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if the same had occurred on the first day of the four
fiscal quarter reference period;

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in
accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or groups of assets that constitute an operating
unit or division of a business (and ownership interests therein) disposed of on or prior to the
Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if the same had occurred on the first
day of the four fiscal quarter reference period, but only to the extent that the obligations giving
rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on the Calculation
Date will be deemed to have been a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer at
all times during the four fiscal quarter reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on the
Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during the
four fiscal quarter reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and such Indebtedness is to be given pro forma
effect, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire four fiscal quarter reference period
(taking into account any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging
Obligation has a remaining term as at the Calculation Date in excess of twelve months, or, if
shorter, at least equal to the remaining term of such Indebtedness); and


-----

(7) interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably
determined by a responsible financial or accounting Officer of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to
be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Income
Taxes, Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Net Income, calculations will be as
determined in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer.

principal amount of Capitalized Lease Obligations, Purchase Money Obligations and unreimbursed
drawings under letters of credit of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
outstanding on such date minus (c) the aggregate amount of cash and Cash Equivalents (which may
include any cash that collateralizes guarantee or letter of credit facilities of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
as of the determination date, in each case, with such pro forma adjustments as are consistent with the
_pro forma adjustments set forth in the definition of “Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.” For_
the avoidance of doubt, Consolidated Total Net Indebtedness shall exclude Indebtedness (i) in respect
of any Hedging Obligations and Qualified Receivables Financing and (ii) any Guarantees by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries of any Senior Notes permitted to be
Incurred under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the extent an equal or greater aggregate amount
of Indebtedness in respect of any Senior Notes Proceeds Loan outstanding on the relevant date of
determination is included in this definition of Consolidated Total Net Indebtedness.

“Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio” means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (1)(i)

consistent with the pro forma adjustments set forth in the definition of “Consolidated Fixed Charge
_Coverage Ratio”;_ _provided, however, that the_ _pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (x) any_
Indebtedness Incurred on such determination date pursuant to the provisions described in the second
paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to clause 5(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or (y) the discharge on such determination date of any_
Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the
provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” (other than Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (5) of the second paragraph of the_
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”).

therefor;

(2) to advance or supply funds:

###### BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM 

**General**

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule
144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Rule
144A Global Notes representing the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes”) will be
deposited upon issuance with the custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as
nominee of DTC. On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Notes representing the Euro Notes (the
“Euro Rule 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary (the
“Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of
the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Each series of Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in
reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and,
together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Regulation S
Global Notes representing the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar Regulation S Global Notes” and, together
with the Dollar 144A Global Notes, the “Dollar Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with
the custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. On the Issue
Date, the Regulation S Global Notes representing the Euro Notes (the “Euro Regulation S Global
Notes” and, together with the Euro Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Euro Global Notes”) will be
deposited upon issuance with the Common Depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and in
the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Restricted Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have
accounts with DTC, in the case of the Dollar Global Notes, and Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the
case of the Euro Global Notes, or persons who hold interests through such participants or otherwise in
accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture and any applicable securities
laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their respective
participants, as applicable. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will only be issued in minimum
denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the
Dollar Global Notes) and minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof (in the case of the Euro Global Notes).

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems
a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of
securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing
limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while
the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Notes registered in
their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certified form (subject to very limited
exceptions) and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the custodian for DTC or the Common Depositary for
Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered to be
the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely
on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants
must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants


-----

through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of
holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Registrar, the relevant Paying Agent, the relevant Transfer
Agent, the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any
aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes if:

    - DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to
continue to act as depositary for the Global Notes, and we fail to appoint a successor; or

    - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
either DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under
the Indenture.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a BookEntry Interest, their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issues or causes to be issued Notes
in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names
of the owner(s) of the Book-Entry Interest and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or
on behalf of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective
customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial
ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive
legend set forth in “Notice to Investors,” unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or
applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the relevant Paying Agent, the Registrar and
the relevant Transfer Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the
absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.
Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the
registered office of the Issuer or as otherwise provided in the Indenture, and such registration is a
means of evidencing title to the Notes.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for
a period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii)
any date fixed for redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be
redeemed in part. The Issuer is also not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes
selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in
connection with a change of control offer or asset sale offer. In the event of the transfer of any
Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among others, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. The Issuer may require a holder
to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are
mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the relevant Transfer Agent, we will
issue and the Trustee (or its appointed agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered
Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting
replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment
of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee, the relevant Paying Agent and the Registrar
appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive


-----

Registered Note is replaced. We may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered
Note.

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay,
redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to
the relevant Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect
that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to
_Investors.”_

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the BookEntry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of
such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such BookEntry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We
understand that, under existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, if fewer than all the
Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit their respective
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on
such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective operational
procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $200,000 principal amount
(in the case of the Dollar Global Notes) and €100,000 principal amount (in the case of the Euro
Global Notes) at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any,
interest and additional interest, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the relevant Paying Agent, which
will in turn make such payments to DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, which will
distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer
expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by
participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the relevant Transfer Agent
and the relevant Paying Agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., DTC,
Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable) as the owners thereof for
the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the
Guarantors, the Trustee, the Registrar, the relevant Transfer Agent or the relevant Paying Agent or
any of our or their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a BookEntry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

    - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant; or

    - the records of the custodian or Common Depositary, as applicable.


-----

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors,
the Trustee, the relevant Paying Agent, the relevant Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Initial
Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or
any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any
currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be
subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Dollar Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S. dollars.
The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Euro Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or
Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes
are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to
which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any
other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes,
each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserves the right
to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive
Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and
procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants,
which rules and procedures may change from time to time. If a holder of Notes requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that
require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must
transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144A under the Securities Act or any other exemption (if available) under the
Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.”
Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book

-----

Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note
for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a BookEntry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note
for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required,
only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer
restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are
provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the
control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. None of us, the
Trustee, the relevant Paying Agent, the Registrar, the relevant Transfer Agent or the Initial Purchaser
take any responsibility for these operations or procedures.

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement
system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer,
the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the relevant Paying Agent, the relevant Transfer
Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those operations or
procedures and we urge investors to contact the relevant settlement systems or their participants
directly to discuss these matters.

DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York
Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a
member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New
York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of
Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and
non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that
DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among
direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic
computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the
holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its
regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and
non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, they also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide
various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.


-----

Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear
and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to
pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream
systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite
certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical
delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to
such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only
through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective clearing system’s
rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes, they are under no obligation to perform or continue
to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None
of the us, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the relevant Transfer Agent, the
Registrar, the relevant Paying Agent nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable or will
have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or
indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Dollar Notes will be made in U.S. dollars and initial settlement for the Euro
Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on
the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream and will
settle in same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s
accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and
other communications involving the Notes through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream on days when
those systems are open for business. In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be
complications with completing transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same
business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or
to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions
will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or in Brussels
if Euroclear is used.


-----

**Clearing Information**

We expect that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream. The ISIN numbers and common codes or CUSIP numbers for the Notes are set forth
under “Listing and General Information—Clearing Information.”

###### CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS 

_If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor as to the possible tax_
_consequences of purchasing, holding or selling any Notes under the laws of your country of_
_citizenship, residence or domicile, including the effect of any local taxes applicable to you. The_
_discussions that follow do not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations that_
_may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell Notes. In particular, these discussions do not_
_consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to you. The discussions that follow for_
_each jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof as in effect as of the_
_date of this offering memorandum. These tax laws and interpretations are subject to change, possibly_
_with retroactive or retrospective effect._

**Certain General Tax Considerations—Payments by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of the Notes, it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under the
provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption that may apply.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax
effects. This summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except
for the discussion under “—Tax Return Disclosure Requirements—Foreign Account Tax Compliance
_Act,” and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax_
laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This summary deals
only with Notes that are held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), by a U.S.
holder who acquires the Notes pursuant to this Offering for cash at the price indicated on the cover
page of this offering memorandum.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

- an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;

- an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source;
or

- a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or
more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a
valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”)
to be treated as a U.S. person.

This summary is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including provisions of the Code, the
Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this
offering memorandum, all of which are subject to change at any time. Changes in such rules, or new
interpretations thereof, may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect the U.S. federal
income tax consequences described below. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the
IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary and
there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or
that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. A tax treatment of


-----

the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes different from those discussed below could
adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment
in the Notes.

This summary is general in nature and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal taxation
or all tax considerations that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of its particular circumstances.
In addition, it does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are
subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does
not address any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences or tax consequences to:

- holders who are dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the markto-market method of accounting for their securities, banks, financial institutions, individual
retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities and investors in such
entities, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;

- holders who are members of an “expanded group” with the Issuer within the meaning of the
Treasury Regulations under Code Section 385;

- persons holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or conversion
transaction, or a straddle;

- U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

- U.S. expatriates or entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules;

- persons who are not U.S. holders;

- persons who are resident in France or any other jurisdiction other than the United States or who
have a taxable presence therein;

- holders of the outstanding Existing Senior Secured Notes that will be redeemed using the
proceeds of this Offering;

- persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect
to the notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement (as defined in section
451 of the Code);

- tax consequences associated with the base erosion and anti-abuse tax; or

- alternative minimum tax consequences or tax consequences of the 3.8% Medicare tax on net
investment income.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes and are considering an investment in the Notes, or if you are a partner in such a
partnership, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.


-----

**The following discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations is for informational**
**purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. If you are considering**
**the purchase of Notes, you should consult your own tax advisor concerning the particular U.S.**
**federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes,**
**as well as the consequences to you arising under any other tax laws, under the laws of any other**
**taxing jurisdiction or due to changes in tax law.**

This summary assumes that the Notes will be treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

**IPO Pushdown**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described under “Description
_of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements—Provisions Following an IPO”), pursuant to_
which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically
operate so that, amongst other things, the Senior Secured Group (and all related provisions) will now
refer to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from all obligations under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security). Such a
modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place
after such modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a
deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
which certain beneficial owners of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss (although any
such loss could be disallowed or subject to significant limitations). The amount of any gain or loss
recognized upon such a deemed exchange of a Note for a New Note would be determined by
reference to the “issue price” of the New Note. The issue price of a New Note will equal the fair
market value of such Note or such New Note at the time of the deemed exchange if, as seems likely,
such Note or such New Note were considered “publicly traded” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If the IPO Pushdown is treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.
holder’s holding period in a New Note treated as received in the IPO Pushdown generally will
commence on the day after the IPO Pushdown, and tax basis in such New Note would generally equal
the issue price of such New Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized as a result of such deemed
exchange will be taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement,
_Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes—U.S. Holders of Dollar Notes” and “—Sale,_
_Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes—U.S. Holders of Euro_
_Notes.” If the issue price of such New Note is less than its stated redemption price at maturity by more_
than a de minimis amount, such New Note will be treated as issued with original issue discount for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. holders would be required to include that
original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to
such income. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax
considerations relating to modification of the Notes in connection with the IPO Pushdown, including
the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting original issue
discount, if any.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from
payments on the Notes (as described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”) or make
additional payments in redemption of the Notes in addition to their stated principal amount and
accrued interest (as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”). Although the
issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paying such
additional amounts, or making additional payments in redemption of the Notes, does not result in the
Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury
Regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the


-----

issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or
incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations.

Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S.
holder, unless the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which
such U.S. holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not
binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. holder may be
required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its
method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt
instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of
the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the
Notes generally would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. holder should consult its
own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt
instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments.

**_Interest—U.S. Holders of Dollar Notes_**

It is anticipated, and this discussion assumes, that the Dollar Notes will not be issued with original
issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such a case, interest on a Dollar Note
(including any non-U.S. taxes withheld from payments thereof and any additional amounts paid in
respect of such withholding taxes) generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the
time it is received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

**_Interest—U.S. Holders of Euro Notes_**

It is anticipated, and this discussion assumes, that the Euro Notes will not be issued with original issue
discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such a case, interest on a Euro Note (including any
non-U.S. taxes withheld from payments thereof and any additional amounts paid in respect of such
withholding taxes) generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time it is
received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. holder of a Euro Note that receives an interest
payment in foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the
exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted
into U.S. dollars. No foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the
receipt of such payment (other than foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition
of the euros so received; see “—Disposition of Foreign Currency”).

An accrual basis U.S. holder of a Euro Note may determine the amount of income recognized with
respect to an interest payment denominated in foreign currency in accordance with either of two
methods. Under the first method, the amount of interest income accrued will be based on the average
exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that
spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year).

Under the second method, the U.S. holder of a Euro Note may elect to determine the amount of
income accrued on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in
the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day
of the part of the period within the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually
received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S.
holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the
day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder at
the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S.
holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.


-----

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or other disposition of a Euro Note)
denominated in foreign currency, an accrual basis U.S. holder of a Euro Note may recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between
the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date of receipt) in respect
of an accrual period and the amount previously accrued during such accrual period (as described
above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss
generally will constitute U.S. source gain or loss.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income (including any additional amounts) on a Note generally will constitute foreign
source income and generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign
tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding
tax with respect to the Notes held by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be
eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. There are significant limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits
(including requirements under recent U.S. Treasury regulations that a withholding tax must constitute
a “covered withholding tax” imposed on nonresidents in lieu of a generally applicable tax that
satisfies the regulatory definition of an “income tax,” which may be unclear or difficult to determine).
The rules governing the calculation of foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a U.S. holder’s
particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or
deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes—U.S. Holders of_**
**_Dollar Notes_**

If a U.S. holder of a Dollar Note sells, exchanges or otherwise disposes of a Dollar Note, or if a Dollar
Note that such holder holds is retired or redeemed, such holder generally will recognize gain or loss
equal to the difference between the amount realized on the transaction (less any amount attributable to
accrued but unpaid interest that such holder has not previously included in income, which amount will
be taxable as interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as
described above) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Dollar Note. The adjusted tax basis
of a Dollar Note to a U.S. holder will generally be the purchase price of such Dollar Note.

Any gain or loss that a U.S. holder recognizes on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Dollar Note
generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss
if such holder has held the Dollar Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term
capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) generally are eligible for reduced
rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes—U.S. Holders of_**
**_Euro Notes_**

If a U.S. holder sells, exchanges or otherwise disposes of a Euro Note, or if a Euro Note that such
holder holds is retired or redeemed, such holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference between the amount realized on the transaction (less any amount attributable to accrued but
unpaid interest that such holder has not previously included in income, which amount will be taxable
as interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above)
and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Euro Note. The adjusted tax basis of a Euro Note to a
U.S. holder will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot
rate of exchange on the date of purchase. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note, the amount realized
generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate of
exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Euro Note that is considered to be traded on an
established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder,
will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot


-----

rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual
basis U.S. holders in regard to the sale or other disposition of Euro Notes traded on an established
securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder and
cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make
the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate
fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will
constitute ordinary income or loss.

Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, any gain or loss
that a U.S. holder recognizes on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Euro Note generally will be U.S.
source capital gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if such holder has held
the Euro Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of noncorporate U.S. holders (including individuals) generally are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Euro Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal
amount of such Euro Note generally will be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S.
source income, respectively, and generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and not be
treated as interest income or expense. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of a Euro Note is the
U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Euro Note. Gain or loss attributable to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Euro Note
generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of
the Euro Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder disposes of the Euro Note and
(ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Euro Note, determined at the spot rate on the
date the U.S. holder purchased such Euro Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note, a U.S. holder may realize exchange gain or loss
attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued interest, which will be treated as discussed
under “—Interest—U.S. Holders of Euro Notes.” However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note, a U.S. holder will realize any foreign currency
exchange gain or loss (including with respect to principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest)
only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.

**_Disposition of Foreign Currency_**

Euros received as interest on a Euro Note or on the sale, exchange, redemption or retirement of a Euro
Note will have a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value at the time the foreign currency is received.

The amount of gain or loss recognized on a sale or other disposition of such euros will be equal to the
difference between (i) the amount of U.S. dollars, or the fair market value in U.S. dollars of the other
property received in such sale or other disposition and (ii) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such
euros. As discussed above, if the Euro Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash
basis U.S. holder (or an electing accrual basis holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the euros
by translating the euros received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or
the disposition. A U.S. holder that purchases a Euro Note with previously owned euros will generally
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between such U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in such euros and the U.S. dollar fair market value of such Euro Note on the date of
purchase.

Any such gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source and will be ordinary income or loss and
will not be treated as interest income or expense. The conversion of U.S. dollars to euros and the
immediate use of such euros to purchase a Euro Note generally will not result in any exchange gain or
loss for a U.S. holder.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code intended to require the reporting to the IRS of certain tax
shelter transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain
foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount (for
example, in the case of an individual or a trust, this loss threshold is currently set at $50,000 in any
single year), such as the receipt or accrual of interest or a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a
foreign currency note. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return
disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to
file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

Individuals and certain entities who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value
exceeding certain threshold amounts, generally are required to file an information report (IRS Form
8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified
foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in a financial
account at certain financial institutions. Prospective investors should consult with their own tax
advisors regarding the possible implications of these rules on their investment in the Notes.

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and stated interest
on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or
redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient (such as a
corporation), and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. The payor (which may be us
or an intermediate payor) will be required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%,
on such payments if: (i) the U.S. holder fails to furnish an accurate taxpayer identification number or
to establish an exemption from backup withholding; (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the taxpayer
identification number furnished by the U.S. holder is incorrect; (iii) there has been a “notified payee
underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the U.S. holder has not certified
under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number, that it is a
U.S. person, and that the IRS has not notified such U.S. holder that it is subject to backup withholding
under the Code.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be
credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability. You may obtain a refund of any excess
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for a
refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.

_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a
“foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru
payments” made after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of
applicable final regulations defining the term “foreign passthru payments” to the extent such
payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Obligations issued on or prior to
the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining
“foreign passthru payments” are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered”
and exempt from FATCA withholding unless such obligations are materially modified after such date.
As of the date of this offering memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been
filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a “foreign financial institution,” FATCA could apply to
payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income
tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Many non-U.S. governments
(including the government of France) have entered into, and others are expected to enter into,
intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the
rules described herein. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may
apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with


-----

respect to any payments on the Notes, there generally will be no additional amounts payable to
compensate for the withheld amount.

**Certain French Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain French withholding tax and transfer tax considerations
pertaining to the ownership and disposal of the Notes that may be relevant to holders that: (i) do not
hold their Notes in connection with a business or profession conducted in France through a permanent
establishment or a fixed base in France, (ii) do not hold shares of the Issuer, and (iii) are not related
parties of the Issuer within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code. Comments which
are included therein are reported only for information purposes and do not aim at giving a complete
analysis of the tax rules that may affect the Issuer, the Notes or the investors. Furthermore, this
summary does not address any French tax other than withholding tax and transfer tax and, in
particular, does not include estate or gift tax considerations. This summary is based on provisions of
French tax laws and regulations, as in force and applied by the French tax authorities on the date of
this offering memorandum, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect, or to
different interpretations. Accordingly, no opinion is expressed herein with regards to any system of
law other than the laws of France as applied by French courts as of the date of this offering
memorandum. Any investor contemplating to acquire the Notes should therefore consult its own tax
adviser about the tax consequences that may arise for it as a result of the acquisition, the ownership,
the disposal or the redemption of the Notes. It should be noted that Article 1649 AC of the French Tax
Code imposes on financial institutions within the meaning of Article 1 of Decree n°2016-1683 to
review and collect information on their clients and investors, in order to identify their tax residence, as
well as to provide certain account information to relevant foreign tax authorities on an annual basis.

**_Withholding Taxes on Payments Made Outside France_**

Payments of interest and assimilated revenues made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes will not be
subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code unless such
payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative state or territory (Etat ou territoire non
_coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (a “Non-Cooperative_
State”) other than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A,
irrespective of the holder’s fiscal domicile or registered headquarters. If such payments are made
outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2
bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code, a 75% withholding tax is applicable to such payments
(subject to certain exceptions and to the more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty)
by virtue of Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code. The list of Non-Cooperative States is published
by a ministerial executive order (arrêté) which is updated each year. The list was last updated on
February 3, 2023. Non-Cooperative States currently included on this list (other than those States or
territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code) are Anguilla,
Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, Panama, Seychelles, the Turks and Caicos Islands and Vanuatu.

Furthermore, according to the third and fourth paragraphs of Article 238 A of the French Tax Code,
interest and assimilated revenues with respect to the Notes will not be deductible from the Issuer’s
taxable result if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative
State or paid on an account held in a financial institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State
(the “Deductibility Exclusion”). Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and
assimilated revenues may be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et
seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case they may be subject to the withholding tax set out under
Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at (i) the 25% standard corporate income tax rate set forth
in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219-I of the French Tax Code for payments
benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents, (ii) a rate of 12.8% for payments benefiting
individuals who are not French tax residents or (iii) a rate of 75% for payments made outside France
in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French
Tax Code (in each case subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable provisions of an
applicable double tax treaty).


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the
French Tax Code nor, to the extent that the relevant interest and assimilated revenues relate to genuine
transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the Deductibility Exclusion and the
related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code that may be levied as a
result of such Deductibility Exclusion will apply in respect of the Notes if the Issuer can prove that
the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes was not that of locating the interest and
assimilated revenues in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”). Pursuant to the administrative
guidelines published by the French tax authorities regarding this legislation (BOI-INT-DG-20-50-30
dated 14/06/2022, § 150 and BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20 dated 06/06/2023, § 290 (the “BOFIP”)), the
Notes will benefit from the Exception without the Issuer having to provide any evidence supporting
the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes, and accordingly will be able to automatically
benefit from the Exception (the “Safe Harbour”), if the Notes are:

- offered by means of a public offering within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French
Monetary and Financial Code for which the publication of a prospectus is mandatory or pursuant
to an equivalent offer in a state other than a Non-Cooperative State (for this purpose, an
“equivalent offering” means any offering requiring the registration or submission of an offering
document by or with a foreign securities market authority); and/or

- admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or multilateral financial instruments
trading facility provided that such market or facility is not located in a Non-Cooperative State and
that such market is operated by a market operator, an investment services provider, or by such
other similar foreign entity that is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; and/or

- admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities
delivery and payment systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French
Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators
provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

The Notes issued by the Issuer under this offering memorandum qualify as debt securities under
French commercial law. To the extent that the Notes are (i) listed on the Official List of the Exchange
and (ii) admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, i.e., both securities delivery and payment systems operators within the meaning of Article
L. 561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code which are not located in a Non-Cooperative
State, payments made by the Issuer in respect of the Notes to their holders will fall under the Safe
Harbour and will thus not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the
French Tax Code, as construed by the French tax authorities under the BOFIP. Moreover, under the
same conditions, pursuant to the BOFIP and to the extent that the relevant interest and other
assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount,
interest and assimilated revenues paid by the Issuer on the Notes should not be subject to the
Deductibility Exclusion and, as a result, should not be subject to the withholding tax set out under
Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code solely on account of their being paid on an account held in a
financial institution established in a Non-Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established
or domiciled in a Non- Cooperative State.

Holders of the Notes who concurrently hold shares of the Issuer may also be impacted by other rules
not described in this section.

**Withholding Taxes on Payments Made to Individuals Fiscally Domiciled in France**

Pursuant to Article 125 A I of the French Tax Code, when the paying agent (établissement payeur) is
established in France and subject to certain exceptions, interest and similar income received by
individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France may be subject to a 12.8%
withholding tax, which is deductible from their personal income tax liability in respect of the year in
which the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and solidarity levy) are also
levied by way of withholding at an aggregate rate of 17.2% on such interest and similar income


-----

received by individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France, subject to certain
exceptions.

**Withholding Tax on disposal**

Pursuant to Article 244 bis C of the French Tax Code, beneficial owners of the Notes who are not
French residents and who do not hold their Notes in connection with a permanent establishment or a
fixed place of business in France should not be subject to withholding taxes in France in respect of the
gains realized on the sale, exchange, or disposal of the Notes.

**Transfer Tax**

No transfer taxes or similar duties are payable in France in connection with the transfer (sale, disposal
or redemption) of the Notes except in case of filing with the French tax authorities on a voluntary
basis and provided that the FTT does not become applicable.

###### CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS

_Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_security interests in some of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantees are or the Collateral is being_
_provided. It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be_
_initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of_
_the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over_
_which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights_
_and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests in the_
_Collateral._

**European Union**

_EU Insolvency Regulation_

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France, which is a Member
State of the European Union.

Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015, on
insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), as amended, in particular by
Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2018, published
in the Official Gazette of the European Union on July 6, 2018 (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) was
published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on June 5, 2015.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public
collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the
courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main
insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of
main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have
differing and even conflicting views.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency
proceedings is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to
Article 5, such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international
jurisdiction.

Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or “COMI” of
a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular
basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a
rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered
office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall apply only if the registered
office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period
prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be
possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State
other than that of its registered office, and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of
management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member
State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29,
2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of
factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the
location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location
where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept
and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have


-----

competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency
petition.

If a debtor’s COMI is, and will remain, located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it
has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU
Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex
A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under
the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than
Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to
commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has
an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member
State in the three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency
proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries
out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its
COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has
an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. Where main proceedings in the Member
State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the
EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another
Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot
be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member
State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor
whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the
territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a
public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which
the establishment is located. The effects of such territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of
the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main, secondary, or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject
to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court
that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to
Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of
which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have
jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked
with them, such as avoidance actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation
shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible,
moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole
that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another
Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

- the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the
proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

- the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of
the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

- the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or
use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and


-----

- a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States, so long
as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. Pursuant to article 21 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to
commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers
conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State subject to certain
limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State
or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence
insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. It may, in particular,
subject to the preservation of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to
Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other Member
State.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in
another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the
Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened, that the distribution of
those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the
distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary
insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in
writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in
accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on
the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at
the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such
proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local
creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and
its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not
exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local
creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a
request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to
three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency
proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the
process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the
secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Guarantors’ subsidiaries
experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the
security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides:

- for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency
proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the


-----

coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same
debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and (i) insolvency practitioners
and courts;

- for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the
efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming
part of the same group;

- that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and

- that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection
of such insolvency registers.

**_EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019, on
preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to
increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and
amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU
Restructuring Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that: (i) viable enterprises and
entrepreneurs that face financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring
frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted
entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of
time, thereby affording them a second chance; and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning
restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular, with a view to shortening
their length.

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of
restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive
minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a
discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive
restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency
can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. In particular, the EU Restructuring
Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which: (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by
creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation; (b) all creditor
claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at
a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes); (c)
creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not
more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a
majority in number of affected parties in each class; and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced
whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors,
even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required
majority. In order to be adopted, the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative
authority that will, in particular, ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance
with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan.

The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new
financing and interim financing, and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing
granted in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive was implemented into French law by:


-----

- the issuance of ordinance n° 0221-1193 by the French government on September 15, 2021
(the “2021 Ordinance”), effective from October 1, 2021 in respect only (with limited
exceptions) of preventive and insolvency proceedings opened as of such date; and

- the issuance of decree n° 2021-1218 by the French government on September 23, 2021 (the
“2021 Decree”) relating to the implementation of the 2021 Ordinance.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

French law and proceedings affecting creditors include debt rescheduling pursuant to Articles 1343-5
_et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil), court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc_ and
_procedure_ _de conciliation) and court-administered proceedings being either safeguard proceedings_
(procédure de _sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée)_
and judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (procédure de redressement or procedure de
_liquidation_ _judiciaire). In addition, any company of the Group having its center of main interests,_
within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation or, if not applicable, its COMI within the
meaning of article R.600-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) or an establishment
in France, could also be subject to French court administered proceedings. Any company of our
Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State could be subject
to French territorial insolvency proceedings.

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the registered office of the
Issuer or any of the Guarantors is deemed to be in France, they could be subject to French proceedings
affecting creditors including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings)
and court administered proceedings being either safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde) or
accelerated safeguard proceedings (procedure de sauvegarde accélérée), judicial reorganization
proceedings (procedure de redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (procedure de
_liquidation judiciaire). In addition, to the extent that their COMI or, in cases where the EU Insolvency_
Regulation does not apply, their main center of interests within the meaning of article R. 600-1 of the
French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), is deemed to be in France or they have an
establishment in France, they could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings
affecting creditors, i.e. either safeguard proceedings or accelerated safeguard proceedings
(sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or
judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or court-administered proceedings with respect to debtors
that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) 20
million euros in turnover and 250 employees or (y) 40 million euros in turnover, (ii) commencement
of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application
of the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply,
from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a
corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts
having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined
above and to specific control thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency
proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator and
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the
group.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under
the Notes and/or the Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security
interests in the Collateral.


-----

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial
reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of
the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of the Group having its COMI in France would be
subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation
and any company of the Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU
Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings
within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation also
lists accelerated financial safeguard proceedings as insolvency proceedings but accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings no longer exist under French law as they have been merged into accelerated
safeguard proceedings as of October 1, 2021 (save for proceedings commenced before this date) by
the 2021 Ordinance.

The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for
informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be
relevant to holders of the Notes.

**Warning Procedure (procédure d’alerte)**

In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for a warning
procedure. When there are elements which the statutory auditors of a company, registered as a société
_anonyme believe put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy, they must request that_
the management provide an explanation. Failing satisfactory explanation or appropriate corrective
measures, the auditors must request that a board of directors (or the equivalent body), and, as the case
may be, at a later stage the shareholders’ meeting be convened. Depending on the responses provided
to them (and the type of company), the auditors must inform the President of the relevant commercial
or civil court of the warning procedure.

Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee (or, in their
absence, the employees’ representative(s)) have similar rights.

Similar warning procedures exist for companies incorporated in France not registered as a _société_
_anonyme, with minor differences in technical details of the procedure._

The President of the relevant commercial or civil court also has the discretion to summon the
management to provide explanations on elements which the President of the relevant commercial or
civil court believes put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy (or when the company
has not filed its annual financial statements within the statutory timeframe, despite the injunction).

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, holders of Notes could, like any other creditors, be
subject to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings
involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s
financial position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of
two years the payment dates of payment obligations that are due and decide that any amounts, the
payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the
contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published semi-annually by the French
government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order
made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil) will suspend any pending
enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue
or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge. The application of such grace
periods cannot be calculated contractually.


-----

If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in
the course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “—Court-assisted
_Proceedings” below)._

**_Out-of-court and in-court proceedings_**

French law distinguishes between:

(i) court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc and conciliation), which are voluntary proceedings
in which the debtor seeks the assistance of a third party to negotiate an agreement with all or
part of its creditors and stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties with a view to, in
particular, restructuring its indebtedness. These proceedings are confidential. The third party is
appointed by the President of the competent commercial court upon proposal of the debtor
company, but the discussions themselves are conducted outside the court; and

(ii) court-administered proceedings (procédures collectives), which are proceedings, during which
payments by the debtor of pre-commencement claims and certain post-commencement claims
and legal actions by the creditors are suspended (automatic stay). These proceedings are public
and involve all creditors. Within this second category of proceedings, French law further
distinguishes between:

(A) safeguard proceedings and accelerated safeguard proceedings, which are voluntary
proceedings and available to debtors that are facing difficulties they cannot overcome,
but that are not insolvent (as defined below); and

(B) judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, which are mandatory
proceedings and must be opened by debtors that are insolvent.

**_Insolvency Test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it
is unable to pay its due debts (passif exigible) with its immediately available assets (actif disponible)
taking into account available credit facilities, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the
court order commencing the relevant proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be
carried back up to 18 months prior to the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date of
insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an
agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks
the beginning of the hardening period (see “—The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in Judicial
_Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings”)._

**_Court-Assisted Proceedings_**

A French debtor facing difficulties without being insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) (or
for 45 calendar days or less in the case of conciliation proceedings) may in certain conditions request
the commencement of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is
to help the company reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders e.g., an
agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness.

_Mandat ad hoc_ and _conciliation_ are informal proceedings that may only be initiated by the debtor
itself, in its sole discretion and are carried out under the supervision of the President of the relevant
court, which do not trigger any stay of enforcement against the debtor. In practice, _mandat ad hoc_
proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties (economic or financial) but are
not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law
(save for the disclosure of the court decision appointing the _mandataire ad hoc_ to the statutory
auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad


-----

_hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the_
court and do not automatically involve any stay of the claims or pending proceedings. The
proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the _mandataire ad hoc_ are determined by the
competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints such person, usually to facilitate
negotiations with creditors. The _mandataire ad hoc_ cannot coerce the creditors into accepting any
proposal, any agreement between the debtor and its main creditors (if any) will be negotiated on a
purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the
agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat _ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending_
proceedings, and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their
claims, but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings typically accept not to do so for
their duration. Conversely, Article L. 611-16 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce)
provides, inter alia, that any contractual provision that affects the performance of an agreement by
reducing the rights or increasing the obligations of a debtor solely as a result of the appointment of a
_mandataire ad hoc will be deemed to be void._

In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article
1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil) (see “—Grace Periods” above). The agreement reached
is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. The ordinance of the court
appointing the mandataire ad hoc shall be notified for informational purposes to the debtor’s auditors.

_Conciliation_ proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable
difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test”
above), or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by
law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory
auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur),
whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the President of the court.
The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months,
upon request of the conciliator, the president of the court may extend the conciliation period up to the
absolute maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement
approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this fivemonth period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation
period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself.

The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its
creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the
restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be
negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot
be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings are confidential (save for
their disclosure to statutory auditors if any and subject to the below), and do not automatically stay
any pending proceedings, and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to
recover their claims, but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to
do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire
_or liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings._
Conversely, Article L. 611-16 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) provides, inter
_alia, that any contractual provision that affects the performance of an agreement by reducing the_
rights or increasing the obligations of a debtor solely as a result of the appointment of a conciliator
will be deemed to be void.

Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), during the
proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period,
in accordance with Article 1343- 5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil) (see “—Grace periods”
above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment or
does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request to stay payment of its claim
(suspendre l’exigibilité de sa créance). In the latter case, the judge may, for the duration of the
conciliation proceedings, order the postponement or the rescheduling of the creditor’s claims that


-----

have not yet fallen due. A joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a
guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from grace periods
so granted by the judge.

Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce),
the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a
conciliation agreement (whether it is acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace
periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax
and social security organisations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for
payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken
after hearing the conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the
agreement.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the
President of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding
upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the
creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation
agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation
proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the relevant commercial
court at the request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose which will have to be
attended by the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be, if (i) the debtor is not
insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting
an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company
will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the
creditors that are not party to the conciliation agreement. Such approval will have the same effect as
its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and in addition:

(i) the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or commercial court, which should only disclose
the amount of any New Money Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests
granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain
confidential except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of
the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation
agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court;

(ii) persons that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or
services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than
shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of
payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to
certain pre-commencement or post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs)
(the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial
reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

(iii) in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their
holders’ consent, be written off or rescheduled by a safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted
(although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted),
not even by a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that classes of affected
parties are formed);

(iv) when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated
to its statutory auditors; and

(v) in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency Test”), and therefore the starting date of
the hardening period (as defined below, see “—The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in


-----

_Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings”), cannot be set by the court as of a date_
earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in
case of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the
debtor, appoint the _conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à_
_l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:_

(i) interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded;

(ii) the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings
for a grace period in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de commerce) as explained above; and

(iii) a joint-debtor and a third party which had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or
security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of
the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted in the context of conciliation
proceedings pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de
_commerce)._

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the
President of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or
approved) for its termination. Termination will however not extend to the provisions of the
conciliation agreement addressing the consequences of such termination. If such termination is
granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely,
provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with
respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended
and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will
automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their
claims (decreased by any potential recoveries) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted
on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or
total sale of the debtor’s business, particularly through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (plan
_de cession) which could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial_
reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any
offers received in this context by the _mandataire ad hoc or the_ _conciliateur may be directly_
considered by the court in the context of safeguard, reorganization or liquidation proceedings after
consultation with the public prosecutor.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of
an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of
the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a
request submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a
_mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of_
the fees of the professional advisors retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is
deemed null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement
being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself
entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic
commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced
before three months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**


-----

A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not
insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to
attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested.
Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur _judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that_
such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation
period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and
ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may
last up to 12 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in
preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will distribute to its creditors
(or submit to the classes of affected parties) that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors
or equity holders do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the
debtor assisted by the courtappointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in
accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over
decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the
management decisions (mission _d’assistance). A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a_
creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the_
proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator. Management decisions in respect of
disposals (acte de disposition) that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as
decisions considered to be important under statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge
(e.g., granting security interests or settling disputes).

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de
_cessation des paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator,_
the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor,
the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings
(a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) if the approval of a
safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the debtor would become insolvent shortly after the
safeguard proceedings should such proceedings come to an end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings
at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly
impossible. In all such cases, the court may decide any such conversion at the request of the debtor,
the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor or on its own
initiative with the exception of (i) (b) above where:

(i) the court may not act upon its own initiative; and

(ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the
workers’ representatives (if any).

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor
becomes immediately due and payable.

Persons that, in the context of accelerated safeguard, safeguard or judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings, provide new money (except through a share capital increase) (the “Judicial
Restructuring Lien”):

(i) during the observation period in safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings or the
temporary continuation of business in judicial liquidation proceedings, in order to ensure the
continuity of the debtor’s business during this period, in which case financing must be
authorized by the supervisory judge and be subject to publicity, or


-----

(ii) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (including a plan ordered by the
court that substantially modifies a previous one), in which case the amount and the privilege
must be specifically mentioned in the draft plan on which the affected parties are called upon to
vote as well as in the court decision adopting the plan, benefit from a priority of payment over
pre-commencement and post-commencement claims with the exception of (i) employees’
super-privileged claims, (ii) procedural costs, (iii) the New Money Lien in the event of ongoing or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial
liquidation proceedings, (iv) pre-commencement claims secured by security interests over real
estate assets (only in the context of judicial liquidation proceedings) and (v) postcommencement wages claims not advanced through the French wages guarantee scheme under
provisions of Articles L. 3253-8 to L. 3253-13 of the French Labor Code (Code du travail).

The Judicial Restructuring Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided prior to
commencement of the proceedings.

In addition, such claims may not be rescheduled or written-off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan
(although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) without
the consent of the relevant creditors, not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in
the event that classes of affected parties are formed), in the on-going or in subsequent safeguard
proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings.
During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debt incurred (i) prior to the
commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred
for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services
rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example,
the supervisory judge can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property
needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as
collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). In addition, creditors are required to declare to
the court appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), any debt that arose prior to the
commencement of the proceedings (as well as the post-proceedings commencement non-privileged
debts) and are prohibited from engaging individual lawsuits against the debtor for any payment
default in relation to such debts and the accrual of interest on loans with a term of less than one year,
or on payments deferred for less than one year, is stopped. Any debt arising after the commencement
of the safeguard proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the business’ ordinary
activities during the observation period or are for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in
consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they
fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the
commencement of the safeguard proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New
Money Lien).

Creditors (and if applicable, equityholders) must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s
liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for
equityswaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary
depending on the size of the business.

_Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors that, on the date of the petition for_
commencement of the proceedings (on a stand-alone basis or together with other entities that they hold
or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de commerce)) have less than (x) 250 employees and €20 million in net turnover, or (y) €40
million in net turnover unless, upon their request, the supervisory judge authorizes a class-based
consultation of their creditors (see below).

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed
creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the
debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.


-----

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and
whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According
to legal commentary and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible,
_provided that it is justified by the specific position of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed_
creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for
a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the
length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen
years).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as
the plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors consulted in writing that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement
proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’
representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the courtappointed administrator and the controllers.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de
_sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals_
that were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting
from the New Money Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien) over a maximum period of ten years
(except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity
dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain
the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant
creditor’s individual acceptance.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be
essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s
consent.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment
adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of
at least 5% of the total amount of the debt claim as admitted and, as from the sixth year, the amount of
each annual instalment must be of at least 10% (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first
payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date
provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor
would have received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying
to the other creditors.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide
that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of
securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting
is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the
meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the
meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply.
If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such
share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims
may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan).

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be
essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s
consent. The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the
modification is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the
interested parties are consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court


-----

clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following
the receipt. Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate
to debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps.

_Class-based consultation: This applies to companies that, on the date of the petition for commencement_
of the proceedings, meet or exceed either of the following thresholds (i) 250 employees and €20 million
in net turnover or (ii) €40 million in net turnover (on a standalone basis or together with other entities
that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French
Commercial Code (Code de commerce)), or upon the debtor’s request and with the authorization of
the supervisory judge if they do not meet such thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the
assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties (parties
_affectées), as defined below._

Only the affected parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan.

Pursuant to Article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), affected parties
are:

(i) creditors whose rights are directly impaired by the proposed plan;

(ii) equityholders (including shareholders and holders of securities giving future rights to the share
capital) if their equity interests, the debtor’s articles of association or by-laws, or their rights are
modified by the proposed plan.

The court-appointed administrator is responsible for drawing up the classes and informing each affected
party that it is a member of a class. The court-appointed administrator must, on the basis of objective
verifiable criteria, allocate the affected parties in classes presenting a sufficient commonality of
economic interest (communauté d’intérêt économique suffisante) in compliance with the following
conditions:

(i) creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles), in respect of
the claims so secured, and other creditors shall belong to different classes;

(ii) the class formation shall comply with subordination agreements entered into before
commencement of the proceedings that shall have been brought to the attention of the courtappointed administrator within ten days from his notification to each affected party of its
membership in a class;

(iii) equity holders shall make up one or more classes; and

(iv) claims arising from employment contracts (including the French wage guarantee scheme
claims), pension rights, and maintenance claims cannot be affected by the plan and in respect of
creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor, only the amount of their
claims that are not secured by such security trust is taken into account.

The court-appointed administrator shall notify to each affected party the criteria for class formation and
for the determination of the voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights allowing them
to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into consideration is the one communicated by the debtor
and certified by its auditor(s) or, failing that, endorsed by a certificate from its chartered certified
accountant. Future interest claims calculated by a reference to an index are calculated by reference to
the value of the index at the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings. The claims of
creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) shall only be taken into account for the portion of their
claim not secured by the security trust.


-----

Any affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors representative or the court-appointed
administrator is entitled, within ten days following the notification of the criteria for the formation of
the classes and the determination of the voting rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, to dispute
the same before the supervisory judge. The supervisory judge must rule within ten days of the referral
date, and failing that, any aforementioned person may refer the dispute to the court, which must rule
within ten days of such later referral date. The supervisory judge’s decision (or the court’s decision, as
the case may be) may be appealed within five days of its notification to the parties.

The proposed plan may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debt-for-equity
swaps (subject to specific exceptions, including in respect of claims benefiting from the New Money
Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien).

The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to the parties
concerned (creditors, bondholders, equityholders) and are ultimately determined by the court-appointed
judicial administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree.

The classes must approve or reject the plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be
extended or shortened by the supervisory judge, upon prior request of the debtor or the court-appointed
administrator, but may not be shorter than 15 days.

The decision shall be taken by each class by a two-thirds majority of the votes held by the members
casting a vote.

If applicable, the class or classes of equity holders vote under the rules governing votes at
shareholders/equityholders’ general meetings, except that the decision is taken at the same two-thirds
majority.

Once the draft plan has been adopted by each of the classes, it will be submitted to the commercial court
which shall essentially verify that the following conditions are met:

(i) the classes have been duly formed in accordance with the aforementioned rules;

(ii) affected parties, sharing a sufficient commonality of interest within the same class, are treated
equally and in proportion to their claim or right;

(iii) the plan has been duly notified to all the affected parties;

(iv) if there are dissenting affected parties, the plan meets the “best interests of creditors” test (i.e.,
no dissenting party is worse off as a result of the plan than it would be if the order of priority of
payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a
court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)) or in the event of a better alternative solution if the
plan was not approved);

(v) where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not
excessively impair the interests of the affected parties; and

(vi) the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected.

The court may refuse to adopt the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the
debtor’s insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The judgment adopting the plan
renders the plan enforceable against all (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted
against the adoption of the plan).

As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase,
the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against


-----

their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of
the plan).

_Cross-class cram-down: The 2021 Ordinance introduced a cross-class cram-down mechanism into_
French law. Where a safeguard plan is not approved by a two-thirds majority of each class, it may be
adopted by the court at the request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator (with the approval
of the debtor) and be imposed on the parties that voted against the plan provided that:

(i) the plan complies with the conditions for adoption of the plan by the court mentioned above;

(ii) the plan has been approved by:

(A) a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, provided that at least one
such class is a class of creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem
(sûretés réelles) or is senior to the unsecured creditors’ class (créanciers
_chirographaires); or, if such condition is not met,_

(B) at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than:

(1) an equity holders’ class; or

(2) any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going
concern, could not be reasonably expected to be entitled to any payment if the
order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in
the event of a piecemeal sale or a court- ordered sale plan (plan de cession));

(iii) the claims held by a dissenting class of affected parties are fully paid (by identical or equivalent
means) if a lower ranking class is entitled to be paid or retains an interest within the plan (i.e.,
absolute priority rule);

(iv) no class of affected parties receives or retains, under the plan, more than the total amount of its
claims or interests;

(v) where one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not approved the
plan, the plan can be imposed on such dissenting equity holders if:

(A) the debtor (on a standalone basis or together with other entities which they hold or
control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial
Code (Code de commerce)) meets or exceeds either of the following thresholds: (x) 250
employees and €20 million of net turnover or (y) €40 million in net turnover;

(B) it is reasonably foreseeable, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern,
that the equity holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to any
payment or retain any interest if the order of priority of payments in a judicial
liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered
sale plan (plan de cession));

(C) if the plan provides for a capital increase to be paid up by cash contribution or by way
of set off of claims, the shares issued are offered by preference to the shareholders, pro
_rata their shareholding; and_

(D) the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of the dissenting
class or classes of equity holders.


-----

The court’s decision constitutes approval of the changes to the shareholding structure, to the rights of
the equity holders, to the articles of association or the by-laws provided for in the plan. The court may
appoint a judicial representative to perform the acts necessary for the implementation of these changes.

Upon request from the debtor, or from the court-appointed administrator with the debtor’s consent,
the court can override the absolute priority rule if it is deemed necessary to achieve the plan’s
objectives and if the plan does not excessively affect the rights or interests of affected parties. In
particular, supplier claims, equity holders and tort liability claims may benefit from such exemption.

As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a
time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of
the debtor may not be disposed of without court’s consent.

If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the classes of affected parties, the court may,
at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the public
prosecutor, convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that
the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would
certainly lead the debtor to becoming insolvent in the near future.

At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having
voted against the draft plan and considering that:

(i) the best interest test criterion has not been met; or

(ii) in the event of a plan adopted by a cross-class cram-down and, based on the valuation of the
debtor as a going concern, either (or both) of the following conditions has not been met:

(A) in the event that the plan was approved solely by the vote of an affected class that was
not an equity holder, such class would not have been entitled to a payment if the order
of payment in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal
sale or a court-ordered sale plan); and/or

(B) in the event that a class, or classes, of equity holders voted against the plan, such
class(es) would not have received a payment or retained an interest in the event that the
order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event
of a piecemeal sale or of a court-ordered sale plan), may petition the court to dispute
the same.

Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the same
decision, determine the value of the debtor (in respect of which the court is entitled to order the
appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the
adoption of the plan.

This decision may itself be challenged within ten days of its notification or communication to them, by
the affected party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor.

In the event no safeguard plan is adopted through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by
approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down), there is no statute that allows
French courts to impose a term-out (i.e., a rescheduling over a maximum period of 10 years of the
indebtedness of dissenting creditors) although the courts retain this power under statute if the plan is
adopted under the standard consultation procedure (i.e., if no classes are formed and, in judicial
reorganization proceedings, in case of failure of the class-based consultation (see “—Court_administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings” below))._

_Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social_


-----

security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under
conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private
economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into
subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public
creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee
(Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct
taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties
or fines.

Where the plan provides for debt write-offs or rescheduling affecting secured public creditors’ claims,
the administrator can decide to gather those public creditors within a class (or classes) of affected parties
called upon to vote on the proposed plan.
**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard_**

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) enabling it to implement a restructuring
plan in an expedited fashion through a class-based consultation.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

(i) the debtor’s financial statements must have been certified by an auditor (commissaire aux
_comptes) or drawn-up by a chartered certified accountant (expert-comptable);_

(ii) the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the
commencement of the proceedings;

(iii) the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as
a going concern that is likely to be supported by enough of the parties that will be impaired to
render its adoption plausible within an initial two-month period, that may be extended up to a
total of four months, following commencement of the accelerated safeguard proceedings upon
request from the debtor and the court- appointed administrator; and

(iv) the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied for
commencement of conciliation proceedings.

The debtor may request the limitation of the scope of the accelerated safeguard proceedings to its
financial creditors only, if the nature of its indebtedness is such that a plan could be adopted by such
creditors alone.

If the debtor does not meet the thresholds above that require creditor classes (see above) to be formed,
the court must order such formation in the decision commencing the proceedings.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard
proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and the provisions relating to
the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings.

The plan, in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings, is adopted following the same majority
rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation
and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the
court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors
outside of the class process and, in particular, cannot impose a term-out. The list of claims of affected
parties party to the conciliation proceedings, established by the debtor and certified by the statutory
auditor or the chartered accountant, shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the


-----

purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings unless the affected parties otherwise elect to make such
a filing (see “—Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization
_or Liquidation Proceedings”)._

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings
may be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation
proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition
for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does
not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above); de jure managers (including directors) and,
as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline
are exposed to civil liability.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court,
after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate,
it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same
would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court
considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time
during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the public prosecutor or upon its own
initiative, the court may convert the judicial reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation
proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is
only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’
representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the
preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid
amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

Under the judicial reorganization proceedings, the administrator appointed by the court will assist the
debtor to make management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take
over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). As a result of the
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of the
management. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur
_judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an_
observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization
of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to
a draft safeguard plan and may include a partial sale of the business), or the partial or total sale of the
business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in
making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over
the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization
proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above),
subject to certain specificities.

There are differences by reference to safeguard proceedings that relate to class formation and the
adoption of the restructuring plan. The main differences are as follows:

(i) if the debtor does not meet the required threshold(s) the authorization to form classes of affected
parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the court- appointed administrator
on their own, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor);


-----

(ii) any affected party may submit a draft plan to the vote of the classes. The draft plan shall be
submitted, together with the plan proposed by the debtor, at the latest 15 days before the date of
the vote;

(iii) if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share
transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void;

(iv) if the plan has not been approved by all classes of affected parties, the court can decide to apply
the cross class cram-down mechanism at the request of any affected party (in addition to the
debtor or the administrator with the debtor’s consent); and

(v) in the event that plan approval through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by
regular approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down) fails the
approval of the plan may occur through the standard consultation rules (see above).

In relation to equityholders, the following is also to be noted in the event of judicial reorganization
proceedings:

(i) in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote in order to ensure that the shareholders’ equity is
at least equal to one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French
Commercial Code (Code de commerce), the court-appointed administrator may request the
appointment a court officer (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to
vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the courtappointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a
resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit
of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan;

(ii) if (a) the debtor company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the
French Commercial Code (Code de commerce)) one or more companies having together at least
150 employees, (b) the disappearance of the debtor company is likely to cause serious harm to
the national or regional economy and to local employment, (c) the modification of the debtor
company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or
regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then,
at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the
review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months
have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the
shareholders’ meetings required to approve the modification of the debtor company’s share
capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the
insolvency court may either:

(A) appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and
vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to
the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or

(B) order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan,
the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the
share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share
capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an
agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the debtor company’s
shareholders meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other
shareholders have the right to withdraw from the debtor company and request that their
shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the
parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.


-----

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new
shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the
duration of the reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly unlikely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if
no reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total
or partial sale of the business as part of a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession).

At any time during the observation period, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court
appointed administrator, the creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or
at its own initiative, order a partial cessation of activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the
liquidation of the debtor if its reorganization is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation
period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator,
which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation
period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to
simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the
debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the
extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority
order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the
managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes, both of which
are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors:

(i) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary
period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable
once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, also known as
a sale plan (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being
entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business. As part of the bids submitted to
the court, the third- party purchaser may cherry-pick assets (including the real estate
assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price
offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is usually at a significant
discount compared to their going-concern market value. The court will tend to favor a credible
sale plan that ensures the continuation of the business as a going-concern and the preservation
of jobs, over the payment of creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially
impose such a sale plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general
principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way
of exception:

(A) a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors
having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such
creditors and included in the sale of the business plan;

(B) the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if
the outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of
the leased asset as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by
the court); and

(C) only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for
pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over
real estate assets) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on


-----

which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until they are
repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless an agreement is reached with the
relevant parties.

Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business
of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are
located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Once more, the price offered
for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their going-concern market value; or

(ii) separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

(A) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères or adjudication amiable for real estate assets
only);

(B) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which unsolicited purchase
offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the supervisory judge being
necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or

(C) request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested
purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive
process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed
prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés).

If the court orders a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential
to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the judicial liquidation proceedings when either:

(i) no due liabilities remain or the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction
_du passif); or_

(ii) continuation of the liquidation operations becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets
(insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

(i) when the benefit of the continuation of the liquidation procedure is disproportionate when
compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or

(ii) in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors in full, by appointing a
mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from
these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

**_The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation_**
**_Proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18
months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may
not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important
because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the
insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings affecting it.


-----

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by
the court, such as:

(i) automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the
hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to
the detriment of other creditors. Such transactions or payments must be set aside by the court if a
claimant (such as an insolvency officer or the public prosecutor) so requests. These include
transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the
obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party,
payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a
manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or
monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond
or as a precautionary measure in accordance with article 2350 of the French Civil Code (Code
_civil), security granted for indebtedness (including a security to secure a guarantee obligation)_
previously incurred (unless they replace a previous security interest of at least an equivalent
nature and base and with the exception of the assignment of professional receivables (Dailly
_assignment) made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the date of_
insolvency), provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the
attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the
transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as
security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that
affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such
amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration
_d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de_
_commerce); and_

(ii) transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due,
transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers
_détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in_
each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was
insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration
and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité)
pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) are also
voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening
period.

Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court
has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only
“voidable.” There is no hardening period prior to safeguard proceedings or to accelerated safeguard
proceedings.

**_Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial_**
**_Liquidation Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the safeguard or insolvency
proceedings triggers (or gives creditors the right to trigger) the acceleration of the debt (except with
respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of
the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the
debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing
_contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of_
_judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated_
January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated
safeguard proceedings). However, except in accelerated safeguard proceedings and judicial
liquidation proceedings where the continued operation of the business has not been ordered by the
court, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts
(contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the


-----

court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their
obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully
performs its post-petition contractual obligations (and _provided_ that, in the case of judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the
debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however,
automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the
continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a sale plan (plan de cession) as
described above; in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court
decision adopting the sale plan (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months,
renewable once), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business
ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

(i) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of
contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest
can no longer be compounded);

(ii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set off of related
(connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to
recover assets (whether they be pledged, retained by a creditor based on a retention right or
constitute collateral in a security trust estate (patrimoine fiduciaire), for which recovery is
justified by the continued operation of the business) or to pay a carrier requesting payment
directly from the debtor;

(iii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the
proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation
period or in consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor and a security
interest can be granted in respect of any such debt the payment of which is not prohibited,
subject to prior authorization by the insolvency judge (juge-commissaire);

(iv) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services
rendered or goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall
due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien or a
Judicial Restructuring Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial
administrator or, failing that, the mandataire judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be
in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the expiration of
the observation period;

(v) creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a
guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person) with respect to any claim
arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal
action is:

(A) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor
(however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to
file a proof of claim, as described below);

(B) to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or

(C) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such assets
secure third party debt except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the
applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged
assets or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable is


-----

located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in
rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings
commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation (subject to secondary proceedings that may be commenced in such Member
State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France
and the European Union would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings
if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located
(unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party);

(vi) any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention right (by any
means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration of
securities or proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is
prohibited; any contrary provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights
of the debtor not yet in existence on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings, will
be held unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the
increase in the base of a contractual security interest may however validly result from an
assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a master agreement
entered into before commencement of the proceedings or from other specific contrary provisions
of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) regarding restructuring and insolvency, the
French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) or the French Insurance
Code (Code des assurances); and

(vii) in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of
payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract
(contrat en cours) will be required.

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan
(“plan de sauvegarde”) or of a judicial reorganization plan (“plan de redressement”) adopted by the
court.

In accelerated safeguard, the above rules would only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of
the proceedings. Debts owed to creditors that are not within the scope of the proceedings continue to
be payable in the ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose debts arose prior to the
commencement of proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative
within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des
_annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled_
outside France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts,
with respect to which the two- or four-month period referred to above starts to run as from their
maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except
for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings.
Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law.

In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third
party must also file a statement of claim with the creditors’ representative under the same conditions.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the judicial administrator and the
creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all their claims. Where the debtor has
informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor
is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor.
Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency
judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proofs of claim within the
deadlines described above.

In accelerated safeguard, however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken
part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant.


-----

Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail
themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as
set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors
who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the
aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of
creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its
creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of
the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in
accordance with their ranking.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including
employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials, fees), creditors who benefit
from a New Money Lien (see above) or Judicial Restructuring Lien (see above), post-commencement
privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation
proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate
are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all
creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with
respect to their claim related to such asset.

As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, the immediate payment of any unpaid amount of
share capital of the debtor will be required.

The _mandataire judiciaire_ may demand that a shareholder pay-up its portion of the unpaid share
capital.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where
safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors
may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the
granting of such facilities was wrongful, in the case of (i) fraud, (ii) interference with the management
of the debtor or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to
such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a
creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

- certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations that would constitute prohibited
financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code
or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French
Commercial Code; and

- French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of
another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

Pursuant to French corporate benefit rules, French Guarantors must receive an actual and adequate
benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court
could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant
guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these


-----

criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether
the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which
French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors and the amounts recoverable
thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the
Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness
previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under
intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be
made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor
under its Guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce _pro tanto the_
outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under
the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French
Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantees.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that
is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on
an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable
arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

**_Rights in the Collateral May be Adversely Affected by the Failure to Perfect Security Interests in_**
**_the Collateral_**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security.
The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the
Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of
these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have
any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the
securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions) that are governed
by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres
_financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be_
validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte de
_titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge_
will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares
registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are
available for security interests that are not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities
account), with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not
publicly registered.

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Security Interests and Cash Amount (soulte)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is
due and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a securities account
or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at
the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public
auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged
securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of
the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a
judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished
up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context
of a judicial attribution or by a precontractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual
foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor
may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value
of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the


-----

actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of
the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to
the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the
remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance
with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible
that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the
latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an
investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the
methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

**_Security Agent_**

Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security interests and
personal guarantees for the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately
from its own estate. As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal
guarantees will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in
cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The
security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its
duties. The security agent can take all legal actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests and file a
receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security
agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying its quality, its duties, the duration
of its duties and its powers.

**_Parallel Debt—Trust_**

The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security
Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim,
they will be provided for by the creation of “Parallel Debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent
mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the holders of the
Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”).

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal
Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding
Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding
Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim
equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law
will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and
the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take
enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if
they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10 25533 _Belvédère) relating to a bond_
documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France
of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent
benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of
the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international
public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French
debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt
mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a
recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no
assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be
noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not


-----

asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that
case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be
considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent
benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will
eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as
Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other
parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an
enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear
the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the
beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly
important following defaults or events of default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best
interests of the holders of the Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation), which has held, in Belvédère, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust
governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard
proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the
above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts
and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French
law.

The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of the Security Agent. To the extent that the
security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent are successfully
challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any
proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the
Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

French law contains specific action paulienne provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in
and outside insolvency proceedings. The _action paulienne offers creditors protection against a_
decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation,
an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third
party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations,
enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having
similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of such debtor by the creditors’
representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan
(commissaire à l’exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor or by any of the
creditors of such debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its
means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal
act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without
an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings)
any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time
the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should
have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in
their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no
such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the
grant of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent
conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes,
the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Guarantee could be
declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged
the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes
may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and


-----

the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the
security interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders
of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances,
holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the
Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of Intercreditor Arrangements by French Courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the
Intercreditor Agreement, except for Article L. 626-30 and L. 628-7 of the French Commercial Code
pursuant to which, in the context of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the courtappointed administrator, while constituting the classes shall comply with the provisions of
subordination agreements between creditors that were entered into prior to the commencement of the
safeguard, accelerated safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, provided that such
subordination agreements have been brought to his attention within the required deadline. As a
consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as of the date of this offering
memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would
not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Recognition of Validity of Lower Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges by French Courts_**

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge
over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares
of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which
are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres
_financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account_
in which the shares of such a company are registered.

Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities
account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or
lower ranking pledge thereon. To our knowledge, French courts have never expressly recognized the
concept of second (or lower) ranking pledge in respect of a financial securities account and, although
article 2340 of the French Civil Code does recognize the possibility to create multiple pledges in
respect of the same tangible asset, this article is not expressly stated to apply to pledges over financial
securities account, and consequently, no assurances can be given that such second or lower ranking
pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower ranking pledge
over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively registered may be
held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the
recovery under the Notes or Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event.

**_Assumptions as to the Enforceability of Lower Ranking Pledges Over Receivables or Bank_**
**_Accounts_**

Certain pledges over receivables or bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien
searches are available for security interests that are not registered, such as pledges over bank accounts
or receivables. As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the relevant
bank accounts or receivables of a company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over a bank account or
receivables from granting a second, or lower-ranking pledge over the same bank account or
receivables, this structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurance can be given
that such second, or lower-ranking pledges would be upheld if tested.


-----

**England and Wales**

Some of the Guarantors and Collateral providers are incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales (the “English Guarantors”). Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the English
Guarantors would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws. It is
nonetheless possible that insolvency proceedings with respect to an English Guarantor could be
opened in a different jurisdiction and be governed by the insolvency laws of that jurisdiction.

In particular, since December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom is no longer a European Member State,
including for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation and Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the
European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters (the “EU Judgments Regulation”), which have largely
been repealed in the United Kingdom (pursuant to The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit)
Regulations 2019, The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 and The
Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (together, the “Insolvency Brexit
Regulations”) and The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019).
Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer party to the European regime for reciprocal
recognition of insolvency proceedings or civil/commercial judgments under the EU Insolvency
Regulation or the EU Judgments Regulation, respectively. The prospects of a European Member
State opening insolvency proceedings in respect of an English Guarantor may vary between Member
States; the implications of any such proceedings, including the prospect and implications of
recognition in the United Kingdom, would need to be carefully considered in each case. To the extent
that an English Guarantor has its COMI in a European Member State, insolvency proceedings could,
pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the
relevant European Member State and be subject to the laws of that European Member State (see “—
_European Union”)._

Similarly, the UK Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030), which implement the
UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign
(i.e., non- English) court may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings where any English
company has its center of main interests in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an
“establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out nontransitory economic activities with human means and assets or services).

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with
which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Guarantor experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar
proceedings. English insolvency laws may not be as favorable to investors as United States or other
insolvency laws.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number
of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court,
the company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) commencing
administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company
resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay
its debts.

Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “Insolvency Act”), a company is deemed unable to
pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it
is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of
its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such insolvency is
presumed if, among others, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a
debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy a judgment debt (or similar court order).

English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against a
Guarantor and of the security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of


-----

certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations. The application of these
laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights and/or the Collateral
securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency
of a Guarantor.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

The Notes and the Guarantees may benefit from fixed and floating charge security. There are a
number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security:

- an administrator appointed to the company which granted the floating charge may (i) dispose of
or take action relating to assets subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the
charge holder or court but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the
proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge, where the floating charge
is not a security financial collateral arrangement, use the proceeds and/or cash subject to a
floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to
operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the
floating charge holder. Only with prior approval of the court (or the relevant secured creditor)
can an administrator deal with property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the
property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator will apply
the gross proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the
obligations of the company to the charge holder;

- a fixed charge over assets, even if created after the date of a floating charge over the assets, may
rank prior to the floating charge over the same assets (provided that the floating charge has not
crystallized at the time the fixed charge is granted and there were no restrictions on the creation
of such security of which the fixed charge holder was aware);

- provided that the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, general costs
and expenses (including the remuneration of insolvency officeholders) properly incurred in a
winding-up or administration are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company
(including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) to the extent the assets of the
company available for creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to
certain restrictions for the costs of litigation) in priority to floating charge claims (the same does
not apply to fixed charge assets);

- until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are
subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of its business, meaning that such assets
can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third- party good title to
the assets free of the floating charge;

- floating charge security is subject to certain challenges and claw-back risks under English
insolvency law (see “—Voidable Floating Charges”); and (f) floating charge security is subject
to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as employee salary claims (up to a cap per
employee), employee holiday claims, certain unpaid pension contributions and certain tax
obligations)) and, where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, to
the claims of unsecured creditors in respect of a ring fenced amount of the proceeds (see “—
_Administration and Floating Charges”)._

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any
security interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee
does not have the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the
relevant assets and the proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice as the
description given to the charges in the relevant security document as fixed charges is not
determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the


-----

chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge,
notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests: (i) the proceeds of
those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of
the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings and (ii) it is possible that any purported
floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property
of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge.” See also
“— Administrative Receivership.”

**_Administration_**

Under the Insolvency Act, administration proceedings are available in respect of any company
incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or a member state of the EEA, in addition to a company
registered under the Companies Act 2006 in England and Wales or Scotland and a company not
incorporated in an EEA member state but with its COMI in the United Kingdom or an EU member
state (other than Denmark) and upon request from courts in other parts of the United Kingdom or
certain other countries and territories. Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an
administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to
become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the
purpose of administration.

The purpose of an administration comprises three objectives, each of which must be considered
successively to determine whether it is reasonable to put the company into administration: rescuing
the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for
the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first
being in administration) or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests
of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a
distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. An administrator must attempt to
achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless (s)he thinks it is not reasonably practicable
to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the
company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless (s)he
thinks either the first or the second objective is unachievable and that it will not unnecessarily harm
the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective.

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or
the holder of a qualifying floating charge (for further detail on what constitutes a qualifying floating
charge, see “Qualifying Floating Charge” below) where the floating charge has become enforceable,
may also appoint an administrator through an out of court process, subject to certain exceptions
pursuant to the Insolvency Act. Note that different procedures apply according to the identity of the
appointor.

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business as an agent of the company to which
they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the
property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set
proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to
be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the
Prescribed Part (see “Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the
court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to
promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the
disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder.

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration.
Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed such that no step may


-----

be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of
the administrator or leave of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a
guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the
institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and
diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider
discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory
objectives of administration described above.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be
able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory
moratorium.

This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral
agreement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or
tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”). If a
company were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent such security is a financial
collateral arrangement, the security granted by it would be enforceable while it is in administration
without leave of the court or consent of the administrators.

Accordingly, if any of the Guarantors were to enter into administration, the Notes, the Guarantees and
the Collateral may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of the
administrator while the relevant company was in administration. There can be no assurance that the
Security Agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

**_Qualifying Floating Charge_**

If a company grants security constituting a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of
English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator out of court (see “—
_Administration”) or (in limited circumstances) an administrative receiver (see “—_ _Administrative_
_Receivership”). The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an_
intention of a company or its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to
either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the
proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms
of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into
administration.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an
instrument which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (paragraph 14 of
Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act); (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an
administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative
receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder
of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other
forms of security granted to that party, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property
of the relevant company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please
note that it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ‘the whole or
substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what
percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

**_Administrative Receivership_**

If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English insolvency
law, that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver if the qualifying floating charge falls
within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002) to
the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers, or if the security document pre-dates


-----

September 15, 2003.

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is
the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which
may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company
during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market
investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act and generally includes rated, listed or traded
debt instruments and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court
(and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of
court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or
the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is
capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge (see
“Transactions at an Undervalue”, “Preference” and “Voidable Floating Charge” below,
respectively). If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any
receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

**_Fixed Charge Receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain
floating charges, see “Administrative Receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the
assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed
charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the
charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the
demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel
to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed
charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial
collateral arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see
“Administration” above).

The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed,
meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an
administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In
other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In
realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price
obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory
indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and
may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be
deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and
any preferential creditors (see “Prescribed Part” below).

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

A scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006,
which permits a company to enter into an arrangement or compromise with its members or creditors
(or any class of them).

The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise
of a company’s liabilities with respect to its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where such
company is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act which, in the context of a non-English


-----

company, requires a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on
the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number
of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and
any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by
the company or its creditors (but a creditor-led scheme nonetheless requires the company’s consent).
If a simple majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and
voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective
of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will
(subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected
creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme
then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness
of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to
sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or
reject the scheme. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of
guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not
automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings, although the directors may apply for
moratorium (see “— Moratorium”) to provide protection pending the sanction of the scheme if the
relevant company is eligible.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA”) was enacted on June 25, 2020.
CIGA is intended to improve the ability of companies to be efficiently restructured; it includes the
following provisions.

_Moratorium_

Part A1 of the Insolvency Act, as introduced by CIGA, provides a standalone moratorium which can
benefit certain distressed companies by giving them various protections from creditors and providing
them with a breathing space to formulate a rescue and/or restructuring plan.

The moratorium is a “debtor-in-possession” process, meaning that a company in a moratorium
remains under the management of its directors, but the moratorium is supervised by an insolvency
practitioner, called a “monitor”.

As a condition to commencement of the moratorium, the company requires confirmation from the
monitor that the company is eligible for the moratorium and that, in the monitor’s view, it is likely
that a moratorium for the company would result in the rescue of the company as a going concern.

The moratorium is available to companies that are, or are likely to become, unable to pay their debts.
A company is excluded from being eligible for the moratorium if (among others):

- at any time in the previous 12 months, the company has been subject to a formal insolvency
proceeding; or

- the company is party to a “capital market arrangement” (including the grant of security or a
guarantee) under which a party has incurred a debt of at least £10 million, where the
arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. This includes, among others,
secured and unsecured debt, but the debt instrument either has to be rated, listed, traded (or
designed to be rated, listed or traded), or bonds or commercial paper issued to professional,
high net worth or sophisticated investors.


-----

The moratorium lasts for an initial period of twenty (20) business days, subject to possible extension.
A company subject to a moratorium effectively receives a payment holiday in respect of its premoratorium debts, subject to broad exceptions (including debts or liabilities arising under a contract
involving financial services). The company will still be expected to pay certain debts incurred while
the moratorium is in force (“moratorium debts”) including those which arise during the moratorium
under an obligation incurred before the moratorium commenced (known as “priority pre-moratorium
debts”), including the costs of goods and services, employees and rent, together with all amounts falling
due under loan agreements and other financial services contracts.

The monitor must terminate the moratorium if certain circumstances arise, including if the monitor
thinks that the moratorium is no longer likely to result in the rescue of a company as a going
concern. If a company enters liquidation within 12 weeks following the end of a moratorium, any
unpaid moratorium debts, and certain pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a
payment holiday during the moratorium, will have priority over other claims in the liquidation. Preexisting financial debts accelerated during the moratorium will not receive such priority, other than
in respect of amounts which already fell due during the moratorium. If a company enters
administration within 12 weeks following the end of a moratorium, the administrator must make a
distribution in respect of any unpaid moratorium debts, and those pre moratorium debts for which
the company did not have a payment holiday during the moratorium and which are payable in
priority over other claims in administration.

Any person affected by the moratorium may challenge it on certain grounds, including that of unfair
harm, at any time during the moratorium.

_Restructuring Plan Procedure_

CIGA also introduced the restructuring plan which is a new restructuring procedure under Part 26A
of the Companies Act 2006, similar to a scheme of arrangement but with the added possibility of
cross-class cram-down to bind classes of dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan. A
restructuring plan procedure may be proposed by the company or other stakeholders (including
creditors, shareholders, administrators or liquidators); the consent of the company (or its insolvency
officeholders) is required if the plan is proposed by a creditor or shareholder.

The restructuring plan procedure is available as an option to both solvent and insolvent companies;
the company must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that
are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern and (b) a
compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class
of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent or mitigate the effect of, any of those
financial difficulties.

The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a restructuring plan where the plan company is
liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act which, in the context of a non-English company,
requires a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. The process closely resembles that of
schemes of arrangement. At the first hearing, the court will examine the constitution of classes as
proposed by the plan proponent (depending on the rights proposed to be compromised via the plan
and any new rights to be granted pursuant to the plan). Creditors and members whose rights would
be affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in the relevant
stakeholder meetings, unless they have been excluded by reason of having no genuine economic
interest in the company. Subject to the requisite voting thresholds being met, at a second hearing, the
court will consider if the necessary requirements have been met (including the requirements for
binding a dissenting class, if applicable) and will consider whether to sanction the restructuring plan.

For a class of stakeholders to approve the plan, at least 75% in value, of those voting, must vote in
favor. The plan may still be confirmed by the court even where certain classes do not vote in favor,
provided that:


-----

- the court is satisfied that none of the members of the dissenting class(es) would be any
worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ (being
whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the
plan were not sanctioned); and

- at least one class who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the
company, in the event of the relevant alternative has voted in favor of the plan.

The court retains discretion as to whether to sanction the plan. Unlike an administration proceeding,
the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings,
although the directors may apply for moratorium (see “— _Moratorium”) to provide protection_
pending the sanction of the plan if the relevant company is eligible.

Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of a standalone moratorium
(see “— Moratorium”), any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium
debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the restructuring plan
without their consent. Stakeholders’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as
provided for in the plan. If a company were subsequently to enter an insolvency procedure following
a restructuring plan, the rights and claims of any stakeholders bound by the plan would be as set out
in the plan. Any debt forgiveness would therefore be binding in the subsequent insolvency
proceedings.

**_Liquidation/Winding-Up_**

Liquidation is an asset realization and distribution procedure under which the assets of the company
are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed
by the Insolvency Act, as amended.

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court and (b)
members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the
company’s members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the
company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a
statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months, whereas the
primary ground for a creditors’ voluntary liquidation is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in
Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). A creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from
administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place is
subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’
voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the
United Kingdom in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction, members’
voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or
Scotland.

The effect of a compulsory winding up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary
winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition
of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless
sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest
subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the
Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in
accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding up of
a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the
winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against
the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company
without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of
a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the members’ resolution to wind


-----

up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no
automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or
shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and
enforcement of security.

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property by
serving the prescribed notice on the relevant counterparty. Onerous property, for these purposes, is
any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company which is unsaleable or not readily
saleable or is such that it may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act.
A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing
financial obligations on the company which may be regarded as detrimental to creditors. A contract
will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company
could have made, or could make, a better bargain. This power does not apply to a contract all the
obligations under which have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and
liabilities.

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry
on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the
company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company; and to challenge antecedent
transactions.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator
as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement (“CVA”) to the company’s
shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company
and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company’s debts. Provided that the
proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will
bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A CVA cannot affect the
right of a secured or preferential creditor, except with its consent. A CVA is implemented under the
supervision of an insolvency practitioner who will act as the nominee before the CVA proposals are
approved, and as the supervisor afterwards. CVAs may also be used as a tool alongside a formal
insolvency procedure such as administration in order to implement a compromise between the debtor
company and its creditors.

A company is eligible to propose a CVA if it is (i) registered under the Companies Act 2006 (or the
preceding legislation) in England and Wales or Scotland (ii) if it is incorporated in a member state of
the European Economic Area or (iii) if the company is not incorporated in a member state of the
European Economic Area but has its “center of main interests” in a member state of the European
Union (other than Denmark) or in the United Kingdom.

In order for the CVA proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the
company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of
unconnected creditors may vote against it. Shareholders of the company are also asked to vote on the
CVA but, whether or not they vote in favor, the CVA will be implemented if the requisite majority
of creditors approve the proposal.

Secured debt cannot be voted in a CVA except to the extent that it is under-secured. A secured
creditor who proves in the CVA for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its
security. A CVA does not trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Priority of Claims_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going
concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of
the insolvent company and to distribute realizations made from those assets to its creditors.


-----

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed
into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the
realization of the insolvent company’s property are applied in descending order of priority, as set out
below.

With the exception of the “Prescribed Part” (see “—Prescribed Part”), distributions generally
cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have
been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a _pari passu_
basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or
administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as
applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what
is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net
balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if
amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if
amounts remain due to the company).

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

- _First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary_
interest in specific assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of
the debtor but only to the extent the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to
the asset in which they have a proprietary interest (less the costs of realization);

- _Second ranking claims: where winding-up procedures are begun within 12 weeks following_
the end of any (new, stand-alone) moratorium prescribed fees and expenses of the official
receiver (if applicable);

- _Third ranking claims: where winding-up procedures are begun or administration is entered_
into within 12 weeks following the end of any (new, stand-alone) moratorium (see further
above), unpaid moratorium debts and unpaid priority pre-moratorium debts;

- _Fourth ranking claims: expenses incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings,_
including the remuneration of the insolvency practitioner (there are statutory provisions
setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid);

- _Fifth ranking claims: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in
relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of
employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800
per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the
termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building society
deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up
to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after ordinary preferential debts and include claims
by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income
tax (including student loan repayments), employee National Insurance contributions and
Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer National
Insurance contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers as
well as bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent such
claims exceed the statutory limit. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally;


-----

- _Sixth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations_
from those secured assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any
security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but
which, on a proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However,
before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as
defined herein) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured
creditors (see “— Prescribed Part”);

 - _Seventh ranking claims:_

‒ firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent
of any remaining debt due to it (a shortfall), in each case including accrued and
unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant
insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any shortfall, the insolvency
officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are
not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is
sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors in full;

‒ secondly, interest on the company's debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual
rate and the official rate in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8%
per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after
the commencement of any administration which had been converted into a
distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts
due under the notes or the guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the notes
may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of
such security recoveries; and

‒ thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the
categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all
categories above are fully paid. This however does not include “currency
conversion” claims following the UK Supreme Court Lehman Brothers ruling dated
May 17, 2017; and

 - _Eighth ranking claims: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in_
full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent
company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

**_Prescribed Part_**

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will
generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating
charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential
creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law,
this applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations, and (b) 20% of the
remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s
net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first ranking floating charge created before
April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). Whether the assets that are
subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the
relevant English chargor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question
of fact at that time.

The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would
be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for
any shortfall claims of secured creditors.


-----

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of debt, any debt
of a company payable in a currency other than pounds sterling (such as euro or U.S. dollars) must be
converted into pounds sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the officeholder by
reference to the exchange rates prevailing at the date when the company went into liquidation or, if
the liquidation was immediately preceded by an administration, on the date that the company entered
administration. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers
the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court; if, on hearing the application, the court
finds that the rate is unreasonable, it may itself determine the rate.

Accordingly, in the event that an English Guarantor goes into liquidation or administration, holders
of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date that such English Guarantor went
into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may
become entitled. Any losses resulting from currency fluctuations are not recoverable from the
insolvent estate.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security / Avoidance of Transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by a company of
security and/or guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an administrator or
liquidator is appointed to the company within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee
and/or security. If security or a guarantee granted by a company is challenged under the laws of
England and Wales, and the court makes certain findings, it may be permitted to:

- avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a company’s obligations under the security and/ or
guarantee provided by such English company;

- direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid by or realized from a company
under a guarantee or security to the relevant company or to a fund for the benefit of the
company’s creditors; and/or

- take other action that is detrimental to the holders of the Notes.

The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of a company’s insolvency (as described
further below) is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a security
interest or guarantee in respect of the relevant Notes would not be challenged or that a court would
uphold the transaction as valid.

**_Onset of Insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences
and invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration, the
onset of insolvency is the date on which (a) the court application for an administration order is issued
or (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or (c) otherwise, the date on
which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of
insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary
liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation
follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be as for the initial administration.

**_Connected Persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into
by the company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions
will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out more particularly below).


-----

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of
transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges is a party who is (i) a director
of the company, (ii) a shadow director, (iii) an associate of such director or shadow director or (iv)
an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (iv)
the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual, or (v) the husband, wife or civil
partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company.

A company is associated with another company if (i) the same person has control of both companies,
(ii) a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his
associates have control of the other, or (iii) if a group of two or more persons has control of each
company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the
same person by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of
whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another
company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his or her
directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of
the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of
it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as
having control of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security
interest or guarantee granted by a Guarantor include the following.

**_Transaction at an Undervalue_**

Under Section 238 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to
the court for an order to set aside a transaction, for example the creation of a security interest or a
guarantee granted by the company (or give such other relief as the court thinks fit for restoring the
position to what it otherwise would have been) on the grounds that the creation of such security
interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue.

A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the company receives no consideration or
if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than
the consideration given by such company. For a challenge to be made, the transaction must have
occurred within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240
of the Insolvency Act, as amended). A court will not generally make an order in respect of a
transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good
faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were
reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the
court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue the court can make such
order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been
entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any
security interests or guarantees although there is protection for a third-party which benefits from the
transaction and has acted in good faith for value). In any challenge proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the
time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the
Insolvency Act) unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a “connected person” (as defined in the
Insolvency Act, as amended and as set out in detail above), in which case there is a presumption the
company was unable to pay its debts and the connected person must demonstrate the company was
not unable to pay its debts in such proceedings.


-----

An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose an
obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into
the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired
from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving
from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in
good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except
where the person was a party to the transaction.

**_Preference_**

Under Section 239 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to
the court for an order to set aside a transaction, for example the creation of a security interest or a
guarantee (or give such other relief as the court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it
otherwise would have been) on the grounds such security interest or such guarantee constituted a
preference.

The grant of a security interest or guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or
a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent
liquidation than if the security interest or guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be
made, the decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months ending with the onset of
insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the Insolvency Act, as amended) if the beneficiary of the
security interest or the guarantee is not a connected person, or two years if the beneficiary is a
connected person. A court will not make an order in respect of a preference of a person unless it is
satisfied the company was influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to produce the “better
position” for that person. Case law suggests there must be a desire to prefer one creditor over another
and not just other commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of producing the better
position. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can
make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference
had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the
security interests or guarantees).

There is protection for a third party which benefits from the transaction and acted in good faith for
value. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English
company was unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts
as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act) and that the company was influenced by
a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected
person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce
the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was
no such influence.

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_**

Under Section 423 of the Insolvency Act, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an
undervalue and was made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is
making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a
person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, and one or more of the
criteria set out in the applicable provisions of the Insolvency Act is satisfied, the transaction may be
set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors.

This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (and is not
therefore limited to liquidators or administrators) and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial
Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. There is no statutory time limit in the English
insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does not
need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction.


-----

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make
such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not
been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court
order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not (s)he is the
person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any
interest in property which was acquired from a third party in good faith, for value and without notice of
the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction
in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum unless such
person was a party to the transaction.

**_Extortionate Credit Transaction_**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The
court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years before
the day on which that company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is
“extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it
are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or
in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened
ordinary principles of fair dealing.

**_Account Banks’ Right to Set-off_**

With respect to English law governed charges over cash deposits (each an “Account Charge”)
granted by a chargor over any of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are
held (each an “Account Bank”) may have reserved their right at any time (whether prior to or upon a
crystallization event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which
they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangement with that chargor. As a result, and if
the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral
constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off
rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating
charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the
occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant chargor) the Account Bank will
no longer be entitled to exercise its netting and set-off rights in relation to the account, except where
the Account Banks have expressly reserved set-off rights.

**_Voidable Floating Charges_**

Under Section 245 of the Insolvency Act, if a company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as
a result of) granting a floating charge then such floating charge can be avoided on the action of a
liquidator or administrator if it was granted in the period of one year ending with the onset of
insolvency. The floating charge will, however, be validated to the extent of the value of the
consideration provided for the creation of the charge in the form of money paid to, or goods or services
supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same
time as or after the creation of the floating charge plus interest payable on such amounts. Where the
floating charge is granted to a “connected person” the charge can be challenged if given within two
years of the onset of insolvency and the prerequisite to challenge that the company is unable to pay
its debts does not apply. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral
agreement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to
challenge as described in this paragraph.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring
that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. A liquidator or administrator can inform the
relevant floating charge holder that it considers the charge to be invalid (or only partly valid as
regards new consideration). This may prompt the floating charge holder to seek to enforce the charge
(which would then likely trigger an application from the office holder for a court declaration that the
charge is invalid) or seek a court declaration as to its validity.


-----

_Recharacterization of Fixed Charges_

As referred to above (see “—Fixed Versus Floating Charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being
recharacterized as a floating charge. If such recharacterization falls within the suspect period referred
to above (see “—Voidable Floating Charges”), this could render the charge invalid except to the
value of the consideration.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

_Constitutional documents, corporate benefit and financial assistance_

The grant of a Guarantee or security interest by an English Guarantor in respect of the obligations of
another member of the Group must satisfy certain legal requirements.

More specifically, such transaction must be allowed by the respective obligor’s memorandum and
articles of association. To the extent these do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant
of the Guarantee and the subsequent Collateral can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s
rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an
English obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its
interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each obligor that is incorporated in
England and Wales by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the
Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that (s)he considers, in good faith,
would be most likely to promote success of the relevant obligor for the benefit of its members as a
whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit,
they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to
being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally acknowledges
that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of
the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors
arise, the Supreme Court has held that the shift takes place when a company is “insolvent or
bordering on insolvency,” or an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable.

Guarantees and security granted by a guarantor or security provider incorporated in England and
Wales are also subject to limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance
within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006.

_Security Registration_

Under the Companies Act 2006, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including where not
governed by English law) granted by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales (together with
prescribed particulars of the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of
Companies in England and Wales for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the
security constituted by the applicable security document. Such security, if not registered within the
21 day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and a creditor of the
applicable chargor. Further, failure to register also means that the debt which was intended to be
secured is deemed to have become immediately payable.

In the event that the relevant security document is not registered, it may be possible to apply to the
English courts for an order to rectify the position and allow the charge to be registered after the 21
day period has expired. This application can be made by a chargor incorporated in England and
Wales or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the
security out of time if it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard to
whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice
the position of creditors or shareholders. The court order will have to be enclosed with any delayed
application for registration of the security.


-----

Security created on or after October 1, 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and
Wales does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (although may still need to be
registered with the applicable asset registry). The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain
charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of Companies.

_Moratoriums_

As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for
the automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including
creditors are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights
and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing
administration (see “—Administration”), moratoriums are also available to companies entering
liquidation (see “—Liquidation/Winding-up”) and pursuant to the moratorium procedure under Part
A1 of the Insolvency Act (see “—Moratorium”).

_Restriction on the Operation and Exercise of Ipso Facto Provisions_

CIGA inserted a new permanent measure for the protection of supplies of goods and services into the
Insolvency Act. The measure provides that a provision of a contract for the supply of goods or
services which permits the supplier to terminate the contract or the supply, or do any other thing (e.g.
impose amended terms), on the grounds that the counterparty becomes subject to a relevant
insolvency procedure, will be void. A relevant insolvency procedure for this purpose includes
winding-up proceedings, administration, the standalone moratorium and the new restructuring plan
procedure, but not a scheme of arrangement.

Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e. other than as a result of the counterparty being
subject to a relevant insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises
after commencement of the insolvency proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the
contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents or if permission is granted
by the court on it being satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier
hardship.

The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved
in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial
leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and
agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market
investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act).

**The Netherlands**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated in the Netherlands. A Dutch company has its registered
office (statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands and it is therefore presumed (subject to proof to the
contrary and exceptions provided for in the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation) that a Dutch company
has its center of main interests in the Netherlands. That means that in the event of insolvency of a
Guarantor, insolvency proceedings with respect to those entities would likely be opened in the
Netherlands and, as a result, be governed by Dutch insolvency law. Dutch insolvency laws are
different from the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, and this may limit your ability to recover
payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.
There are circumstances under Dutch insolvency law in which the granting by a Dutch Guarantor of
security and guarantees can be challenged.

Under Dutch law, there are three insolvency proceedings that may be opened in respect of legal
entities. The first, suspension of payments (surseance van betaling or _moratorium), is intended to_
facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enables the debtor to continue as a going


-----

concern. The second, a pre-insolvency plan also known as the Dutch Scheme (onderhands akkoord),
is also intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as
a going concern. The third, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute
the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often
results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. These insolvency proceedings are set forth in the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of both insolvency
proceedings is set out below.

_Suspension (or moratorium) of payments_

A moratorium is a court ordered general suspension of a debtor’s obligations to its creditors. A
moratorium is available at the request of the debtor on the ground that the debtor foresees to be unable
to continue payments when they fall due and could be used as a defense by the debtor against a
bankruptcy application by a creditor. It may be ordered only by the district court located in the district
in which the company has its statutory seat. Upon the filing of the request for a moratorium, the court
located in the district in which the company has its statutory seat will immediately (dadelijk) grant the
moratorium on a provisional basis and appoint at least one administrator (bewindvoerder) of the
debtor’s estate. If a draft composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application
for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a
decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by
the court (gehomologeerd), which ratification will be final and binding (kracht van gewijsde hebben),
the provisional moratorium ends.

Subsequently, a court hearing of, among others, the unsecured non-preferential creditors is required to
decide on the definitive moratorium. The court will then decide whether to grant a definitive
moratorium or, alternatively, the court may declare the debtor bankrupt. The court will grant a
definitive moratorium unless such moratorium is (a) opposed by either (i) creditors having claims
jointly exceeding one quarter of the total amount of claims represented at the meeting or (ii) more
than one third in number of creditors whose claims are represented at the meeting or (b) if there is a
valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there
is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the debtor
must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that
creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within
the framework of a composition).

Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to
two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order, the
moratorium is only effective with regards to unsecured non-preferential creditors. A moratorium takes
effect retroactively until midnight on the day on which the court has granted the provisional
moratorium. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent,
(i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor
subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset.

_The Dutch Scheme_

As regards the pre-insolvency plan regime, as of January 1, 2021, debtors have the possibility to offer
a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings under the Act on Court Confirmation of
Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord) (the “WHOA”). The preinsolvency plan regime has been incorporated in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act pursuant to this WHOA.
Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy, a composition under the WHOA
can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alios, for cross
class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned
proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of ipso facto, and supporting court
measures. Such composition may result in claims against Dutch Guarantors as compromised if the
relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favor of such a composition.
A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated


-----

under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the
rights of holders of the Notes.

Under the WHOA, voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a
decision adopted with a majority of two third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or,
in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan.
The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting
class. Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors
that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan,
unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, _inter alios, refuse confirmation of a_
composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value
of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be
expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a
non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or
contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class. There is one mandatory refusal ground
specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity
swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt
for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of
such creditor.

Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a
possible extension of four months. During such period, inter alios, all enforcement action against the
assets of the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor.
Accordingly, during such stay, a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such
pledged claims of its rights of pledge. Claims of creditors against the Dutch Guarantors can be
compromised as a result of a composition plan adopted and confirmed in accordance with the WHOA.
A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated
under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands as long as those entities have a sufficient
connection with the jurisdiction of the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of
the holders of the Notes.

_Bankruptcy_

Bankruptcy is a court ordered general attachment of the assets of a debtor for the benefit of the
debtor’s collective creditors. In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the general principle is the so-called
_paritas creditorum (principal of equal treatment), which means that the purpose of bankruptcy is to_
provide for a liquidation and distribution of the proceeds of the debtor’s assets among its creditors in
accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. Bankruptcy may be ordered only by
the district court located in the district in which the company has its statutory seat. An application for
bankruptcy can be made by either (i) one or more creditors of the debtor, (ii) the public prosecutor (if
the public interest so requires) or (iii) the debtor itself, on the grounds that the debtor has ceased
paying its debts. A debtor is considered to have ceased paying its debts if it has more than one creditor
and if at least one of its payment obligations is due but unpaid.

As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets.
Furthermore, all pending executions of judgments and any attachments on the debtor’s assets (other
than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as further described below) will be
terminated by operation of law, and any pending litigation on the date of the bankruptcy order is
automatically suspended.

A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively until midnight on the day the order is rendered. In the
event of bankruptcy, a court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy (curator) at its own discretion,
which, in most cases, will be a practicing lawyer in the Netherlands. The receiver in bankruptcy
manages the bankrupt estate, which consists of all of the debtor’s assets and liabilities that exist on the
date on which the bankruptcy was opened, and of all assets acquired during the bankruptcy. The
bankruptcy estate is not liable for obligations incurred by the debtor after the bankruptcy order, except
to the extent that such obligations arise from transactions that are beneficial to the estate. A receiver in


-----

bankruptcy operates under the supervision of a supervisory judge (rechter-commissaris) designated by
the court, and thus most of a receiver in bankruptcy’s major decisions require the prior approval of the
supervisory judge.

There is no legal duty for a debtor or its managing board to file for bankruptcy. However, if the
managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when
they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of
trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a moratorium as described
above.

Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees (and in the case of suspension of payments,
preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)), can exercise their rights during
the bankruptcy or a moratorium as normal as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments
and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs. However, the bankruptcy judge may call a
“freeze order” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months imposed by court order
(which may be a total period of eight months if the similar statutory stay of execution is first applied
during suspension of payments), during which period the secured creditors cannot exercise their rights
unless such creditors have obtained a leave for enforcement from the bankruptcy judge. The receiver
in bankruptcy is authorized to make such forced sales in order to prevent a secured creditor from
delaying the enforcement of the security without good reason. If a receiver in bankruptcy does make a
forced sale of secured assets, the secured creditors have to contribute to the general bankruptcy
expenses (algemene faillissementskosten) and will receive payment from the proceeds of that sale
prior to ordinary, non-preferred creditors having an insolvency claim, but after creditors of the estate
(boedelschuldeisers), and subject to satisfaction of higher ranking claims of creditors. Furthermore,
certain preferred creditors (including the Dutch tax authorities (belastingdienst) and the social security
authorities) have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not
entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the
proceeds of the bankrupt’s debtor’s assets. Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may
apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be respected. Dutch tax authorities also have a
preferential claim in respect of the collection of certain taxes (for example, social security premiums,
wage tax, value added tax, etc.) on certain movable property found on the debtor’s premises
(bodemvoorrecht). They may take recourse against such property irrespective of whether any security
interests over such property exist. Excess proceeds of enforcement of security rights must be returned
to the debtor in bankruptcy and may not be set off against any unsecured claims that the secured
creditors may have. Such set off is, in principle, only allowed outside bankruptcy of the debtor.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims need to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for
verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy makes a preliminary determination as to the existence,
ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy
proceedings. Creditors that wish to dispute the verification of their claims by the receiver in
bankruptcy will be referred to the claim validation proceedings (renvooiprocedure) in order to
establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim.

Interest accruing after the date of the bankruptcy order cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge
or mortgage. In that event, interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an interest is not
covered by the proceeds of the security the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No
interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy.

A Dutch pledge can serve as security for monetary claims (geldvorderingen) only and can only be
enforced upon default (verzuim) of the obligations secured thereby. Foreclosure on pledged property
is to be carried out in accordance with the applicable provisions and limitations of the Dutch Civil
Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke
_Rechtsvordering)._

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Guarantees and Security Interests_**


-----

You may not be able to enforce, or recover any amounts under a guarantee of, and security interests
granted by or in, any Dutch Guarantor due to restrictions on the validity and enforceability of security
interests and guarantees under Dutch law. Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security
interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim purported to be secured by such
security interests. For that reason, the Security Documents pursuant to which a security interest under
Dutch law will be granted use a parallel debt structure, whereby the Dutch subsidiaries, as separate
and independent obligations, undertake to pay to the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes offered hereby amounts equal to the amounts due by it to the holders of the notes. Such
parallel debt structure therefore creates a separate and independent claim of the Security Agent for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes offered hereby which can be secured by a security interest.
Consequently, the security interests are granted to the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes offered hereby in its own capacity as creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel
debt, and not as a representative (vertegenwoordiger) of the creditors. It is expressly agreed in such a
parallel debt provision that the obligations of the debtor to the Security Agent for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes offered hereby shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal
obligations to the creditors are reduced (and vice versa). However, such a parallel debt structure has
never been tested before a Dutch court and we cannot assure that it will mitigate or eliminate the risk
of unenforceability posed by Dutch law.

Under Dutch law, receipt of any payment made by any Dutch Guarantor under a guarantee or security
interest may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Dutch
law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such guarantee or security interest.
The validity and enforceability of a guarantee of, or a security interest granted by or in, any Dutch
Guarantors may also be successfully contested by any Dutch Guarantors (or their receiver in
bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim, as further described below. The validity and
enforceability of the obligations of our Dutch subsidiaries under a guarantee or security interest may
also be successfully contested by any creditor, or by the subsidiaries’ respective receiver in
bankruptcy when the subsidiary is in bankruptcy proceedings, if such obligation is prejudicial to the
interests of any other creditor and the other requirements for voidable preference under the Dutch
Civil Code and Dutch Bankruptcy Act are met, as further described below. As a result, the value of
the guarantee and security interests provided by the Dutch Guarantors may be limited.

In the context of inquiry proceedings, a corporate resolution approving the issuance of a guarantee by
the Dutch company or a security to be provided by the Dutch company may be suspended or voided
by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeals in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het
_Gerechtshof Amsterdam) on the motion of,_ _inter alios, one or more holders of shares or depository_
receipts issued for shares in such company who, solely or jointly, represent at least one tenth of the
issued capital or who are entitled to an amount of in shares or depository receipts issued therefore
with a nominal value of €225,000 or such lesser amount as is provided by the articles of association
(statuten) of the relevant company, and persons who are authorized to do so by the articles of
association or under an agreement with such company. The right to file such motion is further vested
in an association of employees which has amongst its members person working for the enterprise and
which has at least two years full legal capacity, and, for reasons of public interest, the advocate
general at the Court of Appeals in Amsterdam. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be
upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or voided.

Pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or a security document governed by Dutch law
may be withheld under doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force
majeure (niet _toerekenbare_ _tekortkoming)_ and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene
_omstandigheden) and other defenses afforded by Dutch law to obligors generally. Other general_
defenses include claims that a guarantee or security interest should be avoided because it was entered
into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or
error (dwaling). Other impeding factors include rights of suspension (opschorting), a dissolution of a
contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening). Furthermore, the courts of the Netherlands may
change the effects of a contractual obligation on the basis of abuse of authority (misbruik van
_bevoegdheid). Moreover, enforcement of guarantees or security interests may be capable of being_


-----

rescinded (vernietigd) as a result of lack of consensus ad idem (wilsgebreken) and the legal
consequences thereof.

Pursuant to Article 2:7 of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek), any transaction entered into by
a legal entity may be nullified by the legal entity itself or its receiver in bankruptcy (curator) if the
objects of that entity as set out in the company’s articles of association (doeloverschrijding) were
transgressed by the transaction and the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this
without independent investigation (wist of zonder eigen onderzoek moest weten). The Dutch Supreme
Court (Hoge Raad der Nederlanden) has ruled that in determining whether the objects of a legal entity
are transgressed, not only the description of the objects in that legal entity’s articles of association
(statuten) is decisive, but all (relevant) circumstances must be taken into account, in particular
whether the transaction is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its
benefit; and whether the subsistence of the company is jeopardized by the transaction.

**_Fraudulent conveyance_**

Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of
bankruptcy, the so called _actio pauliana provisions. The_ _actio pauliana offers creditors protection_
against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without
limitations, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third
party and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the
relevant person and may be nullified by the receiver in bankruptcy in a bankruptcy of the relevant
person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if (i) the person performed
such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the
person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act
and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction
knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced
in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (om niet) in which
case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of
fraudulent conveyance. In addition, in the case of a bankruptcy, the receiver in bankruptcy may
nullify the performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an
obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die
_betaling ontving) knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of payment or (ii)_
the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and the payee
with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors.

**United States**

Some of the Guarantors and Collateral providers are subject to or organized under the laws of the
United States or certain states thereof. Under U.S. federal bankruptcy laws or comparable provisions
of state fraudulent transfer laws, under certain circumstances:

- the issuance of the Guarantees and the grant of security in the Collateral by entities subject to or
organized under the laws of the United States or certain states thereof (each, a “U.S. Provider”)
could be avoided;

- claims in respect of such Guarantees, liens or obligations could be subordinated to some or all of
a U.S. Provider’s other debts and other liabilities;

- the right of the Security Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral of a U.S. Provider upon
an event of default under the Indenture governing the Notes is likely to be significantly impaired
if such U.S. Provider commenced U.S. bankruptcy proceedings before such repossession or
disposal occurs; and

- the holders of the Notes could be required to repay any amounts received in connection with
such Guarantee or Collateral.


-----

**_Federal and State Insolvency Proceedings_**

Certain U.S. Providers may have operations that would subject any one or more either to federal
bankruptcy laws under title 11 of the United States Code (the “U.S. Bankruptcy Code”) or any
applicable state law insolvency proceedings. Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code vary and
provide a debtor with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy. The U.S.
Bankruptcy Code provides a detailed statutory framework that, among others, contains terms or
provisions relating to: (a) the administration of a bankruptcy case, including the provision of
“adequate protection” to secured creditors, the automatic stay, terms for the use, sale or lease of
property, standards for obtaining credit and the treatment of executory contracts and leases; (b)
creditors and claims, including filing proofs of claim, priority and allowance of claims, rights of
creditors and subordination of claims; (c) provisions relating to the creation of the bankruptcy estate,
including the scope of property of the estate and turnover and avoidance actions; liquidation under
chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code;
and ancillary and cross-border insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the
debtor’s assets by a trustee, and typically, a chapter 7 case results in the immediate shutdown of the
debtor’s business. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to
rehabilitate their businesses and work out their obligations to creditors. Unlike in chapter 7, the debtor
in a chapter 11 case typically remains in control of its assets and continues to operate its business
during the course of the bankruptcy case. In addition, “liquidating” chapter 11 cases may be utilized
as an alternative to chapter 7 liquidations, especially where the conversion of a pending chapter 11
case to a case under chapter 7 might prove prohibitively expensive or in an instance when a debtor
expects to sell all or substantially all of its assets. Because bankruptcy proceedings tend to be factspecific and vary case-by-case and because U.S. bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with broad
discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all of the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that
could impact the Notes, the Collateral or the Guarantees is not contained herein. Furthermore, the
common law applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this
summary is not intended to cover the common law that may apply in any particular jurisdiction.

With respect to proceedings under any applicable state insolvency laws (for example, assignments for
the benefit of creditors, receiverships or other state liquidation mechanisms) and the application of
state laws in bankruptcy proceedings, the effects and customs of these proceedings are fact-specific,
vary from state to state and require an examination of both statutory and common law, the details of
which also are not described herein. To the extent more information is required, potential investors in
the Notes should consult an insolvency professional familiar with U.S. and the applicable state
insolvency laws.

**_Delay and Risks Associated in a Federal Bankruptcy Proceeding_**

If a bankruptcy proceeding were to be commenced under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code by or against any
U.S. Provider, it is likely that delays will occur in enforcing the Guarantees or Collateral granted by
the bankrupt U.S. Provider, because of specific provisions of such laws or by a court applying general
principles of equity. Aspects of federal bankruptcy laws or general principles of equity that could
result in the impairment of rights include, but are not limited to:

- the automatic stay;

- avoidance of preferential transfers by a trustee or debtor-in-possession;

- substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of multiple entities;

- limitations on collectability of unmatured interest or attorney fees;

- fraudulent transfer; and


-----

- forced restructuring of the debt issued by the bankrupt company, including reduction of
principal amounts and interest rates and extension of maturity dates, or the conversion of debt to
equity interests, other forms of consideration (such as interests in a trust), or potential discharge
of all obligations without significant recovery, over the creditors’ objections.

As an initial matter, the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code operates as a stay,
applicable to all creditors, of most litigation against the debtor and efforts to collect prepetition
claims, enforce existing liens or impose most new liens. The stay applies to the debtor and its assets
globally. The purpose of the stay is to provide the chapter 11 debtor time to reorganize and the chapter
7 trustee protection under which to liquidate in an orderly fashion the debtor’s assets for the benefit of
creditors. The automatic stay is also intended to shield a debtor from the pressures of creditor
collection efforts. Among others, the automatic stay prohibits (a) all collection efforts by creditors, (b)
the enforcement of prepetition judgments against the debtor or property of the estate, (c) any act to
create, perfect or enforce a lien against property of the estate and (d) the set off of prepetition debts
owing to the debtor against debts owing by the debtor. The automatic stay ordinarily does not bar
suits against non-debtor guarantors or co-obligors, nor does it enjoin payment under a letter of credit
issued by a bank in favor of a creditor of the applicable debtor. Applicable federal bankruptcy laws
generally do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorney’s fees for unsecured or
“undersecured” claims.

**_Fraudulent Transfer Issues_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, the
issuance of Guarantees or provisions of Collateral by any U.S. Providers could be avoided if, among
others, at the time the U.S. Providers issued the Guarantees or provided Collateral (as the case may
be), the applicable U.S. Provider (a) intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future
creditor; or (b) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence
of such indebtedness and, in the case of (b) either:

- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the U.S. Provider’s remaining assets
constituted unreasonably small capital; or

- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as
they mature.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon
the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a U.S. Provider
would be considered insolvent if:

- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than all of its assets, at a fair
valuation;

- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to
pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

- it could not pay its debts as they become due.

However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency
determinations, and different courts may reach different conclusions with regards to these issues. In
an evidentiary ruling in the In re W.R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy case, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
the District of Delaware held that under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, whether a transferor is
rendered insolvent by a transfer depends on the actual liabilities of the transferor, and not what the
transferor knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer. Therefore, under that court’s
analysis, liabilities that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully


-----

appreciated at the time of the transfer, may be taken into account in the context of a future
determination of insolvency. If the principle articulated by that court is applied, it would make it very
difficult to know whether a transferor is solvent at the time of transfer, and would increase the risk
that a transfer may in the future be found to be a fraudulent transfer.

By their terms, the Guarantees of each U.S. Provider will limit the liability of each such guarantor to
the maximum amount it can pay without the Guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer. It is not
assured, however, that this limitation will protect such Guarantee from fraudulent transfer challenges
or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the Guarantee would suffice, if
necessary, to pay the Notes in full when due. In a recent Florida bankruptcy case, this kind of
provision was found to be ineffective to protect the guarantees.

In addition to the avoidance power that may be exercised in a U.S. bankruptcy, claims in respect of
liens or obligations evidenced by the Guarantees or Collateral may, in certain circumstances, be
subordinated under the equitable subordination provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_Preference Issues_**

Any future pledge of Collateral by a U.S. Provider might be avoidable by the pledgor (as debtor-inpossession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including,
among others, if the pledgor is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the pledgee to
receive a greater recovery than it would otherwise receive in a hypothetical liquidation under chapter
7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor is commenced
within 90 days following the pledge, or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.

**Italy**

**_Introduction_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other
jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency
process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of
security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in
jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not
include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out
certain reserved activities nor does it provide a comprehensive description of insolvency laws
applicable to public companies.

Insolvency laws and regulations have been reviewed and significantly amended (the “2019 Reform”).
In particular, on October 11, 2017, the Italian Senate approved Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017
pursuant to which it has authorized the government to carry out a substantial reform of Italian
insolvency laws, on the basis of the guidelines provided therein, also taking into account the
recommendation of the EU Commission of March 12, 2014 on business failure and insolvency, which
in turn formed the basis for the draft EU directive on preventive restructuring frameworks currently
under discussion. The main amendments include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankruptcy”
(fallimento) due to its negative connotation and its replacement with a reference to a judicial
liquidation, (ii) the introduction of a definition of state of crisis, (iii) the adoption of the same
procedural framework to access the different insolvency procedures provided by law, (iv) express
acknowledgement and adoption of the definition of debtor’s COMI as provided for in the Recast
Insolvency Regulation, (v) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings, (vi) restrictions to the
use of the composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going-concern
restructurings, (vii) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency and (viii)
jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors.


-----

In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14 of
January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017,
which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, _inter alios, insolvency_
matters. The Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale
on February 14, 2019 no. 38—Suppl. Ordinario no. 6, and, except for minor changes in some
provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which entered into force on March 16, 2019, the new insolvency
code entered into force on July 15, 2022 in the text largely amended by Legislative Decree No. 83
dated June 17, 2022, which transposed the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 (the “New
Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law”) and replaced the Italian Royal Decree No. 267. of March 16,
1942, as in force before (the “Old Italian Bankruptcy Law”).

**_Certain Italian Insolvency Laws_**

Leaving aside the 2019 Reform, the Old Italian Bankruptcy Law saw many reforms in the near past.
In particular, a significant reform has been approved by the Italian Government on June 23, 2015
through a law-decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alios, to the Old Italian Bankruptcy
Law (the “2015 Decree”). The 2015 Decree entered into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication
in the _Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by the Italian Law No. 132/2015 (“Law_
132”). Law 132 entered into force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta
_Ufficiale). Subsequent amendments have thereafter been implemented by means of the adoption of (a)_
the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016,
and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016.

The primary aim of the Old Italian Bankruptcy Law used to be to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the
satisfaction of creditors’ claims (with the continuation of the assets as a going-concern (when
applicable) only if this would satisfy a creditor’s claim). These competing aims have often been
balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred
along with the businesses being sold. However, the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law has
changed approach with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the
continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-insolvency
restructuring options.

The New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law regulates situations of crisis or insolvency (as defined
pursuant to article 2 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law) of the debtor, whether consumer
or professional, or entrepreneur exercising, including not for profit, commercial, craft or agricultural
business, operating as an individual, legal person or other collective entity, group of enterprises or
public company, excluding the State and public entities. In particular, the following debt restructuring
and insolvency proceedings are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for
insolvent companies:

(a) consumers may be subject to:

(i) the consumer over-indebtedness procedure (ristrutturazione dei debiti del consumatore)
pursuant to article 67 (the “Over-Indebtedness Procedure”) of the New Italian Crisis and
Insolvency Law; and

(ii) controlled judicial liquidation (liquidazione controllata) pursuant to articles 268 and ff.
of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law (the “Controlled Liquidation”);

(b) sole traders and enterprises falling under the category of “small enterprises” may be subject
to:

(i) moratoria (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to article 62 of the New Italian Crisis and
Insolvency Law (“Moratoria”);

(ii) minor composition with creditors (concordato minore) pursuant to articles 74 and ff. of
the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law (the “Minor Composition with Creditors”);


-----

(iii) the negotiated composition (composizione negoziata della crisi) pursuant to articles 12
and following of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law (“Negotiated
Restructuring”);

(iv) the Controlled Liquidation; and

(c) entrepreneurs (imprenditori) that meet the following requirements: (1) annual assets in excess
of Euro 300,000 for the three previous fiscal years or, since the business activity commenced
if for a shorter period; (2) gross income in excess of Euro 200,000 during the same time
frame; and (3) debts, whether matured or unmatured, in excess of Euro 500,000, may be
subject to:

(i) judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) in accordance with the provisions of articles
121 and following of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law (“Judicial
Liquidation”);

(ii) preventative composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) pursuant to articles 84
and following of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law (“Composition with
Creditors”);

(iii) out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56
of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law (“Out-of-Court Reorganization Plans”);

(iv) homologated restructuring plans and agreement pursuant to articles 57 and ff. of the New
Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, which include the following out of court arrangements
subject to court homologation: (A) restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione
_dei debiti) (“Hybrid Debt Restructuring”), which may also have extended effects, and (B)_
Moratoria;

(v) homologated reorganization plan (piano di ristrutturazione omologato), pursuant to
articles 64-bis and ff. of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law (“Homologated
Restructuring”); and

###### (vi) negotiated nestructuring.

**_Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process (Accordi Stragiudiziali)_**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for
the debtor and because arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring (other
than the ones entered into in execution of one of the legal tools described below) are vulnerable to
being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as
voidable transactions. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties,
it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard
the existence of the company.

**_Out-of-Court Reorganization Plans (Piani Attestati di Risanamento)_**

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento
_attestati)._ In particular, pursuant to article 56 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, an
entrepreneur, including non-commercial one, in a state of crisis or insolvency, may prepare a plan,
addressed to creditors, in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their
financial condition. The plan shall: (a) allow the company's debt exposure to be restructured and (b)
ensure the rebalancing of the company's financial situation, and its reasonableness shall be certified
by an expert. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the
restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need
to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional
and independence requirements and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399
of the Italian _codice civile, approved by the Royal Decree No. 262 of March 16, 1942 (as_
subsequently amended and restated, the “Italian Civil Code”) and may be subject to liability in case of


-----

misrepresentation or false certification. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable.
Unlike Composition with Creditor and Hybrid Debt Restructuring agreements, out-of-court
reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or
precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law provides
that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared insolvent, payments, acts and/or activities
carried out as part of the implementation of a reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are
not subject to claw-back action, save in case of wilful misconduct or gross negligence of the expert or
the debtor of which the creditor was aware at the time of the performance of the act, payment or
granting of the security and, (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal
sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Italian Companies’ Register are
needed (although publication in the Italian Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request
and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue
judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-insolvency agreement or a debt restructuring
agreement.

**_Hybrid Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors (Accordi di Ristrutturazione dei Debiti)_**

Pursuant to Article 57 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, the entrepreneur, including noncommercial enterprises, except for the small enterprises, who is in a state of crisis or insolvency,
could enter into a debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)
representing at least 60% of the outstanding company’s debts to be ratified by the court. However,
pursuant to Article 60 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, the 60 % requirement is reduced
by half if: (a) the debtor has not requested temporary protective measures; and (b) creditors that are
not party to the agreements are liquidated in a timely manner. An independent expert appointed by the
debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and
declare that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the debts of the nonparticipating creditors can be fully satisfied within a 120 day term from: (i) the date of ratification of
the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating
creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the
court; or (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of receivables which are not yet due
and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the
debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a state of crisis (i.e.,
facing financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request
the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement entered into with its
creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its
publication.

If requested, protective measures apply from the date of deposit of the petition for the homologation
of the Hybrid Debt Restructuring agreement, provided that protective measures can be requested also
during negotiations of the Hybrid Debt Restructuring agreement. In particular, if protective measures
are requested, from the day of publication, the creditors concerned may not acquire rights of preemption unless agreed with the debtor nor may they begin or continue executive and precautionary
actions on his assets or on the property and rights with which the business activity is exercised.
However, (i) creditors cannot unilaterally refuse to perform or terminate existing contracts only since
the Hybrid Debt Restructuring petition has been filed; and (ii) creditors in respect of which protective
measures apply cannot unilaterally refuse to perform or terminate existing essential contracts solely as
a consequence of the failure to pay in respect of pre-existing claims.

The New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning
the contents of the Hybrid Debt Restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alios,
either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business
to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or postponements
of claims. The Hybrid Debt Restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for
the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.


-----

Pursuant to Article 61 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, the debtor may ask to extend the
effects of the Hybrid Debt Restructuring agreement to creditors that are not part of it (accordi di
_ristrutturazione ad efficacia estesa) (i.e._ the “Hybrid Debt Restructuring with Extended Effects”),
provided that, inter alios, (a) all creditors of the relevant classes were notified of the negotiations and
had the chance to participate in the negotiations¸ (b) the restructuring plan provides for the business
continuation (provided that this requirement does not apply to extensions of the Hybrid Debt
Restructuring agreement made to banks and financial intermediaries); (c) the participating creditors
hold at least 75% of the claims of the relevant class; and (d) the non-participating creditors are repaid
for an amount at least equal to what they would have obtained through liquidation. In any case, the
Hybrid Debt Restructuring with Extended Effects cannot impose on non-adhering creditors the
performance of new obligations, the granting or maintenance of the availability of credit lines and the
granting of new facilities. Non-adhering creditors can file an opposition starting from the date of the
notification of the negotiations.

**_Moratoria (Convenzione di Moratoria)_**

Pursuant to Article 62 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, an entrepreneur (including those
involved in non-commercial activities) and its creditors may enter into moratoria agreement
(convenzione di moratoria) in order to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis by obtaining a
payments postponement, waiver of judicial proceedings or suspension of enforcement measures.
Moratoria is also effective towards non-participating creditors of the same class of the participating
creditors, provided that under no circumstances, as a result of the agreement, the non-adhering
creditors may be required to perform new services, grant credit lines, maintain existing credit lines or
disburse new financing. For the purpose of being approved and effective against non-participating
creditors:

(a) all creditors belonging to the same category shall have been informed of the negotiations and
had the chance to participate;

(b) the participating creditors shall represent at least 75% of all creditors belonging to the same
class;

(c) there is a real prospect that non-participating creditors to whom the effects of the agreement
are extended, may be satisfied as a result of the agreement to an extent not less than what they
would obtain from a Judicial Liquidation;

(d) an independent expert certifies the truthfulness of company data, the suitability of the
agreement and the fulfilment of the conditions referred to in letter (c).

Non-adhering creditors can file an opposition within 30 days from the notification of the Moratoria.

**_Homologated Restructuring (Piano di ristrutturazione soggetto a omologazione)_**

Pursuant to Articles 64-bis and ff. of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, the entrepreneur,
other than small enterprises, involved in commercial activities and in a state of crisis or insolvency,
may distribute for the satisfaction of its creditors, subject to their division into classes according to
homogeneous legal position and economic interests, the value generated by the plan by way of
derogation from Articles 2740 (which provides that the debtor shall be liable for the performance of
obligations with all his present and future assets) and 2741 (which provides that creditors have an
equal right to be satisfied on the debtor's assets, subject to legitimate causes of pre-emption) of the
Italian Civil Code and from the provisions governing the graduation of legitimate causes of preemption, provided that the proposal for the restructuring plan is approved by all the classes of
creditors.

For each class of creditors, the proposal is approved if a majority of the claims allowed to vote is
reached or, failing that, if two thirds of voting creditors have voted in favour, provided that creditors
holding at least half of the total claims of the class have voted. Creditors with a right of pre-emption


-----

do not vote if satisfied in cash and in full, within one hundred and eighty days from the approval,
provided that the relevant collateral remains in place until the liquidation of the assets made for the
purpose of completing the payment in their favour. If the conditions set forth above are not met, the
creditors with a right of pre-emption shall be entitled vote and any residual unsecured claim shall be
allocated to the relevant different class.

If a dissenting creditor objects to the economic convenience of the restructuring proposal, the court
can approve the Homologated Restructuring proposal if it ensures the satisfaction of the claim in an
amount at least equal to the one that would be paid in the Judicial Liquidation.

**_Negotiated Restructuring (Composizione negoziata della crisi)_**

The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding that can be pursued, through an
online platform, by commercial enterprises (imprenditore commerciale) and agricultural enterprises
(imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with reference to their assets, their
business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow. No
Negotiated Restructuring can be commenced if a petition has been already filed for a Composition
with Creditors, a Hybrid Debt Restructuring, an Over-Indebtedness Procedure or a Judicial
Liquidation proceeding.

The Negotiated Restructuring can be commenced on a voluntary basis only, with the filing of a
petition for the appointment of a third party and independent expert (the “Expert”). If the Expert finds
that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved in
the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings.
During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must
cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried out
or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received during the negotiations. If the Expert
finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the
entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she notifies the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the relevant
Chamber of Commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. In case of
small enterprises, the appointment of the Expert can be requested irrespectively of the recovery
prospects of the Small Enterprise.

The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 calendar days from its appointment,
the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the
entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue for up to an
additional 180 days if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees,
or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by a petition filed by the entrepreneur with the
court. Furthermore, the entrepreneur can request, together with the petition for appointment of the
Expert or with a subsequent petition, the implementation of protective measures, which would involve
that from the date of publication of the relevant petition, pre-existing creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and
interim actions are stayed, which may last from 30 days to 120 days, extendable to a maximum of 240
days.

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the protective measures until
the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert,
the entrepreneur cannot be declared insolvent by the court. The creditors whose rights are affected by
the protective measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts in
place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor
amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed
payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the
protective measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the protective measures, he must simultaneously file the same request
to the competent court, to allow a judge to check the said protective measures and to confirm them or,


-----

if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the protective measures will be
ineffective. Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert,
the protective measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the
purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations or appear to be disproportionate compared to the
prejudice caused to the creditors that file the relevant request. In the event of cancellation or
termination of the protective measures, the prohibition to acquire pre-emptive rights unless agreed
with the entrepreneur shall cease as from the cancellation or termination of the protective measures.

Pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and,
upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments
non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid
prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the
negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the
entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors.

If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the
perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If,
notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur
gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration in the
companies’ register.
The court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the
continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery,
may authorize:

- the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior
indebtedness pursuant to Article 6 of New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law;

- the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness via shareholders’ financing; and

- the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided
under Article 2560, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the
court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking into account the requests of the
parties concerned, in order to protect the interests of all relevant parties involved.

The Negotiated Restructuring can terminate as follow:

A. in case of entrepreneurs other than small enterprises:

(i) in case of positive outcome:

(a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors with the
effects set out in article 25-bis, paragraph 1, of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency
Law;

(b) execution of a Moratoria; and

(c) execution of Out-of-Court Restructuring agreement.

(ii) if, at the end of the negotiations no solution is found:

(a) draw up an Out-of-Court Restructuring agreement referred to in Article 56 of the New
Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law;

(b) apply for the ratification of a Hybrid Debt Restructuring agreement pursuant to
Articles 57, 60 and 61 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law;


-----

(c) file an application for simplified Composition with Creditors with liquidation purpose
referred to in Article 25-sexies of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law;

(d) access one of the crisis and insolvency regulation instruments governed by the New
Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law.

B. in case of small enterprises:

(i) in case of positive outcome:

(a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors aimed at
the continuation of the business, without effects against third party creditors;

(b) execution of a Moratoria; and

(c) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors with the
effects set out in article 25-bis, paragraph 1, of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency
Law.

(ii) If, at the end of the negotiations no solution among those referred above is found:

(e) file for a Minor Composition with Creditors;

(f) file a petition for Controlled Liquidation;

(g) file an application for simplified Composition with Creditors with liquidation purpose
referred to in Article 25-sexies of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law;

(h) for agricultural enterprises only, file a petition for Hybrid Debt Restructuring.

Pursuant to Article 24 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, inter alios, the acts authorized
by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law shall remain
effective if any of the following is subsequently commenced: a ratified Hybrid Debt Restructuring
agreement, a ratified Composition with Creditors agreement, an Hybrid Debt Restructuring agreement
proposed pursuant to Article 64-bis of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency, the opening of a Judicial
Liquidation proceeding, a compulsory liquidation, an extraordinary administration or simplified
Composition with Creditors with liquidation purpose referred to in Article 25-sexies of the New
Italian Crisis and Insolvency.

The acts, payments and guarantees made by the entrepreneur in the period following the Expert's
acceptance of the assignment shall not be subject to claw-back referred to in Article 166, paragraph 2,
provided that they are consistent with the course and state of negotiations and the prospects of
reorganisation existing at the time they were made.

Article 25-sexies of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law also introduces a simplified courtsupervised pre-insolvency composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato
_semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio). Specifically, if the Expert states in its final report_
that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have been conducted according to fairness
and in good faith, and that the other outcomes are not feasible, within 60 days following the
notification of the final report of the Expert, the entrepreneur may file a petition for admission to the
_concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio_ together with the liquidation plan. The
entrepreneur applies for approval of the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione by means of an
appeal to the court of the place where the company has its centre of main interests. The application
shall be communicated to the public prosecutor and published by the clerk of the court in the
commercial register no later than the day following the date of filing in the registry. From the date of
such publication, the effects provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the New Italian Crisis and
Insolvency Law apply.


-----

The court issues a decree approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws_
and regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is
compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible; and (iii)
the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case
of Judicial Liquidation of the entrepreneur and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain
recovery.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after
having been notified of the same.

**_Composition with Creditors (Concordato Preventivo)_**

An entrepreneur which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e. financial distress which does not yet
amount to insolvency) and that has not been subject to the Judicial Liquidation proceeding, has the
option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose
its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency
and the initiation of Judicial Liquidation proceedings. Only the debtor company can initially file a
petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan
and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the
truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). Petitions may also be
filed “con riserva”, pursuant to which the debtor may request a deferral to formulate an application
for access to such procedure by attaching the documents required by law. The court may grant a 30 to
60 days deferral (extendable by a further 60 days if there are justified reasons) within which the
debtor must file the proposal for Composition with Creditors. The petition for concordato preventivo
is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the
date on which the court sanctions the _concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief_
actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo
by the court) are stayed. However, pursuant to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the New Italian Crisis and
Insolvency Law, the protective measures only apply if expressly requested by and approved by the
Court. In addition, the debtor may ask to the court, also after the admission to the Composition with
Creditors with subsequent request, further temporary measures in order to prevent certain actions of
one or more creditors that could prejudice the successful outcome of the initiatives taken to regulate
the state of crisis or insolvency. In case of Composition with Creditors with business continuity
creditors cannot unilaterally refuse to perform or terminate (i) existing contracts only for the reason
that the Composition with Creditors proceeding petition has been filed or the procedure commenced,
and (ii) in respect of which protective measures apply, existing essential contracts solely as a
consequence of the failure to pay in respect of pre-existing claims. Furthermore, pursuant to Article
46, paragraph 5, of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, pre-existing creditors cannot acquire
pre-emption rights effective vis-à-vis competing creditors (unless authorized by the court) and judicial
mortgages registered within the ninety days preceding the date on which the petition for the
Composition with Creditors is published in the companies' register are ineffective against such preexisting creditors.

The Composition with Creditors may provide either for the continuation or the liquidation of the
business. The composition proposal, by way of example, may provide for: (a) the restructuring of
debts and the satisfaction of creditors in any manner; (b) the transfer to a third party who undertakes
the debts (assuntore) of the operations of the business involved in the proposed composition
agreement; (c) the division of creditors into classes; and (d) different treatments for creditors
belonging to different classes. The composition plan which provides for the liquidation of the business
requires that the following two conditions are met: (a) unsecured creditors shall be satisfied for at
least 20% of their claim amount; and (b) the proposal envisages the provision of additional resources,
increasing the debtor’s assets of at least 10%. In an arrangement with continuation of the business,
creditors are satisfied, at least in part, for the direct or indirect proceeds deriving from the
continuation of the activities, also taking into account the value of contract renewals.


-----

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice
_delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali)_
and calls a creditors’ meeting. Pursuant to Article 109 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law,
the composition plan must be approved, through a telematic voting procedure, by creditors
representing a majority of claims entitled to vote (including preferred or secured creditors regarding
those claims to which they have waived their right to security in relation to the procedure or that are
not to be satisfied pursuant to the recovery plan). Where different classes of creditors are formed, the
composition plan is approved if it is approved by a majority of the claims admitted to the vote of each
class (or, in in the hypothesis of Composition with Creditors with business continuity, if such
requirement is not met, with the favourable vote of at least 2/3 of the creditors representing at least
half of the claims) and the majority of the classes (or all classes in the hypothesis of Composition with
Creditors with business continuity). Creditors with a lien, pledge or mortgage, even if the collateral is
contested, whose payment in full is provided for in the composition proposal, shall not be entitled to
vote unless they waive their preference right in whole or in part. If creditors waive their preference
rights in whole or in part, they shall be treated in the same way as unsecured creditors for the part of
the claim not covered by the security. Creditors with a preferred right, whose claims will be satisfied
only in part on the basis of the composition proposal, shall be treated in the same way as unsecured
creditors for the residual part of their claim.

Pursuant to Article 90 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law those who represent at least 10%
of the claims against the debtor, may submit a different composition proposal (proposta concorrente)
and the related plan no later than thirty days prior to the initial date set for the creditors to vote on the
proposal filed by the debtor. The _proposta concorrente will be admissible only if the debtor’s_
composition proposal does not guarantee the payment of at least 30% of the unsecured receivables.
This percentage is reduced to 20% where the debtor has successfully entered into a Negotiated
Restructuring.

When more proposals have been filed, these are all presented to the creditors for their vote and the
approved proposal is the one that receives more votes. In case of tie, the debtor’s proposal prevails, or
if the tie is between creditors’ proposals, the one filed earlier prevails. In any case, if none of the
proposals is approved with the majority mentioned above, the proposal that has obtained more votes is
presented again for approval.

Article 111 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law provides that, if within the time limit set for
the conclusion of the voting operations, the required majorities are not reached, the designated judge
shall immediately address the court by asking for the opening of the Judicial Liquidation proceeding.
If, conversely, the composition plan is approved, the court must ratify the composition plan and
decide on possible objections raised by dissenting creditors.

During the implementation of the composition plan, the company is managed by the debtor under the
supervision of a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) appointed by the court and of the
court. Pursuant to article 113 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law the procedure ends with
the judgment of ratification by the court. On the contrary, if the Composition with Creditors fails, the
court may declare the opening of the Judicial Liquidation proceeding.

In addition, pursuant to Article 96 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, the solvency set-off
rules envisaged under Article 155 apply also to the Composition with Creditors as of the date of
submission of the petition for the Composition with Creditors.

Moreover, under Article 97 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, the debtor may request the
competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o
_non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the_
above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), preliminary sale
agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita), real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di
_immobili), etc.). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_
application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made


-----

after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be
suspended for a period of time not exceeding the period stated by the competent court. In such
circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages
suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and
outside of the admission to the composition.

**_Minor Composition with Creditors (Concordato Minore)_**

Pursuant to Article 74 and ff. of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, professionals, small
enterprises, agricultural entrepreneur, start innovative start-ups and any other debtor not subject to
Judicial Liquidation, excluding consumers, in a state of over-indebtedness, may formulate to their
creditors a proposal for a composition with creditors allowing the continuance of their business
activity. If the Minor Composition with Creditors does not allow for the business continuity, it may
only be proposed when it envisages the contribution of external resources that appreciably increase
the satisfaction of the creditors.

The proposal must be filed to the court through a crisis resolution body together with a report from the
crisis resolution body covering, among other things, the causes of indebtedness, the debtor's diligence
in assuming the obligations and the reasons for the inability to fulfil the obligations. The proposal for
a Minor Composition with Creditors can have any content, shall specifically indicate the timeframe
and modalities for overcoming the over-indebtedness status and may provide for the satisfaction, also
in part, of receivables in any form, as well as the possible division of creditors into classes. The
provisions governing the Composition with Creditors apply save as otherwise provided.

**_Over-Indebtedness Procedures (Ristrutturazione dei debiti del consumatore)_**

Articles 67 and ff. of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law envisage a debt restructuring
procedure for consumers who are in a state of over-indebtedness. Specifically, the consumer may
propose to its creditors a plan that specifically indicates timeframes and methods for overcoming the
over-indebtedness. A consumer is considered not eligible and, consequently, cannot have access to
such procedure if it: (a) has already obtained a debt relief in the previous five years or otherwise
twice; (b) has determined over-indebtedness through gross negligence, bad faith or fraud.

The proposal made by the consumer can have any content and may provide for the satisfaction, also in
part and differentiated, of claims in any form and must be accompanied by the list of: (a) all creditors,
with an indication of the amounts due and the pre-emption rights; (b) description of its assets; (c) the
acts of extraordinary administration performed in the last five years; (d) income tax returns for the last
three years; (e) the salaries, pensions, wages and all other income of the debtor and his household,
with an indication of what is necessary for the maintenance of his family. The proposal may also
provide for the restructuring of debts arising from loan agreements with assignment of one-fifth of
salary (contratti di cessione del quinto), severance pay or pension and from loans secured by pledges,
as well as the possibility to provide for the partial satisfaction of secured claims provided that the
payment is at least equal to what they would receive from the liquidation of the secured assets based
on their market value.

The application must be submitted to the court through a crisis resolution body (organo di
_composizione della crisi)_ with the latter's report attached, which must contain: (a) a statement of the
causes of indebtedness and the diligence employed by the debtor in assuming the obligations; (b) a
statement of the reasons for the debtor's inability to fulfil the obligations undertaken; (c) an
assessment of the completeness and reliability of the documentation filed in support of the
application; (d) an estimation of the costs of the proceedings.

According to Article 70 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, the court, if it deems the plan
admissible, shall order by decree the online publication in the appropriate area of the court or the
Ministry of Justice’s website and that all creditors be notified within thirty days. Within twenty days
after the notice, any creditor may submit comments. Upon request of the debtor, the court may order


-----

the prohibition of executive and interim relief actions on the debtor's assets and envisage other
protective measures until the conclusion of the proceedings.

The judge, having verified the legal admissibility and economic feasibility of the plan and resolved
any disputes, ratify the plan by judgment. When one of the creditors or any other interested party
disputes the appropriateness of the proposal, the court may likewise ratify the plan if it considers that
in any case the claim of the opponent can be satisfied by the execution of the plan to for an amount
not lower than what it would receive through the Controlled Liquidation. If the plan is not
homologated by the court, the judge may open, upon request of the debtor and where the conditions
are met, the proceeding for the Controlled Liquidation of the over-indebted.

**_Controlled Liquidation (Liquidazione Controllata)_**

Pursuant to Articles 268 and ff. of the of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, professionals,
small enterprises, agricultural entrepreneur, innovative start-ups, and any other debtor not subject to a
Judicial Liquidation proceeding, if in a state of over-indebtedness, may apply to the competent court
for the opening a Controlled Liquidation proceeding of their assets.

When the debtor is in a state of insolvency, the petition for Controlled Liquidation may be filed by a
creditor even while individual enforcement proceedings are pending, provided that no Controlled
Liquidation can be commenced in such case if the amount of unpaid debt is lower than Euro
50,000.00. In addition, when the application is made by a creditor against a debtor who is a physical
person, there shall be no opening of such proceeding if the crisis resolution body, at the request of the
debtor, certifies that it is not possible to acquire assets to be distributed to creditors even through the
exercise of judicial actions. The application may be filed also by the public prosecutor, but only if the
over-indebtedness concerns entrepreneurs.

The judge, having ascertained the absence of alternative applications for the Over-Indebtedness
Procedure or Minor Composition with Creditors, declares the procedure open and appoints the
designated judge and the liquidator. Pursuant to Article 271 of the of the New Italian Crisis and
Insolvency Law, if the application for a Controlled Liquidation proceeding is proposed by creditors or
by the public prosecutor and the debtor requests access to an alternative procedure, the court shall
grant to him a time limit for supplementing the application. During such period, the Controlled
Liquidation proceeding cannot be opened and the related application is declared unsuccessful when an
alternative procedure of settlement of the crisis of the over-indebted has been opened. If, the debtor
fails to supplement the application or the alternative settlement procedure is not opened or is declared
terminated, the court orders the opening of the Controlled Liquidation proceeding.

Upon opening of the Controlled Liquidation all individual actions of creditors are stayed (subject to
certain exemptions) and creditors shall concur in the same manner (save as for any preference rights)
on the assets of the debtor. Furthermore, the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending
as of the date of the declaration of the Controlled Liquidation are suspended until the receiver decides
whether to take them over.

**_Judicial Liquidation (Liquidazione Giudiziale)_**

A request to declare a debtor insolvent and to commence a judicial liquidation proceedings (
_liquidazione giudiziale) for the judicial liquidation of its assets shall be made by means of an appeal to_
the competent court that can be filed (within one year from the termination of the business activity, if
the insolvency arose before the termination, or within the following year) by the debtor, the
supervisory bodies and administrative authorities performing control and supervisory functions over
the company, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is
insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, occurs when a
debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due.
Judicial Liquidation is declared by the competent insolvency court.


-----

Upon the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings, amongst other things, subject to certain
exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period. In
particular:

- claims secured by a pledge or secured by a lien pursuant to Articles 2756 and 2761 of the Italian
Civil Code may be realised outside the Judicial Liquidation also during the proceedings, after
they have been admitted as preferred claims, together with interests and expenses. In order to be
authorised to sell the secured assets, the creditor shall apply to the designated judge, who, after
hearing the receiver (curatore) and the creditors' committee, shall establish by decree the time of
the sale and determine the procedures to be followed pursuant to Article 216 of the New Italian
Crisis and Insolvency Law. The designated judge may assign the assets to the creditor who has
made the request and shall provide for the valuation of the assets subject to the authorisation or
assignment order. If the proceeds of the sale, net of expenses, or, in the case of an assignment,
the appraised value is higher than the amount of the claim with pre-emption rights, the creditor
shall pay the excess to the liquidator. The designated judge, after hearing the creditors'
committee, if one has been appointed, may also authorise the receiver to take back the pledged
or preferential assets, paying the creditor, or to carry out the sale;

- the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the receiver
(curatore);

- continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater
damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause
damage to creditors;

- any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and
in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings,
other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors;

- the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the declaration of
the judicial liquidation are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.
Although the general rule is that the receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all
of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules
expressly provided for by the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law; and

- pursuant to Article 155 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, creditors have a special
right of legal set-off, providing that creditors have the right to set-off their debts owed to the
insolvent against their claims towards it, even if the latter are not yet matured at the time of the
declaration of insolvency. However, for the purpose of set-off, the creditors’ claims need to be
(i) unconditional and (ii) able to be promptly determined in their specific amount according to
clear and specific criteria.

Judicial Liquidation proceedings are carried out under the direction of the receiver and supervised
by a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The receiver is not a representative
of the creditors and is responsible for the management and liquidation of the assets of the debtor to
the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed to the creditors whose
claims have been filed and approved by the court in accordance with statutory priority. The
liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the
debtor’s assets include real property. The New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law provides for
priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and
judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of
law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those
commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian
insolvency estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law).


-----

- Judicial Liquidation composition with creditors (concordato). Judicial Liquidation proceedings
can terminate prior to liquidation through a composition proposal with creditors. The relevant
proposal can be filed, by one or more creditors or third parties, from the declaration of
insolvency. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such proposal
after one year following such declaration, but within two years following the decree giving
effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote
on the proposal of _concordato, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the_
_concordato provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their_
secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can
vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal.

The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different
treatment among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims
in any manner. The concordato proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the
creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority
(by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required.
After the confirmation, the court closes the Judicial Liquidation proceeding and the enforcement
phase of the composition with creditors begins.

- Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Old Italian Bankruptcy
Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain
other EU jurisdictions. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from the rules of statutory
priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another
based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of
payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not
be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the
priorities provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the
proceeds are derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single
asset.

Article 221 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law establishes that proceeds of
liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “pre
deductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to
the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured
creditors; (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims; and (iv) for the payment of
deferred claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings
are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors including, inter alios, a claim whose priority is
legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing, mentioned above), the claims of
the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages.
The remaining priority claims are those of “privileged” creditors (creditori privilegiati; a
priority in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law),
mortgagees (creditori ipotecari), pledgees (creditori pignoratizi) and unsecured creditors
(crediti chirografari).

- Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back”
or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, _inter alios, to the revocation of_
payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of
judicial liquidation. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market
value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Clawback rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver
in judicial liquidation compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In judicial liquidation proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the New Italian Crisis and
Insolvency Law provides for a claw-back period of up to either two years, one year or six months
in certain circumstances (please note that in the context of extraordinary administration
procedures—see below—in relation to certain transactions, the claw-back period can be extended


-----

to five and three years, respectively) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other
transactions.

The New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are
ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the
receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below:

- Acts ineffective by operation of law.

(i) Under Article 163 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, subject to certain
limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-`avis creditors if entered into by the debtor entity in the two-year period prior to the
insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to
Article 163 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law becomes part of the judicial
liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of
judicial liquidation, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is
sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the
delegated judge for violation of law pursuant to Article 133 of the New Italian Crisis and
Insolvency Law; and

(ii) under Article 164 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, payments of receivables
falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective
vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the debtor within the two-year period prior to the
insolvency declaration.

- Acts that may be avoided at the receiver’s request.

(i) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below,
may be clawed back (revocati) vis-a-vis the judicial liquidation as provided for by article
166 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law and be declared ineffective, unless the
non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s
insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

‒ transactions for valuable consideration in which the obligations performed or
assumed by the debtor exceed by more than one-fourth the consideration received or
promised in return;

‒ payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in
cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the
insolvency declaration;

‒ pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor in the year prior to the insolvency
declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which not yet due at the time the new
security was granted; and

‒ pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor in the six months prior to the
insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen
due at the time the new security was granted.

(ii) The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such
other period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective
if the receiver proves that the other party knew that the debtor was insolvent at the
time of the act or transaction:

‒ the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous
transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency
declaration; and

‒ the granting of security interest for debts simultaneously incurred in the six


-----

months prior to the insolvency declaration.

(iii) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

‒ a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business
according to market practice;

‒ a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and
permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

‒ a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis the
Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential
property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s
family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended
as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the
insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments
for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

‒ transactions entered into, payments made and security interests granted with respect
to the bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a
_piano di risanamento attestato (see “—Out-of-Court Reorganization Plans (Piani di_
_Risanamento) Pursuant to Articles 56 or 284 of the New Italian Crisis and_
_Insolvency Law”);_

‒ a transaction entered into, payment made or security interest granted in execution of
a concordato preventivo (see “—Court Supervised Composition with Creditors
_(concordato preventivo)”) or an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti under Article_
64 bis of the Old Italian Bankruptcy Law (see “—Debt Restructuring Agreements
_with Creditors Pursuant to Article 64-bis of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency_
_Law (Accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)”);_

‒ remuneration payments to the debtor’s employees and consultants concerning work
carried out by them; and

‒ payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date,
with respect to services necessary for access to the crisis and insolvency
regulation instruments and insolvency proceedings.

In addition, in certain cases, under Article 164 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, the
receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor be declared without effect vis-`a-vis the
acting creditors within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria
_ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions_
through which the debtor disposed of its assets to the detriment of such creditor’s rights be
declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of
such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the creditor’s
claim originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor in order to cause
detriment of such creditor’s rights) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for
consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such detriment (or, if the
transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, such third
party participated in the fraudulent scheme). Burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a
“simplified” claw-back action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in
place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors.
In particular, the creditor can start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without
previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent)
transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g.


-----

gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called _fondo_
_patrimoniale, i.e., “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also_
be carried out by the creditor against the third party purchaser.

**_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (Amministrazione Straordinaria_**
**_Delle Grandi Imprese in Stato di Insolvenza)_**

An extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law for large industrial and
commercial enterprises (the “Prodi-bis procedure”). The relevant company must be insolvent, but
demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have
employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at
least two-thirds of its total assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income
from sales and services during its last financial year. Any of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the
public prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary administration procedure. The
same rules set forth for judicial liquidation proceedings with respect creditors’ claims largely apply
to extraordinary administration proceedings and, with respect to pending contracts, these shall
continue to be executed as long as the extraordinary commissioner does not exercise his right of
termination. There are two main phases: a “judicial phase” and an “administrative phase.”

- _Judicial Phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the_
admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints
a delegated judge (giudice delegato) or up to three judicial receivers (commissiario giudiziale)
to investigate whether the company has serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or
reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within ten
days from such filing, the Italian Ministry of Productive Activities may make an opinion on the
admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides
(within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or
to place it into judicial liquidation.

- _Administrative Phase. Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary_
administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner
(or commissioners) is appointed by the Italian Productive Activities Minister. The extraordinary
commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan which can provide for either the sale of the business as a
going concern within one year (unless extended by the Italian Ministry of Productive Activities)
(the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial
recovery within two years (unless extended by the Italian Ministry of Productive Activities) (the
“Recovery Plan”). The plan may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., a debt for
equity swap, an issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the company have been
transferred, etc.) (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Italian Ministry of Productive
Activities within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner.

In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial
condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Italian Ministry of Productive
Activities. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery
Plan, failing which the company is declared insolvent and subject to judicial liquidation.

**_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (Ristrutturazione Industriale di_**
**_Grandi Imprese in Stato di Insolvenza)_**

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted
into Italian Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the
“Marzano procedure.” It is complementary to the _Prodi-bis_ procedure and, except as otherwise
provided, the same provisions apply. The _Marzano_ procedure is intended to work faster than the
_Prodi-bis_ procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the
Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase.


-----

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis,
have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million
of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a _Marzano_
procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application
for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met
and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also
decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to
submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the
Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two
years. If no Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the
company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings.

Pursuant to Article 91 of the Prodi Bis (applicable only to Extraordinary Administration and Special
Extraordinary Administration) provides for a special form of insolvency claw-back action (so-called
_revocatoria fallimentare aggravata) in case of intragroup transaction, pursuant to which the suspect_
period increases from six months to three years and from one year to five years.

Under Italian Law, an intragroup transaction is a transaction made between two companies of the
same group. According to article 80 of the _Prodi Bis_ (applicable only to Extraordinary
Administration and Special Extraordinary Administration), a company is part of a group (impresa
_del gruppo) if (x) it controls directly or indirectly the company subject to the Extraordinary_
Administration; or (y) it is directly or indirectly controlled by the company subject to the
Extraordinary Administration or by the company that controls the latter; or (z) it is subject, due to
the composition of the administrative bodies or other elements, to a common direction to that of the
company subject to the Extraordinary Administration.

**_Compulsory Administrative Winding-Up (Liquidazione Coatta Amministrativa)_**

The compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is regulated under
Articles 293 and ff. of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law without substantial changes from
the provisions of the Old Italian Bankruptcy Law. This procedure is only available for public
interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and
other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to judicial liquidation
proceedings. This procedure may also be applied to cooperative companies, as an alternative to
judicial liquidation proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the
private sector. In line with the provisions of Article 1 paragraph 1, last sentence of the New Italian
Crisis and Insolvency law, compulsory administrative winding-up does not apply to public entities.
However, it should be clarified that companies with public shareholdings, which are considered in
the same way as other companies, should not be considered as such for the purposes of the New
Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law. Therefore, the subjective scope of application remains unchanged
from the Old Italian Bankruptcy Law regime and referred to the provision of individual special laws.

A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is
liquidated not by the insolvency court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the
industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of
the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions
(e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or
serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator
(commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are


-----

monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the
designated judge and the insolvency court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by
the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative
winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under judicial liquidation proceedings and includes,
for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for judicial liquidation
proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary
administration proceedings.

Please note that Article 295 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law reformulates Article 196
of the Old Italian Bankruptcy Law and confirms the general principle that companies subject to
compulsory administrative winding-up are not subject to judicial liquidation, unless otherwise
provided by special law. In any case, when even an entity is abstractly subject to either procedure,
the second paragraph of Article 295 specifies that the declaration of the opening of compulsory
administrative winding-up excludes the possibility of judicial liquidation and vice versa.

**_Hardening Period/Claw-back and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In an insolvency proceeding, the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law provides for a claw-back
period of up to one year (six-months in certain circumstances) (“revocatoria”). In addition, in
certain cases, the receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective
within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (“revocatoria ordinaria”).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into
insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the security documents and the
guarantee could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other
creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of
New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or
claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect
period”). The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of
one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset
or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by
the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted
with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation
of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the
debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six
months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable,
unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the
time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions
at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the
suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the receiver proves that the
creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. If the guarantee or the security interests created
under the security documents are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantee or
in connection with security interests may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be
refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any guarantee or security interest is
voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the guarantee or security interest and may not
be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents and guarantees.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 163 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law, subject
to certain limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration
are ineffective vis-`a-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the
insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 164 of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law,
payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are
ineffective vis-`a-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to
insolvency. In addition, as noted above, the EC Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which


-----

replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings
within the European Union.

**_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming,
especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the
enforcement process in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be
familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to
liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been
balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred
along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees
and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to
potential challenges by the appointed receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness
or avoidance or claw-back of the New Italian Crisis and Insolvency Law and the relevant law on the
non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect
period. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw-back
actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws”.

If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any
amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any
security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security
interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security
documents.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in
general may be subject to, inter alios, the following aspects:

- the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed above
relating to or affecting the rights of creditors;

- an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures,
the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Italian court;

- with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive),
each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not
offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code;

- claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of
Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e
_decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to_
counterclaim;

- pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for
the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary
obligation or fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable;

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a
matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that
such opinion is based on reasonable grounds;


-----

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law
may be limited by the fact that the relevant provisions of laws may be deemed contrary to Italian
public policy principles;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular
agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such
agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by
its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del
_diritto);_

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument
may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation
pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal,
invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in
order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the
interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties
following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil
Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest
for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for in
the Italian Civil Code are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether affiliated or unaffiliated with
such Italian company, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case
basis;

- in case of judicial liquidation, a receiver is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding
under the supervision of the insolvency court and creditors cannot start or continue individual
foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor
(automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such
receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the insolvency court;

- the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in
which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in judicial liquidation falls (or,
in the absence of seizure/ attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand
(precetto)) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the
extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant
foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such
assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an
undisputable date (data certa) the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly.
One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the
execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states
the date of witnessing on the document, another way is to have each page of the document
stamped by the post office;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning
advance waivers or forfeitures;


-----

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is
prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct
(dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions;

- penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

- Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation;

- a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor from continuing enforcement
or enforcement proceedings against the assets subject to the relevant pledge;

- in case of judicial liquidation of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets
subject to the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant judicial
liquidation proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior
satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would
lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/ shares; and

- any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain
Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, _inter alios, any obligation to pay: (i) any_
portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian Law
no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related
implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any
compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the
Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after
legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and
capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant
maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian
Banking Act)) may not be enforceable.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an
action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date on which the
latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its
assets, in order to seek a claw- back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901
of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of
the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting
_creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and_
other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following
findings:

- that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting
creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was
fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

- that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and,
if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party
participated in the fraudulent design.

Furthermore, under fraudulent conveyance and other provisions of Italian law, a court could void or
invalidate all or a portion of the obligations of a guarantor under the relevant guarantee and, if
payment had already been made under that guarantee, require the recipients of that payment to return
the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that, inter alios:

- the relevant guarantor gave such guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its
current or future creditors or with the intent of giving undue preference to certain creditors over


-----

others, or when the beneficiary of the guarantee was aware that the relevant guarantor was
insolvent when it gave the relevant guarantee;

- the relevant guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its
guarantee or the relevant guarantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was given;

- the relevant guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant guarantor or not
to be in the best interest or for the corporate benefit of the relevant guarantor; or

- the guarantor giving such guarantee was aware, or should have been aware, that the transaction
was to the detriment of the creditors.

If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee, or
held it unenforceable for any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any
claim with respect to the relevant guarantor. The same would also apply to any security interest.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Security Interests Under Italian Law_**

_Corporate Benefit and Financial Assistance Under Italian Law_

Under Italian law, the entry into of a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the
granting of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the
applicable laws and by its by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on
corporate benefit, corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a
security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group
reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance concerns may also arise.

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest)
must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being
provided by such company, so called “corporate benefit.” The principles on corporate benefit apply
equally to up-stream and down-stream guarantees and security interests granted by Italian
companies. The concept of real and adequate corporate benefit is not defined in the applicable
legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence
is purely a business judgment-based decision of the directors of the company and the statutory
auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant
company on a stand-alone basis, although under certain circumstances and subject to specific rules,
the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While
corporate benefit for a downstream security interest or guarantee (i.e., a security interest or guarantee
granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) can
usually be easily demonstrated, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security
interest or guarantee (i.e., security interest or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the
direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized
under the laws of Italy depends on a real and adequate corporate benefit acting as consideration for
the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proven that the
grantor may derive adequate benefit or advantage from the granting of such guarantee or security
interest. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security interest or
guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. In particular,
in the case of an up-stream or cross-stream guarantee or security interest for the financial obligations
of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access by the
relevant company to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while
transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian
courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is available as to whether and to what extent such
transactions could be challenged for lack of real and adequate corporate benefit and conflict of
interest. As a general rule, the absence of a real and adequate corporate benefit could render the
transaction (including the granting of a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian
company as ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate


-----

resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and
annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that
it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out does not fall within the
corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of
corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons
ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or
profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or
guarantee granted by an Italian company) could, according to certain interpretations, be declared null
and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and
such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of a guarantee or a security interest may be considered as a
restricted financial activity (within the meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Banking Act), which
only banks and authorized financial intermediaries are qualified to carry out. Non-compliance with
the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees and
security interests being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of
April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, Paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the
issuance of a guarantee or security interest by a company for the obligations of another company
which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group”
includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil
Code as well as companies, which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the rules
described above, subject to the company and the guaranteed entity being members of the same
group, the provision of the guarantees and security interests would not amount to a restricted
financial activity.

_Financial Assistance_

In addition, a security interest or a guarantee by an Italian company may not be granted in support of
any liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358
or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific
exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans,
security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its
own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company.
Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription
of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation
of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of
these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in
the best interests of the company.

_Maximum Guaranteed Amount_

Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by a company incorporated
under the laws of Italy (each an “Italian Guarantor”) is issued to guarantee conditional or future
obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be
expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by
reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the
guarantees granted by an Italian Guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words,
the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the
financial capabilities of the relevant Italian Guarantors. It has been held, that such determination
must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed
disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee
could be declared void. It is uncertain, however, whether courts are entitled to debate and to rule
over such determinations.

In order to comply with applicable Italian law requirements on, _inter alios, corporate benefit and_


-----

financial assistance, the maximum amount that any Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in
respect of its obligations as Guarantor will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, an
Italian Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee may be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Notes, or an Italian Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its
Guarantee. Therefore, the limitation language for any Italian Guarantor to be included into the
relevant Notes documents, in particular in the Indenture, will substantially be in the form as follows:

- the restrictions in the guarantee clause of the Indenture shall apply to any guarantee, indemnity,
liability and other payment obligations under the Indenture and/or any other documents
(including, without limitation, any security document granted by an Italian Guarantor) to secure
liabilities of any obligor arising under the Notes documents, which in any case shall not exceed
the difference between:

(i) the maximum aggregate amount of any intercompany loan or other financial support in
any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity contributions) made
available at any time to that Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries
pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian civil code) after the date of becoming an obligor,
and is outstanding as at the date of the event which triggered the enforceability of the
guarantee granted by that Italian Guarantor; and

(ii) the aggregate amount that, at the time of the enforcement of the guarantee provided for
under the Indenture (each an “Italian Security Interest”), such Italian Guarantor has
already been required to pay or has actually paid as a result of an enforcement of any
Italian Security Interest granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor;

- notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes documents, any guarantee,
indemnity, obligations (including, without limitation, any security obligations) and liability
granted or assumed pursuant to the Notes by an Italian Guarantor shall not include and shall not
extend, directly or indirectly, to any amount lent (or intended to be used) to acquire or subscribe,
directly or indirectly, shares or quotas in such Italian Guarantor or any direct or indirect
controlling entity of such Italian Guarantor (or to refinance any indebtedness incurred for such
purposes) or to any obligations incurred by any other guarantor under any guarantee given by
such other guarantor for the same purposes, so as to exclude any case of undue financial
assistance pursuant to article 2358 and/or 2474 of the Italian civil code;

- notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes documents, each Italian Guarantor
shall be entitled to set-off its obligations relating to a loan and/or financial support received by
any other obligor against the claims of recourse or subrogation (“regresso” or “surrogazione”)
against that obligor arising as a result of any payment of the obligations of that obligor made by
such Italian Guarantor under the guarantee clause of the Indenture as a result of the enforcement
of any Italian Security Interests;

- without prejudice to paragraph (a) above, pursuant to article 1938 of the Italian civil code, the
maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay under the Indenture shall not
exceed the maximum guaranteed amount.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed
amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the
Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders
of the Notes may be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its
obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security
documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will
rateably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor to


-----

any guaranteed and/or secured creditor and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the
avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and
the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as
guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall
be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate
amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/ or security
obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the maximum
amount of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

_Trust and parallel debt_

Under Italian law the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in
the relevant security document. Due to the impossibility to clearly identify and keep track over
time of the names of the individual holder of the Notes, the Italian security will be created in
favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes and in favor of the Security Agent as
representative of all secured creditors. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether,
under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as
the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or
are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents
or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust”
or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights
and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain
under Italian law.

Given the above and considering that the holders of the Notes are not party to the Italian law
governed security documents, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of
the Notes (in relation to which the relevant perfection formalities acknowledging their status as a
secured creditor are not perfected at the time of enforcement) are not secured by the security
interests created under the Italian law governed security documents and/or cannot enforce that
security interest.

To address the above potential issue, the collateral securing the Notes will be granted and
perfected in favor of the Trustee and in favor of Security Agent acting also in its capacity as legal
representative (mandatario con rappresentanza) of the holders of the Notes.

In bond issuances made by Italian joint stock companies (società per azioni), pursuant to Article
2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11,
2014), security interests can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the
holders of the Notes who will then be authorized to enforce them on behalf of the holders of the
Notes. The security governed by Italian law will be created and perfected in favor of the Trustee
and in favor of Security Agent acting also as rappresentante of the holders of the Notes in
accordance with such Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code to the extent
applicable. However, there is no guidance or available interpretation on how such a new provision
may be applied to security created to secure bond issuances made by a non-Italian entity.

The Indenture might also provide for the creation of a “parallel debt”. Pursuant to the parallel debt
claim and subject to the terms of the Indenture and to applicable law, the Security Agent, in its
individual capacity acting in its own name and not as agent or representative of the holders of the
Notes, shall become the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the
Notes. However, parallel debt structures included in the Indenture, according to which the
security interest is also granted in favor of the Security Agent, as beneficiary of parallel debt
obligations against the Issuer, which will be discharged to the extent the corresponding principal
payment obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes are discharged, have not been


-----

tested under Italian law and there can be no assurance that they will eliminate or mitigate the risk
of unenforceability under Italian laws.

_Certain Considerations in Relation to Security Interests_

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules
to protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect
thereof. In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or
indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that
borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the
same person or (iii) a quota holder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a _società_ a
_responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior_
only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of
business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness
compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection
of equity and not a loan. Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within
one year prior to a judicial liquidation declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower.
The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude
that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support
provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized
above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to
companies incorporated as _società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the_
intercompany loans that are a società per azioni.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian
courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian
subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans, if any. Accordingly, an Italian court may
conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are
subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any
subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to
other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to
recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which
could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the
Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany
loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover
under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees granted by
such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

_Risks Related to Pledges Over Bank Accounts_

The enforceability and perfection of a pledge over bank accounts would be subject to the service on
the relevant account bank of a notice bearing a date certain at law (data certa) or obtainment of an
acceptance bearing a date certain at law (data certa) from the relevant account bank each time the
balance of the accounts changes and, based on a certain line of interpretation, there is a risk that the
pledge purported to be created over each increase in the balance of the relevant account may not
exist until the above formalities are carried out and that such pledge be considered a new and
different pledge to all intents and purposes. Therefore, the holders of the Notes would lose the
benefit of the relevant security interest in case of failure to take the actions required to re-perfect the
security interest and, however, a new hardening period would start to run from the date on which the
relevant perfection formalities are repeated.


-----

_Risks Related to Pledges Granted Pursuant to the Italian Decree 170/2004_

The Italian security documents may contain an express reference to Legislative Decree No. 170 of
21 May 2004 as amended by Legislative Decree No. 48 of 24 March 2011 (“Decree 170”), which
implemented in Italy Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 June
2002 on financial collateral arrangements. Decree 170 is applicable, _inter alios, to the extent that_
parties to collateral arrangements fall under certain categories listed therein. Should the relevant
parties to the Italian security documents do not fall under any of the categories provided under
Decree 170, the relevant provisions of Decree 170 would not apply to the pledges purported to be
created under the relevant Italian security documents. In addition, in the absence of court precedents
on the point, it might be disputable whether the shares represented by shares certificates pledged
under an Italian security document by qualify as eligible financial instruments (strumenti finanziari)
for the purposes of Decree 170, considering that although company shares are expressly listed by
way of example in the definition of financial instruments (more specifically, in the definition of
movable assets (valori mobiliari) which is a category of financial instruments) provided under article
1 bis of Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998 (and adopted by way of express reference by
Decree 170), the financial instruments generally (including the shares companies) are required to be
categories of securities negotiable in the capital markets (categorie di valori che possono essere
_negoziati sul mercato dei capitali). Should the relevant requirement be construed as the potential_
ability for shares to be traded on capital markets, the shares pledged by the relevant Italian security
document would fall within the definition of financial instruments adopted by Decree 170 and, as
such, would be eligible for the purpose of application of Decree 170; should, on the contrary, the
relevant requirement be construed as the actual ability for shares to be traded on capital markets, the
shares pledged by the relevant Italian security document, which are not listed on a regulated market
or traded on another capital market, would not be eligible for the purpose of application of Decree
170.

**Spain**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Spain and of the
limitations applicable to the guarantees provided by the Guarantor.

**_Spanish Insolvency Act_**

Law 16/2022, of 5 September (Ley 16/2002, de 5 de septiembre, de reforma del texto refundido de la
_Ley Concursal) amends Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020 of 5 May (as amended from time to time,_
the “Spanish Insolvency Act”), which was enacted to restate and improve the previous legal
framework governing insolvency in Spain, with the aim of implementing the restructuring
framework required by Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and
on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and
discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and
insolvency), as well as otherwise significantly amending the previous insolvency law. The
amendments to the Spanish Insolvency Act came into force, subject to certain exceptions, on 26
September 2022.

The Spanish Insolvency Act regulates insolvency proceedings (which are court-supervised), as
opposed to out-of-court liquidation (which, pursuant to Spanish corporate law, is only available when
the debtor has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities or in specific situations regulated under the
Spanish Insolvency Act). The Spanish full-blown insolvency proceeding (bankruptcy), which is
referred to as “concurso de acreedores”, applies to all persons or entities (save for limited exceptions
specifically contemplated in the Spanish Insolvency Act). These proceedings may lead either to
reorganization through the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor
(convenio) (the “Composition Agreement”) or to the liquidation of the debtor’s assets.

_Insolvency Filing_


-----

A debtor (in the case of a company, its directors) is required to file the bankruptcy petition within
two months upon inability to regularly pay its liabilities as they become due (insolvencia actual). As
a general rule, a debtor had to file for voluntary insolvency within two months from the date on
which it knew, or should have known, that it was in an insolvency situation. The debtor is also
entitled (but not required) to apply for such insolvency proceedings when it foresees its inability to
regularly pay liabilities as they become due in the next three months (insolvencia inminente).
According to the amendments to the Spanish Insolvency Act, a debtor is in an imminent insolvency
scenario when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they will become due in the next
three months. Creditors do also have standing to petition mandatory bankruptcy (concurso necesario)
when the debtor is unable to regularly pay its debts as they come due (i.e., an actual insolvency
scenario).

Bankruptcy is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. If the debtor
requests the bankruptcy, it must prove its current or imminent insolvency. The debtor must file a
petition for bankruptcy within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of
its state of actual insolvency (inability to regularly pay the debts as they come due). It is presumed
that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proven, if any of the circumstances
that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Where the debtor fails to file
a petition for bankruptcy within the time period established by law (two months), (i) the directors
may be removed from office and substituted by a bankruptcy authority once the bankruptcy is
declared and the bankruptcy process is initiated; (ii) the debtor may be unable to exercise certain
courses of action (including, _inter alios, the possibility of submitting a pre-arranged settlement_
proposal); and (iii) the directors may be held liable for the impaired claims accrued as from the
consent of insolvency (responsabilidad concursal), should the debtor be liquidated and bankruptcy
be deemed as “guilty” (concurso culpable).

Bankruptcy is considered mandatory (concurso necesario) if filed by a third-party and upheld by the
court. Under Article 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration of
insolvency if it can prove that the debtor has failed to attach or seize any assets, or sufficient assets,
to pay the amount owed. A creditor may also apply for a debtor’s insolvency if it can prove to the
court (i) a previous insolvency declaration of the debtor by a non-appealable judicial or
administrative resolution, (ii) a generalized default on payments by the debtor, (iii) a seizure of
assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets, (iv) a misplacement, “fire sale”,
hasty, loss-making or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets or (v) a generalized default on certain
tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (i.e. three
months).

The general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two months does not apply if, by means of
the communication that is foreseen under Article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Act (the so-called 5
_bis_ communication by reference to a previous regulation –Law 22/2003–), the debtor who is in
actual, imminent or likely insolvency and has not been declared in insolvency notifies the court that
it has started negotiations with its creditors to seek support for a “restructuring plan” (the “Plan”), in
which case it will have an additional grace period of three months and one more to file for
insolvency. Such grace period of three months could be extended if, not later than at the end of the
initial three-month grace period, either creditors holding more than 50% of the debts that the Plan
may affect at that time (net of any credits that would qualify as subordinated claims in an insolvency
situation) or the debtor, with the support of such creditors, may request the court for a three-month
extension, provided the restructuring expert, if one is appointed, issues a favorable report in support
of the request. The court may lift the grace period extension at the request of the debtor, the
restructuring expert or creditors holding more than 40% of the debt that the Plan may affect at that
time (net of any credits that would qualify as subordinated claims in an insolvency situation), or any
creditor that proves that such extension no longer fulfils the objective of supporting the Plan
negotiations. Any creditor may also ask to be excluded from the effects of the grace period extension
if it could be unfairly prejudiced by it, and particularly if it could lead to its current insolvency or a
significant loss of the value of its collateral.


-----

The new law introduces the concept of “likelihood of insolvency” (probabilidad de insolvencia),
which is when it is objectively foreseeable that the debtor will be unable to regularly fulfil its
obligations that fall due in the next two years unless it enters into a Plan with its creditors. In
addition to being able to start negotiating with its creditors with a view to entering into a Plan at any
time during this period when insolvency is likely, the debtor will also be able to file for preinsolvency in court, in which case it will inform the court that it is trying to negotiate a Plan with its
creditors.

_Pre-Insolvency Filing_

Spanish law contains a restructuring moratorium proceeding, which is an insolvency proceeding
under both Spanish and European regulations. It protects the debtor, for a four-months period (or up
to seven months, if extended), from petitions for involuntary cases.

As mentioned above, the general duty to file for bankruptcy within the referred two-months period
does not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable Court that it has initiated negotiations with its
creditors to obtain support for a Plan, as set out in Articles 614 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act.
Effectively, by means of the pre-insolvency filing, on the top of those two months, the debtor gains
an additional three-months period (or up to six months, if extended) as from the date when the debtor
gives such notice, to achieve a Plan with its creditors and one further month to file for bankruptcy, if
after the above mentioned period of three months (or of six months if extended) has elapsed without
an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists.

Additionally, during the three-month protection period provided for by the pre-insolvency filing (or
six months in case it has been extended under the new insolvency regime), enforcement actions are
stayed, subject to multiple rules. As a general rule, neither judicial nor extrajudicial enforcement
proceedings may be initiated to seize or attach assets or rights that the debtor requires to continue its
professional or business activities (the so-called “necessary assets”). Previously initiated
enforcement proceedings will be stayed. It is not always easy to determine when an asset is
necessary to operate the business and, for this reason, this issue needs to be decided by courts on a
case-by-case basis. They normally take a flexible approach and consider elements such as cash or
credit rights as assets that are necessary to continue to run the business. However, creditors may
challenge the court clerk’s asset qualification, which the court will hear.

At the debtor’s request, the court may impose these stays to one or several creditors or classes of
creditors in respect of other assets or rights, even if they are not deemed “necessary assets”, if doing
so could help bring the negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion, provided the restructuring expert, if
one has been appointed, has given its consent. The court decision on this suspension may be
challenged by a remedy (recurso de reposición), exclusively. Subject to the above, enforcing
security in rem over “necessary assets” may be initiated but will be automatically stayed. However,
neither financial collateral governed by RDL 5/2005, nor in rem security interests over assets located
in another Member State (other than Denmark) should be affected by this suspension.

In relation to the above provisions, Spanish courts may apply them in relation to assets held by nonSpanish affiliates of the entity that files for pre-insolvency, with effects outside of Spain. In any
case, the above regime does not apply to public credit rights (créditos de derecho público). In such
case, enforcement can be suspended in very limited circumstances and, in any case, up to a
maximum period of three months.

Likewise, creditors that cannot be subject to the effects of a Plan cannot be affected by the preinsolvency filing. Furthermore, while the effects of pre-insolvency are in force, according to the
amended Spanish Insolvency Act, directors’ legal duty to wind up the company in the event of a
capital impairment situation (i.e., its net equity is below a half of its share capital) is suspended. In
case of essential contracts for the viability of the business, the relevant counterparties will not be
entitled to suspend, amend or early terminate such contract for contractual breaches occurred prior to
the pre-insolvency filing while the effects of such communication are in force (even if the relevant


-----

contracts allowed it).

Pre-insolvency filings also have the following effects:

 - _Over credit rights. Pre-insolvency does not cause itself the early maturity of claims._
Contractual provisions amending or declaring the early maturity of claims in case of preinsolvency shall become ineffective.

 - _Over contracts. Any contractual provisions declaring the early termination, suspension or_
amendment of a contract in case of pre-insolvency or analogous proceedings shall be
rendered ineffective. This will not be applicable for contractual netting agreements
(acuerdos de compensación contractual) subject to RDL 5/2005.

_Restructuring Plan_

Under the amended Spanish Insolvency Act, the effects of a Plan can be imposed on all types of
creditors and claims (subject to specific and limited exceptions), including trade creditors, one or
multiple classes of creditors and, with certain exceptions, even debtor’s shareholders. Public
creditors can only be subject to the Plan if very strict requirements are complied with. In particular,
claims held by public creditors (e.g., tax authorities, and the Social Security) cannot be subject to a
haircut, debt- for-equity swap, change of debtor or change of governing law. According to this
special regime, as a general rule, their maturity can be extended up to twelve months since the
issuance of the homologation ruling and up to six months since the issuance of the homologation
ruling if a deferral or division in instalments (aplazamiento o fraccionamiento de pago) of such debt
has been agreed with the public administration.

The Plan must include a minimum content set out in Article 633 of the Spanish Insolvency Act and
will need to be formalized in a public document (formalizado en instrumento público).

An important change introduced in the context of the implementation of Directive 2019/1023 is that
the court may now suspend a debtor’s voluntary application for insolvency during the pre-insolvency
period at the request of either the restructuring expert, or creditors holding more than 50% of the debt
affected by the Plan, if the court receives evidence that a creditor-supported Plan has been prepared
that could be approved. This rule may therefore prevent debtors from frustrating ongoing refinancing
negotiations by filing for insolvency, thus allowing viable Plans to be accomplished, as long as the
creditors submit the Plan for the court’s approval within a month following the debtor’s petition for
voluntary insolvency (Article 612 of the Spanish Insolvency Act).

In addition, as opposed to the previous Spanish insolvency act, which only allowed a closed-ended
list of measures to be imposed on dissenting creditors, a Plan under the Spanish Insolvency Act may
contain almost any restructuring alternative, provided it is sufficient and proportionate to ensure the
viability of the business and its continuation as a going concern. The debtor and its creditors may
agree on any type of measure deemed necessary to effectively restructure the debtor’s business,
including changes in the composition, conditions or structure –not only of the debtor’s liabilities, but
also of its assets or any part of its capital structure. This could include sales of assets, parts of the
business or even the entire business as a going concern, as well as any other necessary operational
changes, or a combination of the same. The Plan must nevertheless set out the reasons why it has a
“reasonable prospect of preventing the insolvency” of the debtor and ensuring the viability of its
business, including the necessary pre- conditions for its success.

In addition, the mere judicial approval of a Plan does not affect bilateral contracts with outstanding
reciprocal obligations at that time, they remain in force. Moreover, contracts that are deemed
necessary to ensure the continuity of the debtor’s business cannot be terminated due to a change of
control in the debtor as a result of a debt-for-equity swap contemplated by the Plan. However, the
Spanish Insolvency Act specifies certain exceptions to the principle of continuation of bilateral


-----

contracts that aim to ensure a Plan’s success, in particular, in relation to: (i) executory contracts (i.e.,
contracts with outstanding bilateral obligations); (ii) contracts with senior executives; (iii) financial
collateral arrangements, netting arrangements; and (iv) trade supply agreements.

On a separate note, class formation has been introduced by the amended Spanish Insolvency Act.
Creditors affected by the Plan will be grouped into classes. The class formation criteria must be
based on a common interest shared by each group of creditors. As a general rule, it is presumed that
creditors with the same ranking in an insolvency process share a common interest, but they can also
be separated into different classes if there are reasons justifying such split (e.g., financial and nonfinancial nature, conflicts of interests among creditors of different classes, measures to be imposed
by the Plan). In any case, secured claims must constitute a single class, unless the different nature of
the collateral justifies the creation of separate classes. Claims governed by public law will also
constitute a separate class among the classes with the same ranking.

**_Enforcement and Termination in a Pre-Insolvency Scenario_**

The obligations under the Guarantees might not necessarily be enforced in accordance with their
respective terms in every circumstance, such enforcement being subject to, inter alios, the nature of
the remedies available in the Spanish Courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the
discretion of the courts, the power of such courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the Spanish
Law on Civil Procedure (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamiento Civil) regarding remedies and
enforcement measures available under Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Act and
other principles of law of general application.

Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity nor the concept of punitive
damages. In principle, the legal remedy which will be awarded under Spanish law is compensation
for damages (indemnización de daños). Section 1,152 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that any
penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties in an agreement will substitute damages
(indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an event of breach,
unless otherwise agreed. Spanish Courts may modify the penalty agreed on an equitable basis if the
debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, unless the penalty (liquidated damages)
was aimed at such partial performance (and in any event if it is deemed to be disproportionate
according to the good faith principle). There is doubt as to the enforceability in Spain of punitive
damages. Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be
enforceable in Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the applicable
jurisdiction.

Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the
discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and
enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting
parties.

Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court, precludes an agreement being terminated on
the basis of a breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or
complementary to the main undertakings foreseen under the relevant agreement (such as payment
obligations under financing agreements), and allows Spanish courts not to enforce any such
termination. Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision
whenever said acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed to have
been executed in circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose application was
intended to be avoided shall apply.

A Spanish Court may award damages if the specific performance of an obligation is deemed
impracticable. A Spanish Court may modify the obligations deriving from contracts in the terms
considered necessary in order to restore the balance between the obligations, if unexpected and
exceptional circumstances arise that were unforeseeable when the contracts were executed, which


-----

would have been expressly or implicitly assumed.

**_Effects of Bankruptcy Declaration_**

_Effects for the Debtor_

As a general rule, the debtor in a voluntary case retains its management power, but is subject to the
intervention (intervención) of the insolvency administrator (administrador concursal), who is
appointed by the court. In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s
management will be replaced (sustitución) by the insolvency administrator. However, the court has
the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific circumstances of the case. In addition,
upon the insolvency administrator’s request, the court has the power to swap the intervention regime
for a suspension regime or vice versa. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required
supervision of the bankruptcy authorities may be declared null and void.

The referred limitations on the management’s powers also affect the representation powers under
powers of attorney granted by the company. This may affect, for instance, irrevocable powers of
attorney granted by the debtor in favor of a security agent or lenders in relation to any security granted,
which may not be unilaterally enforceable if the debtor is declared insolvent given that the exercise
of the powers conferred therein may require the insolvency administrator’s approval. The time
between the petition and the insolvency declaration by the court will depend upon a number of
factors, including whether the filing has been made by the debtor or the creditor (and in turn whether
the debtor has challenged the petition made by the creditor), whether all appropriate documentation
has been submitted on a timely basis or is incomplete, and the workload of the court.

_Effects on Contracts_

Bankruptcy declaration does not affect contracts with reciprocal obligations pending performance by
both parties by bankruptcy declaration (executory contracts), which remain in full force and effect,
and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate. Earlytermination, suspension or amendment clauses triggered solely by the declaration of insolvency or
the liquidation are deemed void and unenforceable, except when such provisions are legally
permitted (e.g. swap agreements or agency agreements).

The debtor or the insolvency administrator, with the court’s approval, may request the termination of
executory contracts in the interest of the insolvency estate (interés del concurso), including in the
absence of contractual grounds for termination. A hearing with the parties will be held at which they
will have the opportunity to reach an agreement on the termination and its effects. If an agreement is
not reached, formal court proceedings will be held that will result in a decision issued by the court.
The indemnity granted to the contractual counterparty as a result of a contract being terminated early
will be an insolvency claim (crédito concursal), and no longer a claim against the estate (crédito
_contra la masa)._

As a general rule, it is not possible to terminate an executory contract for breaches that occurred
before the declaration of the insolvency proceedings. However, if a material breach of the executory
contract occurred after the declaration of insolvency, the non-defaulting party may request the
termination of the contract by filing a termination claim with the court. As an exception to the above,
termination due to pre-existing breaches may be admitted if the executory contract is a continuingperformance contract (tracto sucesivo). A continuing performance contract is characterized by the
long trade relationship that the parties enter into with each other, i.e. it does not require a one-off
performance, but rather successive or continuous performance over an agreed period (for instance,
leases or supply agreements). Some case law and legal scholars take nonetheless the position that
termination of the contract should not be possible if one party already complied with all its
contractual obligations prior to the declaration of insolvency.

When the default took place before the declaration of insolvency (when allowed), the claims of the


-----

non- defaulting party (including indemnity claims) will be an insolvency claim (crédito concursal).
On the contrary, claims arising from defaults which took place after the declaration of insolvency will
be claims against the estate (crédito contra la masa). Termination of the contract will also extinguish
the outstanding contractual obligations.

The court may disregard the breach – regardless of whether it occurred before or after the declaration
of insolvency –, and order specific performance of the contract for the remaining contractual term, if
the continuation of the agreement is deemed to be beneficial for the outcome of the insolvency
proceedings and it is requested by the debtor or the insolvency administrator. The court order may be
appealed. If the default took place after the declaration of insolvency, the amounts owed to nondefaulting parties arising from the agreement must be paid from the debtor’s insolvency estate within
three months after the court order. If such payment is breached, the contract may be terminated.

To ensure that the debtor’s estate has sufficient financial resources to continue the business, the
Spanish Insolvency Act allows the insolvency administrator, either unilaterally or at the debtor’s
request, to reinstate (rehabilitación) credit and other facility agreements to which the debtor was a
party and which were accelerated by the creditor as a result of a payment default (principal or
interest) in the three months preceding the declaration of insolvency. The exercise of this power by
the insolvency administrator is subject to three conditions:

- the insolvency administrator must provide notice of the reinstatement to the creditor before
expiry of the term to lodge claims (that is, as a general rule, one month as from publication of
the declaration of insolvency);

- the insolvency administrator must satisfy or deposit any amounts unpaid at the time of
reinstatement and “assume” future payments against the insolvency estate; and

- the creditor must not have opposed the reinstatement or started any actions to claim payment
before the insolvency proceedings commenced.

A similar reinstatement rule exists in relation to deferred-payment purchase agreements that are
terminated early within the three months preceding the declaration of insolvency. Additionally,
bankruptcy declaration suspends interest accrual, except for claims secured with an in rem right, in
which case interest accrues up to the value of the security, and except for any wage credits in favor of
employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding Law of the State
Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado).

In any event, set-off is prohibited once the debtor has been declared insolvent unless (i) the
requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the declaration of insolvency, even if such
compensation is alleged afterwards, or the creditor communicated the existence of the claim to the
insolvency administrator; (ii) the claim of the insolvent debtor is governed by a foreign law that
permits set-off; or (iii) the claims and debts arise from the same legal relation. As a general rule,
bankruptcy declaration stays, up to a year, enforcement proceedings tied to collateral necessary to
pursue the ordinary course (excluding financial collateral, as defined in Royal Decree Law 5/2005,
which can be enforced as any time, and where the collateral is located outside of Spain).

The enforcement of any security over certain assets that are necessary to the continuation of the
commercial or professional activity of the insolvent company (in rem securities) is prohibited until
the earlier of (i) an arrangement of a composition agreement being reached, provided that the
Composition Agreement does not affect such right, (ii) one year having elapsed as of the declaration of
the insolvency without the opening of the liquidation phase or (iii) the judge conducting the
insolvency proceedings declaring that the asset is not necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s
activities in accordance with the Spanish Insolvency Act. Commencement of the liquidation phase
causes the loss of the right to commence a separate enforcement process (derecho de ejecución
_separada) in relation to those secured lenders who did not commence enforcement either before the_
declaration of insolvency or after a year since the declaration of insolvency. Secured lenders will


-----

receive back the enforcement right after one year since liquidation is initiated in case the relevant
good or right has not been sold.

Nevertheless, shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the
holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of
that asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the
foreclosure of the relevant security interest that has been granted over such shares does not bring
about an early termination or amendment of the contractual relations permitting the economic
exploitation of the relevant asset.

_Ranking of Credits_

The judge’s insolvency order contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to them
within a one-month period following the last official publication in the Official State Gazette
(Boletín Oficial del Estado) of the court order declaring the insolvency (proof of claims), by
providing original documentation that justifies their claims. Based on such documentation provided
by the creditors and held by the debtor, the insolvency administrator draws up a list of acknowledged
claims and classifies them according to the categories established under law, which are as follows:
(i) claims against the insolvency estate, (ii) claims benefiting from special privileges, (iii) claims
benefiting from general privileges, (iv) ordinary claims and (v) subordinated claims.

Claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa) from Article 242 of the Spanish
Insolvency Act sets out the so-called “estate claims” which are pre-deductible claims from the estate
(excluding those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to _in rem_ security), are generally payable
when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before other claims). Debt against
the insolvency estate includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) certain
costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) amounts due by the debtor in reciprocal
agreements that are in force after the insolvency declaration and amounts due for breaches of those
agreements after the insolvency declaration; (iv) certain amounts arising from obligations created by
law or from tort liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its
conclusion, (v) certain debts in the ordinary course of business incurred by the debtor following the
declaration of insolvency; (vi) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor to comply
with a Composition Agreement prior to the opening of the liquidation phase; and (vii) 50% of the
new funds lent under a Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 635
_et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act, as long as the claims affected by the approved Plan amount to_
51% of the total liabilities at least. This classification shall not apply to the new funds lent by the
debtor or persons being in a special relationship with the debtor resulting from a share capital
increase, loans or acts with analogous purpose.

Claims benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (essentially in rem
security). Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain assets (in
_rem securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided that such security is listed in_
the creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security for purposes of the Composition Agreement
or a Plan shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset determined in accordance with
the rules provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Act minus senior claims). The part of the claim
exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the nature of the claim. Claims
secured with pledges over future credit rights are only considered specially privileged if (i) the future
credit rights arise from agreements or relationships established or executed prior to the declaration of
insolvency; and (ii) (a) in the case of possessory pledges, the pledge was granted as a public
document or, (b) in the case of non-possessory pledges (prenda sin desplazamiento), the pledge was
registered with the applicable public registry.

These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate proceedings, though subject to
certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year from the declaration of
the insolvency and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Act. However,
within such waiting period or while any enforcement proceedings remain suspended under the


-----

Spanish Insolvency Act, the insolvency administrator has the option to pay the relevant claims
against the insolvency estate under specific payment rules. Privileged creditors are not subject to
Composition Agreement, unless they give their express support by voting in favor of the
Composition Agreement or, in case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding
security which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the Composition
Agreement) of the total value of secured claims of the same class vote in favor of such Composition
Agreement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the secured assets
on which they are secured.

Claims benefiting from general privileges include, among others, certain labor debts and certain
debts with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations corresponding to tax debts
and social security obligations and debts held by the creditor applying for the corresponding
insolvency proceedings, to the extent such application has been approved, are recognized as
privileged for up to 50% of the amount of such debts. New funds under a Plan entered into in
compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act in
the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (crédito contra la masa) will also be
credits with general privileges. The holders of general privileges are not to be affected by the
restructuring (under a Composition Agreement) except if they give their express support by voting in
favor of the Composition Agreement or, in the case they do not give such express support, if
creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75%
depending on the conditions of the Composition Agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting
from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of such Composition Agreement. If they do
not agree to the arrangement and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment (in
the order established by law).

Ordinary claims (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) will be paid on a pro-rated basis from
the proceeds of the assets not subject to secured claims, former pre-deduction of estate claims and
generally privileged claims.

Subordinated claims are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts subordinated by
virtue of law include, among others, some credits held by parties in special relationships with the
debtor (personas especialmente relacionadas). In the case of individuals, this includes their relatives,
legal entities controlled by the debtor or its relatives, the factual or legal administrators of such legal
entities, any other legal entity forming part of the same group of companies and the legal entities in
respect of which the people described in this paragraph are their factual and legal administrators. In
the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed as “specially related parties”: (i) shareholders
with unlimited liability (in case such shareholders are natural persons it would include any specially
related party to these shareholders, as described herein), (ii) limited liability shareholders holding,
directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company
has securities listed on a regulated market)—when the shareholder is an individual, those who would
be specially related to the individual are also specially related to the debtor, or (iii) directors (either de
_jure_ or _de facto), liquidators and those holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent_
company (including those people that have held those positions during the two years prior to the
insolvency declaration) and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their
common shareholders provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set
forth in (ii) above. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized
their credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant to a Plan entered into in compliance with
the requirements set forth in Article 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act shall not be considered
as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of
the financing granted under such Plan. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary,
assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are
presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken
place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open.

Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors: they do not vote on the Composition Agreement
(and “specially related parties”, are not entitled to vote on a Plan) and in the event of liquidation, they


-----

collect payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Act (once ordinary
creditors have been paid in full).

_Hardening Periods_

There is no automatic claw-back by virtue of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that
automatically become void as a result of initiation of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency
administrator may only challenge those transactions that could be deemed as being “detrimental” to
the insolvent debtor’s estate (masa activa), provided that they have taken place within two years
prior to bankruptcy declaration, even in the absence of fraudulent intent.

The same rescission grounds apply in relation to any detrimental action carried out or agreement
entered into by the debtor within two years preceding the pre-insolvency filing, as well as those
carried out since that date up to the declaration of insolvency, even if there has been no fraudulent
intent, as long as: (i) the Plan has not been passed or, when passed, has not been approved by the
court; and (ii) the insolvency is declared within a year of the end of the pre-insolvency period.

“Detriment” does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction
on the debtor’s interests or on the equality of treatment among creditors. The analysis of whether an
action, agreement or transaction is detrimental to the insolvency estate must be made on a case-bycase basis. The Spanish Insolvency Act does not define “detrimental” but it establishes a series of
presumptions that give some indication as to how a court would rule in specific cases. Pursuant to
the law, (a) detriment exists (as a non-rebuttable presumption, without admission of proof to the
contrary) in the case of (i) disposals without consideration, except for ordinary largesse
(liberalidades de uso) and early payment of unsecured obligations maturing after the insolvency
declaration (except secured claims); and (b) detriment is deemed to exist (as a rebuttable
presumption) in the case of (i) transactions entered into with parties that have a special relationship
with the debtor, (ii) the creation of in rem rights in order to secure pre-existing obligations or those
incurred to replace existing obligations and (iii) the cancellation of obligations secured by an in rem
security falling due after the declaration of insolvency. In the remaining cases, detriment would have
to be evidenced by the party seeking rescission.

Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third-party, to secure
other group companies’ debt may be subject to claw-back, on the basis that such guarantees or
security interests may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the Guarantor is not
able to show that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the Guarantor to grant
such guarantee or security (beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the
same group of companies or the so-called “group interest”). Whether or not the granting of any
upstream guarantee or security by the Guarantor is detrimental to the guarantor’s estate is a factual
matter that will need to be proven on a case by case basis (the beneficiary of the guarantee bearing
the burden of such proof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spanish case law recognizes the validity
of upstream guarantees.

If a claw-back action is successful, restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction,
together with the proceeds and interest, will be ordered by the judge. If the assets cannot be restored
to the debtor, the counterparty to the insolvent debtor must pay an amount in cash equal to the value
of the assets at the time of their disposal, plus interest. If the judge rules that the transaction has been
conducted in bad faith, the liable party will be required to indemnify the debtor for the losses
suffered as its claim will be classified as subordinated. If the judge does not conclude that the
transaction was conducted in bad faith, the counterparty to the debtor will settle its credit
simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and rights to the insolvency estate as per bilateral
contracts.

The exercise of claw-back actions does not prevent other actions against the debtor in accordance
with law, which may be brought before the bankruptcy judge. Under no circumstances can the


-----

following be rescinded: (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary course of
the business cannot be rescinded, provided that they are carried out under market conditions, (ii)
actions contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or liquidation
of values and derivative instruments, (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of public law credits or
credits in favor of the labor authorities or (iv) transactions subject to foreign law in case the
beneficiary of the transaction can prove that such transaction cannot be rescinded under the law to
which it is subject to. The amended Spanish Insolvency Act has also included among the
transactions that cannot be subject to claw-back any transactions acknowledging and paying public
law credits to mitigate the debtor’s liability pursuant to the applicable criminal laws.

Neither Plans nor any transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any guarantees instituted in
the performance of such Plans will be subject to claw-back actions, provided that they comply with
the requirements set out below in section “Protection of certain Plans against claw-back”.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_**

Under Spanish law, in addition to the bankruptcy claw-back action, the insolvency administrator and
any creditor may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria pauliana)
against its debtor and the third-party which is a party to such contract or agreement, provided the
same is performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the
amounts owed in any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted
that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action:

- the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place
after such debt was created;

- the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third-party;
such act was fraudulent;

- there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages
suffered; and

- debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the
debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements
under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil
Code (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration and (ii)
transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia
_condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo)_
will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a _juris et de jure_
presumption (cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which
is a juris tantum presumption (a rebuttable presumption).

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third-party would be liable to return the consideration
received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the
creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If
the consideration received by the third-party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the
third- party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.

**_Protection of Certain Plans Against Claw-back_**

Certain Plans may be protected from claw-back risk provided that they comply with certain
requirements. In order to seek protection against claw-back, Plans can be judicially sanctioned
(homologado) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct a potential bankruptcy
proceeding, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such Plans. If the Plan


-----

affects claims that represent at least 51% of the debtor’s total liabilities, the following will not be
subject to claw-back unless it is proven that they were made with an intent to defraud creditors:

Actions and transactions that were “reasonable” and “immediately necessary” for the successful
negotiation of the Plan, if expressly identified as such in the Plan. Any payment of (i) fees or costs in
relation to negotiating, signing or confirming the Plan; (ii) fees for legal and professional advice
closely related with the restructuring; (iii) employee salaries for completed work; and (iv) other
amounts in the ordinary course of the debtor’s business activity, will be deemed to be protected
actions and transactions;

Interim and new money:

- Interim money: new financing granted to the debtor that is reasonable and immediately needed
to (i) ensure that the debtor’s activity continues totally or partially while the Plan is being
negotiated (and until a court approves it); or (ii) maintain or increase the value of the debtor’s
business or business units.

- New money: new financing granted to the debtor that is provided for in the Plan and is necessary
for its implementation.

Interim and new money may benefit from two effects:

- Protection against claw-back under the same terms as any other actions or transactions resulting
from the Plan. As a special rule, in order to protect interim or new money lent by a “specially
related party” to the debtor from claw-back, the claims affected by the Plan (after deducting any
claims held by specially related parties) must represent more than 60% of the debtor’s liabilities.
Otherwise, they will be subject to the ordinary claw-back regime.

- Preferential treatment for repayment of interim or new money: in the event of insolvency, 50%
of the interim or new money provided in the framework of a court-approved Plan will be treated
as a claim against the estate (crédito contra la masa). The remaining 50% will be treated as a
generally privileged claim (crédito con privilegio general).

This preferential treatment will only apply if the claims affected by the Plan exceed the minimum
thresholds described above with respect to the debtor’s total liabilities (i.e. 51% in general, and 60%
(after deducting any claims held by specially related parties) if interim or new money is granted by a
“specially related party” to the debtor). Actions and transactions that are reasonable and immediately
necessary to implement the Plan. If the Plan affects claims that represent less than 51% of the
debtor’s total liabilities, the actions and transactions described above _may still be subject to claw-_
back, but none of the rebuttable presumptions of detriment explained in section “Hardening Periods”
will apply. Therefore (as long as none of the non-rebuttable presumptions apply), the insolvency
administrator or the creditor requesting the claw- back will need to evidence the detriment.

Court approval of a Plan may be sought merely to ring-fence it from potential claw-back if the
debtor becomes insolvent (i.e., without seeking to cram down dissenting creditors). The court will
verify that the relevant majorities required for court approval are met before approving the Plan.
Judicially sanctioned Plans will not be subject to the bankruptcy claw-back action, but they may be
challenged pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law.

As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding
an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the Plan if it is favorably voted
upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in
the syndicated loan agreement. In any case, if the relevant threshold is satisfied, the Plan will be
deemed approved by the total amount of the creditors subject to the syndicated instrument. If the
threshold is not satisfied, votes of consenting creditors will be taken into account on an individual
basis, unless the syndicated claims constitute a single class of creditors (in which case it will be
deemed that class has not approved the Plan). In addition, dissenting creditors under a syndicated
instrument can challenge the Plan before the courts, unless the syndicated instrument provides
otherwise.


-----

All voting classes of creditors need not accept a Plan for it to be adopted for the Plan to become
binding for both (i) dissenting creditors in classes where a majority has been achieved (i.e. an intraclass cram- down); and (ii) creditors in classes where no majority has been achieved (i.e. a cross-class
cram-down). For this to happen, the Plan must meet one of the following two requirements: (a) it
must be supported by a simple majority of the classes, provided at least one of those classes is
composed of claims that would benefit from a general or special privilege (i.e. secured claims) if the
debtor were declared insolvent; or, failing that, (b) it must be supported by at least one of the classes
that is “in the money” (i.e. any class that could, upon a valuation of the debtor as a going concern by
the restructuring expert, be reasonably presumed to receive any payment according to the ranking of
liquidation priorities applicable under the Spanish Insolvency Act).

Following the above, a dissenting class subject to a haircut will be allowed to challenge the Plan
based on, among others, a more junior class (or the equity holders) receiving any payment from –or
maintaining any interest in– the debtor under the Plan (i.e., the absolute-priority rule). The Spanish
Insolvency Act, however, contains certain exceptions to the absolute-priority rule (it can be
derogated in order to ensure the viability of the company and that the affected creditors’ claims
would not be unjustifiably prejudiced).

The Spanish Insolvency Act contains three distinct sets of measures aimed at restricting
shareholders’ bargaining power and ensuring that they will not unreasonably frustrate or impede the
adoption, approval or implementation of a Plan.

The effects of a cross-class cram-down are subject to some limitations. If the Plan affects a class of
claims secured by rights in rem, and that class has rejected the Plan by a majority of dissenting votes
over favorable votes, any secured dissenting creditor of that class will have the right toenforce the
underlying security interest (which will accelerate the underlying secured claim) within a month of
the court ruling approving the Plan being published in the Public Insolvency Registry. If the
proceeds obtained from the enforcement:

- are lower than the security value of the collateral set out in the Plan, the creditor will keep those
proceeds in full (security value = 90% of “reasonable value” – legally preferred claims). Any
deficit will remain unsatisfied, or

- are higher than the security value collateral set out in the Plan, but lower than the original claim,
the creditor will keep those proceeds in full. Any excess will be deducted from the amounts that
the creditor’s unsecured part of the claim would be entitled to receive pursuant to the Plan; or

- alternatively, and only if expressly provided in the Plan, the dissenting creditor may wait to
receive a cash payment for the amount of the secured claim that is covered by the security value
of the collateral within no more than 120 days. If payment is not received in a timely manner, the
affected creditor will be entitled to enforce the security interest.

**_Applicable Jurisdiction_**

The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent
party has its “center of main interests.” This “center of main interests” is deemed to be where the
insolvent party conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be
recognized as such by third-parties. Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the “center of
main interests” are considered “the principal insolvency proceedings” and have universal reach
affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide, with certain exceptions, such as security
interests over assets located outside of Spain. If the “center of main interests” is not in Spain, but the
insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction
over the assets located in Spain (the “territorial insolvency proceedings”).

In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction, Article 261 of the current Spanish Insolvency Act may
apply, in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by a Spanish


-----

Guarantor may be classified as “contingent” claims and no amount may be recognized until and
when a default occurs and the guarantee is validly enforced. Nor will they have voting rights. Special
rules can apply if the guarantee is not a first demand guarantee but an ordinary guarantee (fianza)
and, therefore, the benefits of preference (excusión), order (orden) and division (división) apply.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforcement of the Guarantees and Security Interests_**

_Ancillary nature (principio de accesoriedad)_

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee or security interest must guarantee or secure a
primary obligation to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the
guarantee or security agreement, and the nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the
nullity or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security interest. Consequently, if the primary
obligation is terminated, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be deemed null and
void. In the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are no existing
and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the guarantor or
security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not
enforceable. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced in Spain without
having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing
the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver,
repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations.

A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default
were of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of
acceleration, a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on
objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by
Article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code.

_Corporate benefit_

All acts and transactions performed and carried out by a Spanish company must be in pursuit of and
aligned with its corporate benefit and, in particular, directors have a duty to act in the best interest of
the Spanish company, although there is no express Spanish mandatory law provision that requires an
express and direct corporate benefit.

The absence of such a corporate benefit may constitute grounds to challenge such acts and
transactions. When assessing whether or not directors have acted in the best interest of a Spanish
company, only the interest of such Spanish company is taken into account. Accordingly, transactions
undertaken for the benefit of the group may not always be considered consistent with the best
interest of the Spanish company. In the context of upstream and cross-stream guarantees, the Spanish
Supreme Court has ruled that the subsidiary granting the guarantee or security interest to secure the
debt of its parent company or other company of its group, should receive some kind of consideration
or benefit, either directly or indirectly, to compensate the financial burden assumed in the interest of
the group. This compensation (i) must be verifiable, even if it is not received simultaneously to the
delivery of the guarantee or security, (ii) must be adequate and proportional to the burden assumed
by the relevant company in the interest of its group, and (iii) must have an economic value.
Furthermore, the action undertaken in the interest of the group must be justified and must not put the
solvency of the subsidiary into jeopardy. If these limitations were not observed, the Notes guarantees
could be subject to legal challenge.

_Financial assistance restrictions_

The obligations of the Spanish guarantor under its Guarantee or under any security instrument
granted by it cannot extend to any obligation which, if incurred, would constitute a breach of the
Spanish financial assistance rules. Pursuant to these rules, no guarantee or security interest granted
by a Spanish Guarantor may guarantee or secure any payment, prepayment, repayment or
reimbursement obligations derived from any finance document used, or that may be used, for the


-----

purposes of payment of certain acquisitions or the payment of any costs or transaction expenses
related to, or paying the purchase price for, such acquisitions.

In particular, the Spanish Companies Act prohibits financial assistance: (i) with respect to Spanish
public limited companies (sociedades anónimas), in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or
the shares of any direct or indirect parent company, and (ii) with respect to Spanish private limited
companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), in relation to the acquisition of their own
shares and the shares of any member of their corporate group.

Therefore, Spanish law governed guarantees or security interests granted or assumed by subsidiaries
incorporated under the laws of Spain shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred for the
purpose of acquiring, directly or indirectly, the shares of such Spanish subsidiary or the shares of its
direct or indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of their group, to the extent that
such security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article
150 and 143 of the Spanish Companies Act. This limitation may also apply to the refinancing of
acquisition debt. Accordingly, any guarantee or security interest granted by any Spanish subsidiary
shall not apply to the extent the proceeds are used to repay indebtedness if such indebtedness was
used for the purposes described above. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, the
guarantee or security interest granted by any Spanish company will be null and void if it breaches
Spanish financial assistance regulations.

_Capitalization_

Under Spanish law there are some provisions on capitalization which have to be taken into account
when guarantees are enforced. For example, when the enforcement of the guarantee causes the
amount of the relevant Spanish subsidiary net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share
capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is
increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the balance between its net equity and
its share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency. Pursuant to the special
regulations approved in the context of COVID-19, there is an interim regime whereby any losses
incurred during financial years 2020 and 2021 will not be taken into account to determine if a
Spanish company is in a capital impairment situation. However, if the losses incurred in 2022 result
in a capital impairment situation of the company, the directors shall call the general shareholders’
meeting within 2 months following closing of such financial year.

In addition, and while this remains a matter debated between Spanish scholars, it is possible that
certain defenses available to the Spanish Guarantor relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, capital preservation or thin capitalization may limit the
amount guaranteed under the Guarantee by reference to the net assets and share capital of the Spanish
Guarantor and the amount secured under the relevant security agreement by reference to the value of
the collateral.

_Potential limitations to guarantees provided by private limited companies (sociedades de_
_responsabilidad limitada)_

Under the Spanish Companies Act, Spanish public limited companies (sociedades anónimas) and
private limited companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada) may issue and guarantee (or
provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities recognizing or creating
indebtedness. However, private limited companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada) are
subject to certain restrictions. In particular, pursuant to Article 401 of the Spanish Companies Act,
Spanish private limited companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada) may only issue notes up
to an amount equal to twice their net equity (recursos propios), unless the notes are secured by a
mortgage, a pledge over securities, a public guarantee (garantía pública) or a joint and several
guarantee granted by a credit institution. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the limitations of Article 401 of the Spanish Companies Act apply to any guarantee
or security of notes provided by a Spanish private limited companies (sociedades de responsabilidad


-----

_limitada), such guarantee or security shall be limited accordingly._

There is no unanimous opinion among scholars and practitioners and no case law on the
interpretation of Article 401 of the Spanish Companies Act as to whether the restriction contained
therein should apply not only to the issuance of notes, but also to the guarantee provided by private
limited companies for such notes. Consensus has not yet been reached on the above limitations
applicable to private limited companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada).

_Court enforceability_

Under Spanish law, claims may become time barred (five years being the general term established
for obligations in personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be
or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

The terms “enforceable,” “enforceability,” “valid,” “legal,” “binding” and “effective” (or any
combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the
relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these
obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms.
Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to the nature of the remedies available,
and the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off (unless validly waived),
circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho),
misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and
counterclaim.

_Trust and security agent under Spanish law_

Spanish law does not recognize the concepts of “trust” or “security agent” and there is some
uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of a security agent
(including the Security Agent) and whether this would cause delays in the enforcement and the
consequences of not being able to enforce the collateral as provided in the relevant security
agreements. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the Security Agent and/or the
Trustee, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the
Security Agent and/or the Trustee’s actions in an enforcement situation. Some legal scholars argue
that a security agent (such as the Security Agent) or a trustee (such as the Trustee) would only be
entitled to enforce its portion of the secured obligation but not that of the other secured parties.
Therefore, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties
through the Security Agent and/or the Trustee, and enforcement thereof by the Security Agent and/or
the Trustee, may be subject to a due and express power of attorney granted by each of the secured
parties in favor of the Security Agent and/or the Trustee for such purpose, duly notarized and legalized
(and, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961).

Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties
through the Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the
secured parties, has not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and
several creditor is not expressly contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and
several creditor does not hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. As a result, the ability of the
Security Agent to represent the Trustee and the holders of the Notes may be challenged.

According to Spanish law, the law governing in rem legal aspects of a pledge is the law applicable in
the place of location of the pledged asset (lex rei sitae). When the pledged asset is a credit right—
such as receivables or intercompany loans—the determination of the lex rei sitae is unclear given its
lack of physical existence. In these cases, several theories have been construed amongst Spanish
scholars so as to determine the _lex rei sitae_ (such as domicile of debtor of the credit rights being
pledged, domicile of pledgor, law governing the credit right being pledged, etc.). If a judge considered
that any of the pledges created over credit rights under the Spanish security documents is governed


-----

by the Catalonian Civil Code, then this regulation would govern those pledges instead of the Spanish
civil common law, which could determine the challenge of the validity of such pledges.

_Parallel debt_

The concept of “parallel debt” may be questioned under Spanish law and we are not aware of any
court precedent where it has been recognized by a Spanish Court. Without notarization of the
security documents, the secured parties will not have access to the executive summary proceedings
(juicio ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain, having the
secured parties to follow necessarily the ordinary judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario).

**Australia**

Australian law imposes a strict duty on directors of a company to prevent insolvent trading. For
directors, failure to prevent insolvent trading carries with it a risk of personal liability under section
588G of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the “Australian Corporations Act”), which if
established can result in civil and criminal penalties. Certain Guarantors are incorporated under the
laws of Australia (“Australian Guarantors”). Therefore, insolvency processes with respect to them are
likely to be governed by Australian insolvency law. The insolvency law and processes which apply in
Australia are different from the insolvency laws of the United States.

If an Australian Guarantor becomes insolvent, the treatment and ranking of holders of the Notes, other
creditors of the company and the shareholders under Australian law may be different to the resulting
treatment and ranking if that Australian Guarantor was subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United
States or other jurisdictions. There are four principal corporate insolvency processes in Australia: (a)
administration (sometimes referred to as voluntary administration); (b) deed of company arrangement;
(c) liquidation (also referred to as winding up); and (d) receivership. There is also a fifth less common
regime pursuant to a scheme of arrangement. A brief description of each process is set out below.

**_Administration_**

Under section 435A of the Australian Corporations Act, the object of administration is to provide for
the business, property and affairs of an insolvent company to be administered in a way that maximizes
the chances of the company, or as much as possible of its business, continuing in existence.
Alternatively, if it is not possible for the company or its business to continue in existence, the object
of the administration is to achieve a better return for the company’s creditors and members than
would result from an immediate winding up of the company.

A company is placed into administration by: (i) a resolution of its board of directors if the board
resolves that the company is insolvent or is likely to become insolvent at some future time; (ii) a
liquidator, or a provisional liquidator, of the company if the liquidator or provisional liquidator thinks
the company is insolvent or is likely to become insolvent at some future time; or (iii) a secured
creditor who is entitled to enforce its security over the whole or substantially the whole of the
company’s property (although a secured creditor would usually prefer to appoint a receiver who,
unlike an administrator, will, subject to some duties being owed to the company and other creditors,
primarily act in the interests of the secured creditor). Within eight business days of that administrator
being appointed, a meeting of the debtor’s creditors (termed “the first meeting of creditors”) is to be
held at which the creditors may pass a resolution to remove and replace the administrators appointed
to the company, and decide whether to appoint a committee of creditors. An administration is
intended to be for a short period and culminates in “the second meeting of creditors” (which must be
held within five business days before or after the 20 business-day convening period following
commencement of the administration, or 25 business-day convening period if the administration
commenced in December or within 25 business days of Good Friday), but this time period may be
extended by an adjournment of the second meeting of creditors or by court order. During the
administration, an administrator controls the company and acts as its agent. The powers of the


-----

directors and officers are suspended, though they remain in office and have a duty to assist the
administrator. Transfers of shares in the company are void unless the administrator gives his or her
written consent or a court authorizes the transfer. The administrator’s role is to investigate and report
to creditors on the company’s business, property, affairs and financial circumstances leading up to the
appointment, and its options (being liquidation, execution of a deed of company arrangement or to
return the company to the control of its directors) and report to creditors as to the administrator’s
recommendation on which option is in the best interests of creditors. The creditors in the second
meeting of creditors vote on which option is to be adopted and a resolution is carried on the voices by
a simple majority (in number) of those present and voting, unless a poll is conducted in which case a
resolution is carried if a majority of creditors voting (both by number and in value) vote in favor of
the resolution. Once passed, the resolution is binding on all of the company’s unsecured creditors. If
secured creditors elect not to vote on the resolution, they will not be bound by it. The capacity to vote
on the resolution gives secured creditors a significant measure of control over the outcome of the
administration procedure, in particular where a deed of company arrangement will provide the most
desirable outcome for secured creditors.

To permit the administrator the opportunity to make an assessment, for the duration of the
administration there is a stay on the enforcement of creditors’ claims, actions against the company and
its property (subject to certain exceptions) and legal proceedings unless the administrator consents or
the court grants leave. Any security interest existing in the property of the company under the
Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (“PPSA”) which, immediately before the time of
appointment of the administrator, has not been perfected in accordance with the PPSA, will (subject to
limited exceptions) vest in the company upon the appointment of the administrator and accordingly
will not be enforceable by the secured creditor.

An administrator is required to give notice of his appointment to any secured creditor who has a
security over “the whole or substantially the whole” of the company’s assets. This creditor is
permitted to enforce its security interest within the 13 business day period from the commencement of
the administration. It is common for secured lenders to take security over the whole or substantially
the whole of the property of Australian companies to avail themselves of this exception. A court, on
the application of the administrator, may limit a secured creditor’s or receiver’s powers in relation to
secured property and these orders may only be made if the court is satisfied that the administrator will
adequately protect the secured creditor’s interests. If a receiver is not appointed before the
administration or during the decision period or otherwise during the administration with the consent
of the administrator, an administrator may dispose of secured property in the ordinary course of
business, with the secured creditor’s consent or with the leave of the court.

**_Deed of Company Arrangement_**

A company progresses into a deed of company arrangement when a company’s creditors resolve at
the second meeting of creditors held during the administration that the company execute a deed of
company arrangement. The administrators are appointed the deed administrators unless creditors
resolve to appoint other individuals. A deed of company arrangement is a compromise agreement
binding on the company, its creditors, officers and members. All pre-appointment unsecured creditors
are bound by the deed of company arrangement even though they did not vote in favor of it.

Once the deed of company arrangement is executed, the administration terminates and the statutory
moratorium restrictions come to an end, however they are usually replicated in the provisions of the
deed. During the period of a deed of company arrangement, secured creditors may in certain
circumstances enforce over the secured property so long as they are not prevented from enforcing by
an order of the court. A court, on the application of the deed administrator, may limit a secured
creditor’s or receiver’s powers in relation to secured property and these orders may only be made if
the court is satisfied that the deed administrator will adequately protect the secured creditor’s
interests. The deed administrator may be tasked by the deed with realizing assets, closing down the


-----

business, restructuring the company or pursuing litigation with a view to the payment of dividends to
creditors.

The deed may provide for the compromise of certain creditors’ claims, payment of creditors by
installment or specify that different creditors are to be treated differently, so long as the deed provides
for a better return to creditors than they would receive in a liquidation. The order of distribution of
proceeds to creditors will be specified in the deed and can, in some circumstances and subject to
certain limitations, be different to the order which applies in liquidation. Once the tasks specified by
the deed are completed and proceeds distributed to creditors, the deed usually specifies that the
company is released from pre-appointment unsecured debts and the deed terminates.

**_Liquidation_**

A company is placed into liquidation by (i) a court order (on the application of the company, a
creditor, a contributory, a director, a liquidator or provisional liquidator or a prescribed agency); (ii)
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission; or (iii) voluntarily by a special resolution of
the company’s members. A liquidator controls the company and acts as its agent. The powers of the
directors and officers are suspended and they have a duty to assist the liquidator. The company ceases
to carry on its business except to the extent the liquidator believes this is necessary for the beneficial
disposal of the company or the winding up of that business. Transfers of shares in the company are
void unless the liquidator gives his written consent or a court authorizes the transfer. There is a stay
on court proceedings against the company and on enforcement processes except with the leave of the
court. However, the rights of secured creditors are not affected by this stay.

The purpose of a liquidation is to enable the realization of all of a company’s assets, the calling up of
partly paid shares, a proof of debt process and the distribution of the proceeds among the company’s
creditors and (if there is a surplus after paying creditors) a distribution of the surplus to members. The
distribution of proceeds will be subject to statutory priority rules. The company’s existence will then
be brought to an end by deregistration. Generally speaking, to the extent their security is sufficient,
secured creditors stand outside the liquidation. Generally speaking, secured creditors do not have to
prove for their debts and they have the right to enforce their security and to receive the proceeds,
subject to priority payments, including without limitation the rights of any higher priority security
holders, liquidation fees and expenses and certain payments which have priority over circulating
security interests (see below under receivership).

**_Receivership_**

Receivers are typically appointed by a secured creditor under the terms of a security. A receiver’s
appointment in respect of secured property can continue during an administration or a liquidation of
the company (subject to the exceptions above). A receiver’s powers are usually governed by the terms
of the security under which they are appointed and the Australian Corporations Act. The receiver’s
principal task is to take possession and control of the secured property and realize the property subject
to the security and subject to priority payments, pay the proceeds to the security holder. A receiver is
ordinarily appointed as an agent of the company and owes residual duties to the company, unsecured
creditors and shareholders, as an officer of the company. A receiver has a duty to take all reasonable
care to sell secured property for not less than market value or, if there is no market value, the best
price reasonably obtainable having regard to the circumstances existing at that time.

One important example of a priority payment that ranks ahead of secured debt is where a secured
creditor holds a circulating security interest (being a security interest in respect of “circulating assets”
which are defined in the PPSA), there are preferred creditor claims which rank in priority to the
secured creditor and must be paid out of any enforcement proceeds before any proceeds are remitted
to the secured creditor, to the extent of a shortfall on non-circulating assets. The most common of
these claims are certain employee entitlements.


-----

Another important priority payment example is that a receiver may have an obligation to discharge
from enforcement proceeds any tax payable on any income, profits or gains in respect of the assets
sold in priority to the secured creditor.

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

A scheme of arrangement is an arrangement or compromise which binds the company and its
creditors or members even though a minority of those creditors or members may oppose it. Schemes
of arrangement are generally used for larger and more complex restructurings in in Australia as they
are longer and more costly than the administration and deed of company arrangement process.

**_Limits to Enforcement of Guarantees and Security_**

The Australian Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the Notes, which will provide the holders of
the Notes with a direct claim against each Australian Guarantor. However, enforcement of the
Guarantees and the security will be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and
defenses include, without limitation, those that relate to corporate benefit, voidable preference,
uncommercial transaction (including transaction at undervalue), unreasonable director-related
transaction, breaches of directors’ duties, unconscionable conduct, economic duress, penalties or other
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally which could render the
security or the Guarantees limited, void, unenforceable or ultra vires. If any of the security is voided
or unenforceable, it is possible that you will be left with an unsecured claim against the Australian
Guarantors or if the Guarantees are voided you may be left with no claim against the Australian
Guarantors and a claim solely against the Issuer.

If, on the application of a company’s liquidator, a court is satisfied that a transaction of the company
is a voidable transaction, it may make a variety of orders which are set out in section 588FF of the
Australian Corporations Act. These orders include an order releasing or discharging, wholly or partly,
a debt incurred, or a security or guarantee given, by the company under or in connection with the
transaction or an order requiring a party to repay to the company some or all of the benefits it received
under the transaction. It is not a prerequisite of a voidable transaction to establish that the directors of
the company have breached their duties to the company in any way or that the person taking the
benefit of the guarantee or security had actual or constructive notice that the transaction was a
voidable transaction.

Additionally, certain security interests over circulating assets may be void against a liquidator
pursuant to section 588FJ of the Australian Corporations Act and loans may be challenged on the
basis they are unfair loans under section 588FD of the Australian Corporations Act. There are various
time periods within which a liquidator can take such action depending on the nature of the transaction
being challenged. The test for insolvency in Australia in this context is whether the relevant company
is able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable.

**_Limits to the Enforcement of “Ipso Facto” Rights_**

The Australian Corporations Act has recently been amended to effect certain reforms to Australian
insolvency laws. Under the Act, any right under a contract, agreement or arrangement (such as a right
entitling a creditor to terminate a contract or to accelerate a payment under a contract) arising merely
because a company is subject to a voluntary administration, receivership (where the receiver is
appointed over the whole or substantially the whole of its property), small business restructuring or a
creditors’ scheme of arrangement or because of its financial position during such proceedings (i.e.
“ipso facto rights”), will not be enforceable during a prescribed moratorium period. The specified
circumstances do not include a winding up or liquidation.

These reforms became effective on July 1, 2018 and apply to ipso facto rights arising in respect of
entities that are able to be the subject of the relevant insolvency proceedings referred to above (which


-----

relevantly would include any Australian Guarantor) under contracts, agreements or arrangements
entered into at or after July 1, 2018 or which are amended, novated or assigned after 1 July 2023,
subject to certain exclusions specified in the applicable Australian Corporations Regulations and
Declarations (the “Exceptions”).

The Exceptions provide that a contract, agreement or arrangement that is, or governs securities,
financial products, bonds or promissory notes will be exempt from the moratorium. Furthermore, a
contract, agreement or arrangement that is, or is directly connected with, a securities financing
transaction is also excluded from the stay. Accordingly, the Exceptions should exclude from the stay
those Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral that are granted by Australian Guarantors.
However, as the relevant provisions of the Australian Corporations Act and the Exceptions have not
been the subject of judicial consideration or interpretation (other than one judicial decision) there
remains uncertainty as to the operation of the legislation and the extent to which such exceptions
would apply to guarantees or security granted by an Australian Guarantor. If the Exceptions are
determined not to exclude those Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral that are granted by
Australian Guarantors, this may render unenforceable for the period of the moratorium in Australia
any provisions of those Guarantees and security interests that are granted by Australian Guarantors
and that apply on the occurrence of events giving rise to ipso facto rights.

**_Other Grounds_**

Under Australian law, a guarantee or security given by a company may also be set aside on a number
of additional grounds. For example, a guarantee or security may be unenforceable against a guarantor
or grantor if the directors of the guarantor or grantor did not comply with their duties to act in good
faith for the benefit of the guarantor or grantor and for a proper purpose in giving the guarantee or
security. The issue is particularly relevant where a company provides a guarantee or security in
relation to the obligations of another member of its corporate family, as is the case for the Guarantees
and Collateral with respect to the Notes. In determining whether there is sufficient corporate benefit to
the guarantor or grantor, all relevant facts and circumstances of the transaction need to be considered
by the directors, including the benefits and detriments to the guarantor or grantor in giving the
guarantee or security, and the respective benefits to the other parties involved in the transaction.
Whether a guarantee or security entered into in breach of directors’ duties can be avoided against a
party relying on the guarantee or security depends on certain factors, including the state of knowledge
of that party, and whether the party knew of or suspected the breach. Also, under Australian law,
generally speaking and subject to certain exceptions and limitations, a person is entitled to assume
that the directors have properly performed their duties to the company unless that person knows or
suspects that they have not done so. In addition, other debts and liabilities of the Australian
Guarantors and the Issuer, such as certain employee entitlements or amounts owed to tax authorities,
may rank ahead of claims under the security.

The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (“Model Law”) has force of law in
Australia through the enactment of the Australian Cross Border Insolvency Act 2008 (Cth). The
Model Law includes provisions for the co-operation of the Australian courts with representatives of
foreign insolvency proceedings and provides for the facilitation of those insolvency proceedings in
Australia.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

One or more of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices
in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany (the “German Guarantors”).
Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regards to a German Guarantor is likely to be initiated
in Germany and, if the relevant German Guarantor were held to have its center of main interests
within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings


-----

(Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such
proceedings.

However, under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings over certain assets of a German
Guarantor may be opened in other jurisdictions, in particular if such assets are located in another
Member State of the European Union. With respect to cross-border group insolvencies, Art 56 et seq.
Recast Insolvency Regulation introduced requirements facilitating communication and cooperation
between the administrators and courts involved. In addition, a coordination procedure may be
initiated, which involves the appointment of a coordinator and the adoption of a cross-border
coordination plan. See “—European Union.”

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) or the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG), may not be as
favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of the United States or another
jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the
ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as, in certain circumstances, priority recovery for
secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to
recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other
insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung):

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court _ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of_
insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor
in the event of over indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit), the latter meaning that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as
and when they fall due for a period longer than three weeks. According to the relevant provision of
the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed
the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s
business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) generally based on
a 12 months’ forecast horizon (positive Fortführungsprognose). However, for the period of time
between January 1, 2021 and until December 31, 2023, § 4 SanInsKG shortens the relevant forecast
horizon to four months, which means that the relevant test is up and until September 1, 2023 already
met if the continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern for the next four month is
predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich). After according to legal literature, for balance
sheet solvency testing after September 1, 2023, the also circumstances outside the four months (but
inside the 12 months) horizon need to be taken into account when determining if the continuation of
the debtor’s business as a going concern for the next four month is predominantly likely (überwiegend
_wahrscheinlich)._

If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a public limited liability
company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas
_Europaea) or any other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner_
finds itself in a situation of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or over indebtedness
(Überschuldung), each managing director of such company and, in certain circumstances, its
shareholders or members of the supervisory board, are obligated to file for insolvency without undue
delay but not later than three weeks after such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or six weeks after
such over indebtedness (Überschuldung) occurred or (as the case may be) was established. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damages claims as well as
sanctions under criminal law. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or for restructuring proceedings (see “—Preventive Restructuring
_Framework“) in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the_
imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due at some point in
time within a look-forward period of usually 24 months, whereas imminent illiquidity (drohende


-----

_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for_
insolvency proceedings.

A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (vorläufige
_Eigenverwaltung), if, in general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turn-_
around plan to be implemented by way of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court
is not aware of any circumstances that indicate that key aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based
on incorrect assumptions. If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit)
and/or is over-indebted (überschuldet), but not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), it may also file for
preliminary “debtor in possession” protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren), unless—
from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. Upon
such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and
prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets). It may also implement
other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three
months. During the period of either the preliminary debtor-in-possession proceedings (vorläufige
_Eigenverwaltung) or the protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren), the debtor shall_
prepare an insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in formal “debtor-in-possession”
proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may
take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). In particular, the insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any
measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary
proceedings (other than with respect to immoveable assets) or, to the extent required to ensure the
continuation of the debtor’s business, prohibit the enforcement of any collateral granted over claims,
rights or other movable assets of debtor. If the enforcement of collateral is prohibited by the
insolvency court, secured creditors have to be adequately compensated by the insolvency estate.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event
the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will
supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint
a preliminary trustee or preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The
rights and duties of the preliminary administrator or the preliminary trustee depend on the decision of
the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator or preliminary trustee may include safeguarding
and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to
cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even
the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary
insolvency administrator, whilst in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings, the debtor’s management
retains the right to manage business. However, the court may also order that certain disposals of the
debtor may require the preliminary trustee’s consent also in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings. The
insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the
debtor.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary
creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the
following three requirements:

###### • a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted);

 • revenue of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or

 • fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis (including, inter alios, part time


-----

###### employees).

The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in
the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the
following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter),
preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) or
trustee (Sachwalter), and court orders for “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Anordnung der
_Eigenverwaltung) or consent to important disposals of the estate._

The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal
requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition
has been filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebtedness and (ii) if there are sufficient assets
to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to
be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if
third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets
(Abweisung mangels Masse).

Unless the court has granted “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case
the court will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by
the debtor), upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the
debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency
creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency
administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such
change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims)
has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the
proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced
and impartial. Individual creditors, or the debtor, can request the insolvency court to remove the
insolvency administrator only on the grounds of a lack of impartiality and only within six months
from the appointment. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of “debtor in possession
proceedings”, the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue
the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate
(Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any unsecured insolvency liabilities created by the
debtor including, e.g., the Guarantees. Residual claims of a secured insolvency creditors remaining
after realization of the respective collateral (if any) also qualify as unsecured insolvency claim in this
regard. However, in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings, the debtor shall only incur estate liabilities in
the ordinary course of business without the trustee’s (Sachwalter) consent.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be
effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become
unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

The insolvency administrator (or trustee in case of “debtor-in-possession proceedings”) may also
challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected
prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent
_Transfer”)._

For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings
against any German Guarantor would include, among possible voidance actions and other things, the
following:

- unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to
administer and dispose of a German Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;


-----

- unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals
effected by a German Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are
null and void by operation of law;

- if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a
creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security
interest in part of the relevant insolvency debtor’s property that would normally form part of the
insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of
the insolvency proceedings;

- claims against the relevant German Guarantor may generally only be pursued in accordance with
the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

- any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e. the relevant asset of this person
does not constitute a part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency
proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court
proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the
insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency and restructuring law, termination rights, automatic termination events or
“escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic
termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party,
the filing for insolvency or restructuring proceedings or the occurrence of reasons justifying the
opening of insolvency or restructuring proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder
_Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid in case of insolvency proceedings such clause would frustrate the_
election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des
_Insolvenzverwalters) unless such clause only reflects termination rights applicable under statutory_
law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from
the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors of the estate (Massegläubiger)
as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor
need to participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and
the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor with the insolvency administrator. With the exception
of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its
creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so
ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when
insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and
creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings
separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, also unsecured creditors may file their claims in
the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the
extent sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their
security interests after insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the
relevant collateral but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency
proceedings. In this case, secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus costs
and fees) from such realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a
secured creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on
the type of security. The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any
movable assets within its possession that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g.,
pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security
(Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment


-----

agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). As opposed thereto and according to recent case law of the
German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), secured creditors are entitled to realize pledges
over uncertificated shares or other rights on their own. That having been said, the German Federal
Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) viewed in an older decision the insolvency administrator
competent to realize pledged shares in a corporation that have been certificated (verbrieft) and are
hold in a custodian account (Depot) in Germany in case the shares represent more than 20% in the
issued share capital of the pledged company. This decision was not explicitly overtaken in the more
recent decision.

Even if the law assigns the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral to the insolvency
administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal
proceeds (Ersatzabsonderungsrecht).

The enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges of the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse) of 9% of the realized value (or as agreed upon individually, but in any case at least
4%) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the
creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured
claims. Remaining amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse) (being the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor) and would, after deduction
of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary insolvency
administrator, the insolvency administrator and the insolvency court as well as the members of the
(preliminary) creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be
distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Notes (to the
extent not satisfied after enforcement of other Collateral securing the Notes). If a German Guarantor
or a subsidiary thereof subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to
creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of
creditors secured by such security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the
proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from
such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the guarantee obligations under the Notes by the
German Guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator, however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it
may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are
distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed
in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency
administrator or, in “debtor-in-possession proceedings”, by the trustee (upon instruction of the
preliminary creditors’ committee or the creditors’ meeting) and which requires, in principle, the
consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific
majority rules. The insolvency court may order the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor
groups under certain conditions (cram down). The insolvency plan may derogate from the provisions
of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In particular, it may contain provisions regarding
the discharge of secured and unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as
procedure. It may also create, modify, transfer or terminate rights in rem such as property rights or
security interests. If the debtor is a corporate entity, the shares or, as the case may be, the partnership
interests in the debtor can also be included in the insolvency plan, including an issuance of shares or
partnership interests to third parties or to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an
insolvency plan could under certain circumstances provide for provisions, inter alios, regarding the
Guarantees or the Collateral granted by the relevant German Guarantor, which are less favorable to
the holders of the Notes than the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), such
as the release of Collateral granted by the relevant German Guarantor or the release of obligations
under the relevant Guarantee. Under certain conditions, such provisions could be adopted against the
votes of the affected holders of the Notes. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a
debt-to-equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt-for-equity swap under the proposed
insolvency plan.


-----

An insolvency plan can further provide for the release or other impairment of guarantees or other
security interests provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten), without such debtor
affiliates being required to become subject of the debtor’s or separate insolvency proceedings,
provided that the relevant debtor affiliate consents to the impairment. Creditors affected by such
impairment are entitled to receive adequate compensation. This means that the claims under the
relevant Guarantees can get impaired if the Issuer would enter into German insolvency proceedings,
regardless of whether or not the relevant German Guarantor is itself subject of insolvency
proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an
insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular,
no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-a-vis each
entity have to be dealt with separately. However, the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)
has provisions to facilitate the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of
group companies. Whereas these provisions do not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency
proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a
group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, they stipulate four
key measures in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court
may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppengerichtsstand),
(ii) a single person may be appointed as insolvency administrator for all relevant group companies;
(iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and
creditors’ committees, and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordinator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the
ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the coordination court
(Koordinationsgericht).

As a general principle, the claims arising from the Guarantee may be enforced against the relevant
German Guarantor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the relevant German
Guarantor, as applicable. Any insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuer would, however,
be a rather strong indication that the overall financial situation of the entire group of affiliated
companies has significantly deteriorated, which may cause a German Guarantor to subsequently file
for insolvency.

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law
(including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor
for the return of repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions, but except for government
developments banks and its affiliates). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the
Indenture may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a
“shareholder like” position (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency
proceeding over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims arising from the Notes or a Guarantee
would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen).
Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the
assets of a German Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special
permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast
majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of
the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to claims
of regular, unsecured creditors.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or, in the event
that “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) have been granted, the trustee
(Sachwalter) may also challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed
detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency
proceedings during applicable voidance periods. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge


-----

transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period
prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany,
the payment of any amounts to the holders of Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or
providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an
insolvency administrator or, as the case may be, a trustee under the rules of avoidance as set forth in
the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If the validity or enforceability of the Guarantees or
any Collateral granted by the relevant German Guarantor in favor of the Notes is challenged
successfully, the holder of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the Guarantees or
the relevant Collateral granted by the relevant German Guarantor. If payments have already been
made under the Notes, the Guarantee or the relevant Collateral granted by the relevant German
Guarantor, any amounts received from a transaction that had been challenged would have to be repaid
to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim
under the Guarantees without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the
granting of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases:

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (a)
during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency
proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the
creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor
was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig)) at such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit)
or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende
_Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or_
of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not
entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor
was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (a) such act was taken during the last month
prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such
filing, (b) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition
and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at such time or (c) such act was taken during the
second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other
insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such
detrimental effect); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as
described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the detrimental nature of such
transaction for other creditors;

- any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which
the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a
debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (a) during the three
months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and
the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to
such transaction knew of the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at such time or (b) after the filing
of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such
transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or such filing at the time
of the transaction (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende
_Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity_


-----

(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

- any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to
prejudice the insolvency creditors if the other party knew of such intention at the time of such
act with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was
at least imminent (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the transaction disadvantaged the
other creditors. For granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain
security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled (kongruente Deckung), such
knowledge is (solely) presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) (as opposed to the knowledge of imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) if such creditor did not had a respective claim for security or satisfaction_
(inkongruente Deckung)) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. Apart from
that, such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain
security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in
a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled to such security or
satisfaction), may only be avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the
petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing. There is a
rebuttable presumption that, if the debtor reached a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung)
with the creditor or the creditor granted any other form of deferred payment
(Zahlungserleichterungen) to the debtor, he had no knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at the time of the transaction;

- any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an
“affiliated party” (nahestehende Person), as described below, which directly operates to the
detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two
years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other
party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the
contract was concluded;

- any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security
(including a guarantee) for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition
for the commencement of insolvency proceedings;

- any act that grants security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for
a claim under a shareholder loan granted to the debtor or a commercially equivalent claim if (a)
in the case of the granting of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of
the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition,
or (b) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. This does
not apply (a) to shareholders that own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged
in management and (b) until the sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the debtor
in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or
imminent illiquidity with the intension to restructure the debtor; and

- any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction to a third party for a loan claim or an equivalent
claim if (a) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (b) a shareholder of the debtor had
granted security for such loan or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder
_Bürge) for such loan (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the_
amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from
which the conclusion must be drawn that, e.g., the debtor (e.g., a German Guarantor) was unable to


-----

pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had
been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the
case may be. Knowledge of pending restructuring proceedings (see—“Preventive Restructuring
_Framework”) per se does not suffice for a creditor to be deemed to have such “knowledge”. With_
respect to an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person), there is a general statutory presumption that
such party had “knowledge”.

In relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) includes, subject to
certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and
shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding
comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor,
and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing
persons.

The granting of a security concurrently with the incurrence of debt funded as new money may be
qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged. Meaning, under certain circumstances
it may not be subject to avoidance rights under the German Insolvency Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg).
According to recent case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), however,
this privilege does not apply to claims as described under (vii) above.

Any kind of newly granted third-party financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also
commercial credits and other forms of financing) and respective collateral as well as shareholder
loans under German insolvency law avoidance provisions, which have been granted from March 1,
2020 until September 30, 2020 are privileged under German insolvency law due to the CovInsAG.
Thus, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder
loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant
financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in certain cases, if the debtor
fulfilled the respective requirements for a further suspension of the filing duties at the time, until
December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021). Loans granted, and security taken, by certain public
institutions as part of COVID-19 subsidies remain privileged even if granted or taken after that
period. The general privilege also includes the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing
providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or
receivables from economically similar acts.

Furthermore, any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan (see—”Preventive Restructuring
_Framework”) are not subject to avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige_
_Sanierung) of the debtor is achieved, unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or_
incomplete information presented by the debtor and the addressee of the avoidance action had
knowledge thereof. This privilege under the German Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG)
does not apply to shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral provided
therefor.

Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the
insolvency estate. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended
existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable towards another creditor
if (i) such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating
such debtor’s (impending) insolvency (for which knowledge of pendent restructuring proceedings
(see—”Preventive Restructuring Framework”) per se does not suffice) at the time such funding was
provided or extended or such security was granted and (ii) the other creditor suffered losses caused by
a delayed filing for insolvency based on the additional or extended existing funding. The German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, e.g., the creditor was to
act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in
violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if
the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the
grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire
further with respect thereto. If, however, such was additional funding has been provided or existing


-----

funding has been extended or respective collateral has been granted between March 1, 2020 and
September 30, 2020 (in certain cases, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021), any such
transaction is statutorily exempted from the lender liability concept as laid out above.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the claims of the creditors against the debtor on the date
when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking behind
the general unsecured claims of insolvency creditors in the following order and according to the
proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status:

- interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of
the opening of the insolvency proceedings;

- costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings;

- fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal
consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money;

- claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and

- claims under a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from commercially
similar transactions.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG).

Based on EU Restructuring Directive, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG)
has come into force on January 1, 2021. The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides
for a new pre-insolvency procedure to restructure the liabilities of debtors, whose “center of main
interest” is located in Germany. This may apply to the German Guarantors. As the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1, 2021, no long
standing (court) practice exists as of the date of this offering memorandum and consequently any
proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) come with certain
degree of uncertainty.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of an initiation of restructuring
proceedings by a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its center of main interest in
Germany would be in particular the following:

- potentially no or limited court review and/or supervision of the restructuring proceedings;

- any measures (such as reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the
restructuring plan may be approved within a class of creditors (e.g., the holders of the Notes)
with a majority of 75% of the claims or by way of a so-called cross-class cram down by other
classes under certain presumptions;

- any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to
restructuring proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral;
and

- restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain creditors regarding their claims,
or, if applicable, their respective collateral over moveable assets of up to eight months due to a
moratorium.


-----

**_Restructuring proceedings_**

Restructuring proceedings may only be initiated by the relevant debtor with a notification of the
competent restructuring court of the commencement of restructuring proceedings. A debtor is eligible
to file for a restructuring plan to be sanctioned if it has become imminently illiquid (drohend
_zahlungsunfähig). Such imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) occurs if it is more_
likely than not that the debtor will be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due within a two
years’ look-forward period. Based on certain, but disputed case law, the respective debtor needs its
shareholders’ consent to file for restructuring proceedings.

During the restructuring proceedings, the debtor has to observe the duty of a prudent business
manager, which includes safeguarding the best interest of all of the debtor’s creditors. In particular,
the debtor has to refrain from any actions, which cannot be reconciled with or potentially frustrate the
restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel). This means that, generally, any claims, which shall be
subject to the envisaged restructuring plan, must not be settled or collateralized during the
restructuring proceedings.

During the restructuring proceedings, the duty to file for insolvency without undue delay if the debtor
becomes illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet) is generally suspended. However,
if such an insolvency event occurs, the debtor is obliged to notify the restructuring court accordingly
without undue delay. The restructuring court then abrogates the restructuring proceedings unless, in
the restructuring courts discretion, (i) the abrogation of the restructuring proceedings is, against the
backdrop of the advanced status of restructuring proceedings, evidently not in the interest of all
creditors or (ii) the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) is caused
by the enforcement of any such claim that is envisaged to be subject to the restructuring plan provided
the achievement of the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) remains predominantly likely. Once
restructuring proceedings have been abrogated by the restructuring court, the debtor is again obliged
to file for insolvency under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

If (i) the envisaged restructuring also comprises of consumer claims or claims of small or medium
enterprises or respective collateral granted for the benefit of such claims, (ii) the debtor has filed for a
moratorium against all or essentially all creditors or (iii) the envisaged restructuring plan provides for
specific supervision of the settlement of claims subject to the plan, the restructuring court has to
appoint a mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter). A (mandatory)
restructuring officer is also to be appointed by the restructuring court if the restructuring goal
(Restrukturierungsziel) can predictably only be achieved by a cram-down of dissenting classes (unless
only claims originated by financial institutions and/or shareholders are to be compromised).

The restructuring court may appoint as mandatory restructuring officer
(Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) any person with experience in restructurings and insolvencies who is
suitable for the respective individual case and who is qualified as a tax advisor, accountant, lawyer or
has comparable qualifications (an “Eligible Restructuring Officer”); the court may take suggestions
by the debtor, creditors or shareholders into account. If (i) the debtor is, based on expert opinion
provided by an Eligible Restructuring Officer, eligible for a moratorium (see —“Moratorium”), or
(ii) creditors of one class with at least 25% of the corresponding votes in such class propose an
Eligible Restructuring Officer, the court may only appoint a mandatory restructuring officer different
from the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer if the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer is
evidently inadequate. If a mandatory restructuring officer is appointed based on the proposal of the
debtor or a group of creditors, the restructuring court may appoint an additional mandatory
restructuring officer in its own discretion.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) is entitled to decide on the
procedure to be elected for the voting on the restructuring plan and can be empowered by the
restructuring court to (i) supervise the debtor’s board and business situation and (ii) receive payments
to and approve payments made by the debtor. If a moratorium is granted, the mandatory restructuring
officer is obliged to monitor that the respective prerequisites of such moratorium persist and, in case


-----

such prerequisites do not persist, entitled to file for a lifting of such moratorium. Additionally, the
mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to comment on the proposed plan’s prospects to remove the
debtor’s imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and restore the debtor’s viability.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has to perform its duties
independently and the debtor is obliged to share all relevant information with the mandatory
restructuring officer. The restructuring court can remove the mandatory restructuring officer from
office for good cause _ex_ _officio_ or, if the mandatory restructuring officer
(Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition.

Furthermore, the debtor or at least 25% of creditors in a voting class, can request the appointment of
an optional restructuring officer to facilitate the development and negotiation of a restructuring plan.
Creditors may only request such appointment if they agree to be jointly and severally liable for the
costs of the optional restructuring officer. The optional restructuring officer is only obliged to support
the stakeholders involved in the negotiations of the restructuring plan, but has no further powers. An
optional restructuring officer can also be removed from office by the restructuring court ex officio for
good cause or, if the optional restructuring officer has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a
creditor’s petition.

Prior to a confirmation and implementation of a restructuring plan, the restructuring court may
terminate the restructuring proceedings for certain reasons, e.g. if the debtor notifies the restructuring
court of the occurrence of an insolvency event unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion (taking
into account the actual status of the relevant restructuring proceedings), the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings is obviously not in the interest of the entirety of the creditors or if the debtor
files for insolvency or insolvency proceedings are opened over the assets of the debtor based on a
creditor’s filing.

**_Restructuring plan_**

Key element of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan, which can comprise certain
selected or all (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on
intentionally committed acts of tort) of the debtor’s liabilities, or amend the terms of financial and
other agreements to which more than the debtor and one other party are parties, including the terms of
the relevant Guarantee and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Any form of financial or operational debt may be compromised, including contingent claims and
undue claims, and relating contractual arrangements including syndicated credit facilities and
intercreditor agreements can be amended by virtue of the plan. Corresponding collateral provided by
debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten) may also be released and/or granted under a
restructuring plan, provided that affected creditors are adequately compensated. Consequently, the
Notes or the Guarantees could also be subject to a restructuring plan provided the respective debtor
has its “center of main interest” in Germany.

Further, a restructuring plan may provide for a (partial) debt-to-equity swap or other corporate law
measures like a share-capital increase. Debt-to-equity swaps can be implemented without the
shareholders’ consent but require the willingness of at least certain creditors to equitize their debt
claims as no creditor can be forced to take equity as a consideration under a restructuring plan. Hence,
if the Guarantees were subject to a restructuring plan providing for debt-to-equity swap, single holders
of the Notes could not be forced under the restructuring plan to take equity in a German Guarantor
without their respective consent.

The restructuring plan will be voted on by creditors of the debtor and must subsequently be confirmed
by the restructuring court. The vote may take place by way of consent solicitation process or in a
(virtual) creditors’ meeting. Creditors will be divided into classes determined on the basis of the
respective creditors’ economic interests in the debtor. As a minimum distinction, secured creditors,
unsecured creditors, creditors that benefit from intra-group credit support and subordinated creditors
(e.g. shareholders) will form separate classes. However, also other factors like, e.g., cross-holdings,


-----

could be taken into account for class composition. 75% by value of all claims of one class will be
required to approve the plan for such class. There is no numerosity requirement. Dissenting classes
can be crammed down (or up), if:

- the class members can be expected to be no worse off under the plan than absent the plan
(whereby the alternative scenario must not necessarily be an in-court insolvent liquidation, but
can also be an alternative out-of-court restructuring on a going concern basis);

- the crammed down (or up) class members receive an adequate share in the economic value
created by the plan; and

- a majority of classes has accepted the plan.

A crammed down (or up) class receives an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan if
(i) no other creditor receives more than its claim’s par value, (ii) no creditors that would rank junior in
insolvency proceedings, the debtor or its shareholders receive any value through the plan which is not
covered by a respective stakeholder’s contribution to the plan and (iii) no creditor that would rank
_pari passu in insolvency proceedings receives a preferential treatment compared to the dissenting_
class under the restructuring plan (unless such preferential treatment is appropriate (sachgerecht) in
light of the individual situation of distress to overcome and the dissenting class accounts for no more
than 50% of the rank’s total claims). However, despite the prerequisite described under (ii) in the
foregoing sentence, a creditor class can also be crammed down in case a shareholder retains equity
without any additional contribution if the shareholder itself is crucial for and bindingly committed to
the continuation of the debtor’s business and the realization of the restructuring plan or the creditors’
rights are only compromised marginally (e.g. by a maturity extension of no more than 18 months).

Upon the debtor’s decision, either the debtor or the restructuring court can lead the voting on the plan.
In case the voting has been led by the debtor, the restructuring court has to hold a hearing of affected
stakeholders before the plan can be confirmed.

The restructuring court will confirm the plan unless (i) the debtor is not (longer) imminently illiquid
(drohend zahlungsunfähig), (ii) there is a material breach of statutory provisions regarding the
procedure to adopt the restructuring plan or its permitted content that cannot or has not been cured
upon the restructuring court’s notice, (iii) claims contemplated by or surviving the restructuring plan
can obviously be not satisfied by the debtor or (iv), if new money financing is contemplated under the
restructuring plan, the underlying restructuring concept is incoherent or appears to be based on
incorrect facts or to have no reasonable prospect of success. Additionally, dissenting creditors can
request the restructuring court to reject the restructuring plan if the applicant will be expectedly worse
off under the restructuring plan than without the proposed restructuring plan and the applicant has
already raised such concern in the creditors’ meeting or creditors’ hearing, as applicable. However,
such application has no merits if the restructuring plan provides for funds to be distributed to creditors
that can prove to be worse-off, irrespective of whether any such applicant actually benefits from such
funds.

Dissenting creditors can appeal against the restructuring court’s confirmation order of the plan if they
are able to produce prima facie evidence (glaubhaft machen) that they are worse-off under the
restructuring plan and funds provided thereunder to compensate worse-off creditors (if any) will not
suffice for their individual compensation. Such appeal will only have suspensive effect
(aufschiebende Wirkung) against the effectiveness of the restructuring plan if requested by the
dissenting creditor and ordered by the court based on serious and irreversible disadvantages for such
dissenting creditor that are not in proportion to the benefits of an immediate implementation of the
restructuring plan.

Restructuring plans, which are negotiated and approved in public proceedings and confirmed by a
German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency
Proceedings Regulation upon the restructuring proceedings being included as a recognized proceeding


-----

in Exhibit A of the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the
restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.
As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January
1, 2021, any such recognition has not yet been tested as of the date of this offering memorandum.

**_Moratorium_**

In order for the debtor to be able to draw up and negotiate the restructuring plan, the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) offers the possibility of having a moratorium ordered
by the competent court upon application by the debtor, which can restrict enforcement measures by
certain or all creditors with regards to their payment claims or the realization of respective collateral
over moveable assets. The moratorium can initially be ordered for a maximum period of up to three
months, with subsequent orders to extend the moratorium up to a maximum of eight months
permissible under certain conditions. Such moratorium may also be sanctioned with regards to
collateral provided by the debtor’s affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten).

The moratorium does not suspend the relevant creditor’s interest claims. However, whereas creditors
may still file an insolvency petition against the debtor during a moratorium, correspondingly initiated
insolvency proceedings are suspended for the time of the moratorium. Under certain conditions, in
particular if the requirements to terminate restructuring proceedings are met or the debtor does not
comply with certain statutory duties under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act
(StaRUG) the competent court may lift the moratorium, also on a creditor’s application.

**_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests_**

The German Guarantors are incorporated and established in Germany in the form of a limited liability
company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbH”). Consequently, the Guarantees and
security interests granted by the German Guarantors are subject to certain provisions of the German
Limited Liability Companies Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung—
“GmbHG”). These provisions would also apply to any future Guarantor in the form of a GmbH, or in
case of a private limited partnership with a limited liability company as general partner
(Kommanditgesellschaft) (“GmbH & Co. KG”) to its general partner.

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s
net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves as determined under German generally
accepted accounting principles) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share
capital (Stammkapital); in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, such provisions apply to the general partner
which is a GmbH. The granting or enforcement of guarantees and/or security interests by a GmbH or
by a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister
company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable a
GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG to issue guarantees or grant security interests to secure liabilities of a
direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is
standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to
contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or partnership
with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such
limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees and security interests agree, subject to certain
exemptions, to enforce the guarantees and security interests against the German subsidiary only to the
extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a partnership with a GmbH
as unlimited liable partner, such GmbH’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the
case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such
amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Guarantees and security interests provided by a
German Guarantor to secure the Notes will contain such limitation language and therefore the
enforcement of the Guarantees and the security interests securing the Notes is limited in the manner
described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security interest granted
by a German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.


-----

The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG to be incorporated into the relevant Notes
documents, in particular in the Indenture, will substantially be in the form as follows (with a
corresponding form to be included in the relevant security documents):

- The restrictions in the guarantee clause of the Indenture shall apply to any guarantee, indemnity,
liability and other payment obligations under the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to
limitations for a German GmbH or KG or any other provision in the Indenture and/or any other
documents in connection therewith granted by any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of
Germany as a limited liability company (GmbH) (a “German GmbH Guarantor”) to secure
liabilities of its current or any future direct or indirect shareholder(s) (upstream) or a Subsidiary
of such shareholder (but excluding any direct or in-direct Subsidiary of such Guarantor) (crossstream).

- The restrictions in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German
GmbH or KG shall not apply with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below):

(i) to the extent the German GmbH Guarantor secures any indebtedness under the
Indenture in respect of (i) loans to the extent such loans are (directly or indirectly) onlent or otherwise passed on to the relevant German GmbH Guarantor or its
Subsidiaries or (ii) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the benefit of
any of the creditors of the German GmbH Guarantor or the German GmbH
Guarantor’s Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent that any such on-lending or
otherwise passing on or bank guarantees or letters of credit are still outstanding at the
time of the enforcement of the guarantee; for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
paragraph (b) shall have the effect that such on-lent amounts may be enforced
multiple times (no double dip);

(ii) if, at the time of enforcement of the guarantee, a domination and/or profit and loss
pooling agreement (Beherrschungs—und/oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) as per
Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG) (either directly
or indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer
agreements) exists between the relevant German GmbH Guarantor as a dominated
company, and:

(A) that German GmbH Guarantor is a Subsidiary of the relevant obligor whose
obligations are secured by the relevant guarantee, that guarantee; or

(B) the German GmbH Guarantor and the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are
secured by the relevant guarantee are both Subsidiaries of a joint (direct or
indirect) parent company and such parent company as dominating entity
(beherrschendes Unternehmen),

to the extent the existence of such domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement
(Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) leads to the inapplicability of
section 30 paragraph 1 sentence 1 of the German Limited Liabilities Company Act
(Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbHG);

(iii) to the extent any payment under the guarantee demanded from a German GmbH
Guarantor is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or
recourse claim (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs—oder Rückgewähranspruch) of the German
GmbH Guarantor against the affiliate whose obligations are secured by the relevant
guarantee; or

(iv) if the relevant German GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant to
paragraphs (d) and (e) below. However, if and to the extent that the guarantee has been
enforced without regard to the restrictions contained in the guarantee clause of the
Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or KG because the Management
Notification and/or the Auditor’s Determination (each as defined below) has not (or not in


-----

a timely manner) been delivered pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, but the
Auditor’s Determination has then been delivered within four months from its due date in
accordance with paragraph (e) below, the Trustee shall upon demand of the German
GmbH Guarantor repay any amount received from the German GmbH Guarantor which
pursuant to the Auditor’s Determination would not have been available for enforcement, if
the Auditor’s Determination had been delivered in a timely manner.

- The parties to the Indenture agree that if and to the extent the payment under the guarantee
would cause (i) the amount of a German GmbH Guarantor’s Net Assets (as defined below), as
calculated and defined pursuant to paragraph (h) below, to fall below the amount required to
maintain its registered share capital (Stammkapital) or increase an existing shortage (Vertiefung
_einer Unterbilanz) of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) and thereby violating sections_
30, 31 GmbHG (such event, a “Capital Impairment”), or (ii) a German GmbH Guarantor to be
deprived of the liquidity necessary to fulfil its liabilities towards its creditors and thereby
violating Section 64 sentence 3 GmbHG (such event, a “Liquidity Impairment”) then the
Trustee shall not enforce and the German GmbH Guarantor shall, subject to paragraphs (d) and
(e) below, have a defence (Einrede) against any claim under the guarantee if and to the extent
such Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur.

- If the relevant German GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee in (the “Management
Notification”) within 20 business days after the making of a demand against that German GmbH
Guarantor under the guarantee:

(i) to what extent such guarantee is an upstream or cross-stream guarantee or indemnity; and

(ii) to what extent a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur as a result of an
enforcement of the guarantee (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its Net Assets
or to which extent the liquidity would be deprived, providing an up-to-date _pro forma_
balance sheet or liquidity statement),

then the restrictions set out in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for
a German GmbH or KG shall cease to apply until a Management Notification has been
provided.

- If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) business
days of its receipt, request the relevant German GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee
within forty-five (45) business days of receipt of such request a determination by the Auditors or
any other auditors of inter- national standard and reputation (the “Auditor’s Determination”)
appointed by the German GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense) setting out in
reasonable detail the amount in which the payment under the guarantee would cause a Capital
Impairment or Liquidity Impairment, subject to the terms set out under the guarantee clause of
the Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or KG. The Auditor’s Determination
shall be binding on all parties.

- The net assets (Reinvermögen) of the German GmbH Guarantor (the “Net Assets”) shall be
calculated in accordance with section 42 GmbHG and sections 242, 264 of the German
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and the generally accepted accounting principles
applicable from time to time in Germany (Grundsätze ordnungsgemäßer Buchführung) and for
the purposes of calculating the Net Assets, the following balance sheet items shall be adjusted as
follows:

(i) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant German GmbH
Guarantor which was carried out after the relevant German GmbH Guarantor became a
party to the Indenture and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus
_Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be deducted from the amount of the registered share capital_


-----

(Stammkapital) of the relevant German GmbH Guarantor if it is expressly prohibited under
the Indenture and has been carried out without the prior written consent of the Trustee;

(ii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to section 253 sub-section 6 HGB shall not
be included in the calculation of Net Assets;

(iii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to section 268 sub-section 8 HGB shall not
be included in the calculation of Net Assets;

(iv) the amount of non-distributable assets according to section 272 sub-section 5 HGB shall not
be included in the calculation of Net Assets; and

(v) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant German GmbH Guarantor in willful or
grossly negligent violation of the Indenture shall not be taken into account as liabilities.

- Where a German GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of the guarantee
clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or KG that the guarantee can
only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall realize, to the extent lawful and commercially
justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with a book value
(Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets and are not necessary
(betriebsnotwendig) for the relevant German GmbH Guarantor’s business.

- Nothing in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or
KG shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under the Indenture to the Trustee or
vice versa.

- Nothing in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German GmbH or
KG shall prevent the Trustee or a German GmbH Guarantor from claiming in court that the
provision of this guarantee and/or making payments under this guarantee by the German GmbH
Guarantor does or does not fall within the scope of sections 30, 31 of the GmbHG, section 15(b)
(5) of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung – InsO) and/or section 826 BGB.

- In addition to the restrictions set out in the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to
limitations for a German GmbH or KG, if a German GmbH Guarantor demonstrates that,
according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or a
higher regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the enforcement of any upstream or crossstream guarantee or security interest against such German GmbH Guarantor would result in
personal liability of its managing director(s) (Geschäftsführer) for a reimbursement of payments
made under the guarantee (including pursuant to section 826 BGB), the German GmbH
Guarantor shall have a defence (Einrede) against the guarantee to the extent required in order
not to incur such liability.

- The provisions set out in the guarantee clause of the Indenture shall apply to a limited
partnership with a limited liability company as its general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) _mutatis_
_mutandis and all references to a Capital Impairment, Liquidity Impairment and Net Assets shall_
be construed as a reference to the Capital Impairment, Liquidity Impairment and Net Assets of
the general partner (Komplementär) of the German GmbH Guarantor.

- For the purposes of the guarantee clause of the Indenture relating to limitations for a German
GmbH or KG, a reference to a “German GmbH Guarantor” includes any limited liability
company incorporated (or limited partnership with a limited liability company as its general
partner) in a jurisdiction other than Germany whose center of main interest (as that term is used
in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of 20 May 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings) is
in Germany.

- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, the guarantee clause of the Indenture
relating to limitations for a German GmbH or KG and any rights and/or obligations arising out
of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, German law.


-----

In addition to the limitations resulting from the capital maintenance rules under Sections 30 and 31,
the guarantees and security interests granted by the German Guarantor contain additional provisions
limiting the enforcement in the event that the enforcement would result in an illiquidity of the
German Guarantor in case such illiquidity triggers liability risks for management.

German capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules (including with respect to Sections 30,
31 GmbHG and Section 15(b) InsO), are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that
future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries
constituted in the form of, as applicable, a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect
the ability of the German Guarantors to make payments on the Notes or the Guarantees or the
enforceability of the Guarantees, the Indenture and the security interests provided by the German
Guarantors.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a
situation in which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of assets or the liquidity necessary for it to meet
its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a
guarantee or security interest granted by a German Guarantor. In such a case, the amount of
proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover,
according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security
agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about
the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to
grant security by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out
that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the guarantees or
security interests by the German Guarantor.

The enforcement of security granted by a German Guarantor may also be excluded (entirely) in
case the granting or enforcement of such security and/or the filing for insolvency as a consequence
of a claim by any so secured finance party under such security resulted or would result in any
personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to Section 15(b)
InsO.

Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the stated share capital of
a GmbH (e.g., the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest granted by such GmbH or GmbH
& Co. KG) could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the
creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors
of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of _bonos mores_ (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention
could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that
the grantor of the guarantee or security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason
to enquire further with respect thereto.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a
debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the
debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending)
insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The
German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example,
the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other
creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such
intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances
indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse
(Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.


-----

**_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_**

Under German law, “certain accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that
the pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security
interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet)
hold the secured claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or
novated, and may not be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they
secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of interests in the Notes from time
to time will not be party to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from
time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the
Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the creation of
the parallel debt, the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal to each
amount payable by each obligor under, in particular, the Notes and the Guarantees. The pledges
governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure
the parallel debt rather than the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The
validity of the parallel debt concept and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such
parallel debt has not been tested under German law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or
mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law. Therefore, the ability of the Security
Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk
associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires
the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to
which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear
whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other
creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset
constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give
their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the
realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request
the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

**Denmark**

Certain of the Guarantors are entities incorporated under the laws Denmark. Any insolvency
proceedings with respect to a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Denmark would be based on
Danish insolvency laws. Please note that the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply to Denmark. It
should be noted that the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and
on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and
discharge of debt (the “Restructuring Directive”), applies in Denmark and was implemented into
Danish national law and became effective as of 17 July 2022. The changes to the Danish Insolvency
Act (konkursloven) following from the implementation of the Restructuring Directive include, inter
_alios, a new ability for a debtor to petition a so-called pre-emptive in-court restructuring_
(forebyggende rekonstruktionsbehandling) prior to such debtor becoming insolvent. Danish
insolvency laws may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as the laws of the United States or
other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that a Danish Guarantor experiences
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar
proceedings. There are two kinds of Danish in-court insolvency proceedings; bankruptcy and in-court
restructuring (including pre-emptive restructurings).

**_Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of a debtor or a creditor, however
provided that the debtor is insolvent, which pursuant to the Danish Insolvency Act is defined as the


-----

debtor’s inability to pay his debts as they fall due, unless such inability is considered to be temporary.
The petition for bankruptcy must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor
operates his business. The bankruptcy court does not publish information on the receipt of the petition
for bankruptcy, but any person having a legal interest is entitled to receive information as to whether
and when a debtor has filed a petition for bankruptcy (debtor’s own petition). The bankruptcy court
does not provide information on a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy. A creditor cannot demand that
the debtor be declared bankrupt if the creditor’s claim is secured by adequate security. In this context,
adequate security means a security right expected to provide full coverage for the creditor. If the
security is voidable in bankruptcy or the act of perfection has not been performed, the creditor does
not have adequate security.

The creditor is not required to have a basis of execution for his claim, e.g., a judgment in a civil case,
a settlement in-court or a signed debt instrument or mortgage. Further, the creditor’s claim does not
have to be due for payment to form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. However, the creditor must
have a legal interest in the debtor’s estate being administered in bankruptcy. As a result, not all claims
that have not become due for payment may form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. Depending on the
circumstances, an overdraft facility still being in force or a repayment arrangement being observed by
the debtor may result in the creditor’s petition being rejected. The requirement for legal interest also
means that in general the bankruptcy court will reject a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy if it is clear
in advance that he will not receive any dividend in case of bankruptcy. It should be noted, however,
that if there is probable cause to believe that the debtor has made avoidable transactions, the creditor
may have the required legal interest in the bankruptcy even if the debtor does not have substantial
assets. In that case, the creditor must be able to substantiate the avoidable transactions with some
degree of certainty.

A creditor having filed a petition for bankruptcy against a debtor will be liable to pay damages if the
debtor suffers a loss or to pay compensation for injury to the debtor’s reputation if the bankruptcy
conditions, the insolvency requirement, are not fulfilled or if the claim does not exist. The petitioner
must provide security for the expenses relating to the administration of the estate. In practice, the
bankruptcy court demands security in the amount of Danish Kroner 30,000 (Danish Kroner 40,000 if
subject to the jurisdiction of the Commercial and Maritime Court). If the debtor has filed the petition
for bankruptcy, the security must be provided by the funds of the bankruptcy estate or a third party.

**_Bankruptcy Trustee_**

One or more trustees are appointed at the discretion of the bankruptcy court; however, in practice the
request of the major unsecured and unsubordinated creditors have the decisive influence as another
trustee can be appointed at a creditor’s meeting, provided dividend is expected to be distributed by the
debtor’s estate to the unsecured creditors. The trustee is not required to be a qualified attorney-at-law,
but in practice that is generally always the case.

The trustee must comply with the disqualification rules of the Danish Insolvency Act. Consequently,
the trustee must not be the debtor’s related party or depending on the debtor, and there must not be
any doubt as to whether the trustee is impartial. As a general rule, the debtor’s own attorney is
prevented from being appointed as trustee due to the disqualification rules. The bankruptcy court may
also find that a person being a member of the board of directors of the debtor’s business or a person
being the debtor’s advisor cannot be appointed as trustee. Likewise, any person whom the bankruptcy
estate is expected to make claims against, e.g., an avoidance claim or otherwise, will most likely be
deemed to have a personal interest in the administration of the estate and would therefore not meet
these requirements. The trustee will make all decisions concerning the administration of the
bankruptcy estate, and he represents the estate in every respect. The bankruptcy court supervises the
trustee but is not involved in the actual administration of the estate, unless the circumstances require
that the bankruptcy court interfere.

**_In-Court Restructuring_**


-----

In-court restructuring proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of the debtor or a creditor.
The petition for in-court restructuring must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which
the debtor operates his business. In-court restructuring proceedings (as opposed to in-court preemptive restructuring proceedings) may only be commenced if the debtor is insolvent (same as
described above with respect to bankruptcy). If this criterion is fulfilled, the bankruptcy court will
immediately appoint a restructuring administrator and (if requested) a restructuring accountant to
oversee the restructuring of the company. The management continues to operate the company, but any
material transactions may not be carried out without the prior approval of the restructuring
administrator. An automatic prohibition of individual enforcement action applies
(fyldestgørelsesforbud) with certain exceptions regarding secured assets. Payment of creditors may
only be done in accordance with the priority of claims as described below.

The in-court restructuring of a company must achieve one or more of the following statutory
objectives: (i) the in-court restructuring of the business by means of a compulsory composition; (ii)
the termination of the business of the company by transferring the business in part or in full; (iii) any
other initiative(s) taken for the purpose of ending the debtor’s insolvency (such as conversion of debt
or supply of additional equity) or (iv) any combination of (i), (ii) and (iii). The aim of a restructuring
is therefore to salvage the business itself, but not necessarily thereby saving the company.

The restructuring administrator will propose a restructuring plan stating the actual statutory objective,
and creditors with a legal interest who attend the voting meeting at the court can vote for or against
the proposed restructuring plan. If the in-court restructuring does not contain at least one of these
required elements, the in-court restructuring will automatically seize and, provided the company is
still insolvent, bankruptcy proceedings shall be initiated. It is possible to withdraw unsuccessful
restructuring proceedings without bankruptcy proceedings being commenced, provided that the
withdrawal shall occur prior to the date of the meeting, during which the restructuring proposal is to
be presented (i.e., within four weeks of the commencement of the restructuring proceedings).
Following the withdrawal of unsuccessful restructuring proceedings, it will not be possible to file for
new restructuring proceedings until one month after the withdrawal.

Furthermore, it is possible to complete an in-court restructuring by way of a so-called “fast track
procedure”. This process entails that a business transfer may take place without the adoption of a
restructuring plan if deemed expedient for preserving the value of the company. The restructuring
administrator is required to consent to the transfer. The creditors are granted five days to object to the
transfer and, if a majority of the creditors entitled to vote does not vote against the transfer, it may be
executed.

**_In-court Pre-emptive Restructuring_**

Following the implementation into Danish law of the Restructuring Directive, the Danish Insolvency
Act now also allows for in-court pre-emptive restructuring proceedings, which can commence prior to
a debtor becoming insolvent. In-court pre-emptive restructuring proceedings may only be commenced
by the debtor himself (as opposed to the general in-court restructuring proceedings) and does not
require that the debtor is insolvent at the time of the petition. Instead, the criterion for the petitioning
of a pre-emptive restructuring is that the debtor in its own judgment is likely to become insolvent due
to existing financial difficulties of the debtor. Any petition for an in-court pre-emptive restructuring
does not take precedent over a creditor's petitioning of an in-court restructuring or bankruptcy
proceedings (save that such proceedings can only successfully be petitioned if the debtor is in fact
insolvent). However, the court may on a case-by-case basis decide to postpone such creditor's petition
for an in-court restructuring or bankruptcy proceedings.

The petition for in-court pre-emptive restructuring must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the
district in which the debtor operates his business. Equivalent to the rules governing the general incourt restructurings, the management of the debtor continues to operate the company. As opposed to


-----

the general in-court restructuring regime, a pre-emptive restructuring does not result in an automatic
prohibition against the taking of enforcement action against the debtor or its assets. Instead, such
prohibition will only be effective if the debtor requests the court to grant such prohibition and is
conditional upon the appointment of a restructuring administrator similar to the process for general incourt restructuring process. If a restructuring administrator is appointed, any material transactions
may not be carried out without the prior approval of the restructuring administrator.

In addition, the prohibition against taking enforcement action against the debtor does not affect any
existing and duly registered floating charges (virksomhedspant) and such floating charges do not
crystalize upon the commencement of a pre-emptive restructuring and the debtor is therefore able to
dispose of the assets subject to the floating charge in the ordinary course of business (udskillelse
_ifølge regelmæssig drift). The in-court pre-emptive restructuring of a company must achieve one or_
more of the same statutory objectives as required for the general in-court restructurings. It is possible
to withdraw unsuccessful restructuring proceedings without bankruptcy proceedings being
commenced, provided that withdrawal shall occur prior to the date of the meeting, during which the
restructuring proposal is to be presented (i.e. within four weeks of the commencement of the
restructuring proceedings). Following the withdrawal of unsuccessful restructuring proceedings, it
will not be possible to file for a new restructuring until one month after the withdrawal.

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of the company are realized
and distributed by the liquidator to the creditors and, providing all creditors have been paid in full, the
shareholders. In Denmark, liquidation is not an insolvency proceeding, and only companies that are
solvent can be liquidated. If a company is insolvent, or if it turns out during the liquidation process
that the company cannot pay all its creditors in full, the company must enter bankruptcy proceedings
instead. The decision to liquidate a company is made by the shareholders of the company at a general
meeting who also appoint a liquidator. At the end of the liquidation process the company will be
dissolved.

**_Certain Avoidance Rules and Hardening Periods_**

Under the Danish Insolvency Act, the bankruptcy estate is entitled to under certain circumstances to
avoid the debtor’s transactions in a reference period preceding the bankruptcy if such transactions
have reduced the assets of the estate or otherwise damaged the estate, or if the transactions have
favored certain creditors without observing the ranking of the creditors.

Transactions damaging the estate are for example gifts (including sale of assets at undervalue),
renunciations of inheritance or the payment of excessive salary or pension to related parties.
Transactions favoring creditors without observing the ranking of creditors are for example payment
by unusual means of payment, payments before due date, payments having significantly impaired the
debtor’s ability to pay or the provision of security for prior debts. Special attention is given to the
avoidance rule on security for prior debts and the general avoidance rule in the following paragraphs.
Any security interest created and perfected within a three-month reference period prior to the
bankruptcy and which has not been created prior to, or simultaneously with, the debt obligations
which it secures, or which is not perfected without undue delay after the creation of such debt
obligations may be subject to an avoidance claim from the estate.

Danish insolvency law operates with a general avoidance rule, which stipulates that an action which
unduly benefits a single creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or whereby the company’s
assets are prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the company’s
debt is increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be declared void if the company was or
because of the action became insolvent, and the benefitted party knew or ought to have known about
the company’s insolvency and the circumstances that made the action improper. Generally, only
transactions which are contrary to common norms of correct and decent business behavior will be


-----

deemed improper. Improper behavior is normally related to a breach of the purpose of insolvency
proceedings, which typically is the situation where a creditor should have realized that a given
transaction would deprive the other creditors of their right to fulfilment of their claims. The usual
reference period is three months prior to the filing date, which is extended to up to 24 months for
transactions with parties closely related to the company, and the general avoidance rule provides for a
theoretically unlimited avoidance period with respect to improper transactions. The requirement that
the company must have been in an uninterrupted insolvent state throughout the entire period does,
however, limit the practical length of the reference period.

**_Legal Position of Unsecured Claims and Priority of Claims_**

Creditors believing to have a claim against the debtor or the bankruptcy estate must prove their claims
and accompany their proofs of claim by adequate documentation. The trustee registers all claims and
examines whether they are legitimate and entitle the creditor to receive dividend. The ranking of
creditors is described in the Danish Insolvency Act which determines the order in which claims
against the estate or the debtor are settled. All higher-ranking claims must be satisfied in full before
the next level will be entitled to dividend, i.e., a waterfall scheme. The ranking of creditors is as
follows:

- _Firstly: costs or claims incurred in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings or claims_
according to agreements upheld by the estate;

- _Secondly: reasonable claims in connection with any prior attempted restructuring proceedings;_

- _Thirdly: claims for wages or salaries payable;_

- _Fourthly: claims of suppliers for certain indirect taxes;_

- _Fifthly: unsecured claims (all other claims except for deferred claims); and_

- _Sixthly: deferred claims (interest, fines, promises of gifts and subordinate loan capital)._

Secured claims are handled separately from the waterfall and the secured claim is paid using the
proceeds from the collateral that secures the claim. If the secured claim is not covered by the
proceeds, the outstanding part of the secured claim will generally be considered as a regular
unsecured claim in the waterfall. The handling of secured claims will in each case depend on the type
of security.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The Danish Companies Act contains restrictions on financial assistance by Danish limited liability
companies. Danish companies and their foreign subsidiaries can, directly or indirectly, advance funds,
grant loans or provide guarantee and/or security in respect of obligations of amongst others, their
direct and indirect parent companies. If the relevant shareholder is not a limited liability company
incorporated in a jurisdiction which is a member of the EU or European Economic Area or
Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Chile, Great Britain, Japan, Northern Ireland, Israel, South Korea,
New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan or U.S., then the following special requirements apply to such
financial assistance: (i) the financial assistance is within the distributable reserves and made on
ordinary market terms (on an arm’s-length basis), (ii) the financial assistance must be approved by the
shareholders/at a shareholders meeting and cannot exceed such approved amount and (iii) the
financial assistance can only be made after the first annual account.

Notwithstanding the above, as a general rule, Danish companies and their foreign subsidiaries are
prohibited from granting loans and or guarantees or security in connection with the financing or
refinancing of the direct or indirect acquisition of, or subscription for, their own shares or shares in


-----

their direct or indirect parent companies and any such loan, guarantee or security will be invalid and
unenforceable. Such financial assistance is only permitted in accordance with certain preconditions
and requirements, which include obtaining a credit rating on the recipient of the financial assistance, a
report (to be publicized) by the central management body (including providing the reason behind the
financial assistance, company’s interest, conditions of the transaction, assessment of consequences
and price for the shares to be paid by the buyer), a resolution by the general meeting approving the
financial assistance. The financial assistance must be within the distributable reserves and made on
ordinary market terms (on an arm’s-length basis).

**_Corporate Benefit_**

It is a requirement under Danish law that a guarantor or security provider obtains an adequate
corporate benefit from the issuance of a guarantee or the granting of security. This is due to a
requirement under Danish law that the management of a company must always ensure a proper
management of the company’s assets. Further, the management board and the board of directors of the
company is obliged to act in accordance with the company’s individual interests, including
consideration of the company’s financial position, the benefits the company will obtain through and
the risks related to the granting of security, assessment of the debtor, securing that the arrangement is
on market terms, etc. If such benefit is not obtained, among others, the guarantee or security interest
may be null and void. It is not clear under Danish case law to what extent such corporate benefit is
established when a subsidiary guarantees and/or secures debt of a direct or indirect parent company.

**_Contractual Limitations of Guarantees Granted by Guarantors Incorporated in Denmark_**

To mitigate the above-mentioned financial assistance and corporate benefit issues, a guarantee granted
by a Danish guarantor (and any subsidiary of a Danish guarantor to the extent liable) will be limited if
and to the extent required to comply with Danish statutory provisions on unlawful financial assistance
and non-permitted shareholder loans including, without limitation, Sections 206 through 212 of the
Danish Companies Act. In addition, a guarantee granted by a Danish guarantor may further be limited
to a maximum amount equivalent to the higher of the equity (egenkapital) of such guarantor
(calculated in accordance with the approved accounting principles) at the time of the granting of the
guarantee, or at the time payment is requested pursuant to the guarantee. Consequently, any
guarantees and security interests provided by any Danish Guarantor will be subject to restrictions and
limitations, which may limit the value of a Guarantee issued by such Danish Guarantor and security
interest to avoid a breach of the corporate benefit requirement and to ensure compliance with
applicable restrictions on financial assistance.

The above contractual limitations will apply _mutatis mutandis to any subordination of rights and_
claims, subordination or turn-over of rights of recourse, application of proceeds, set-offs and any other
mean of direct or indirect financial assistance made by a Danish guarantor or any of its subsidiaries.

**_Ownership_**

Danish law does not make any distinction between registered and beneficial ownership and if such
distinction is made under foreign law the beneficial owner will be deemed the owner under Danish
law.

**_Statutes of Limitation_**

Claims may become barred under Danish statutes of limitation or principles of passivity or may
become subject to set-off or counterclaim and a guarantee in favor of a Danish credit institution may
not be enforceable unless a claim has been made under the guarantee within six months after the due
date of the guaranteed obligation.

**_Foreign Currency_**


-----

Under the Danish Insolvency Act, claims against the estate must be converted into Danish Kroner at
the exchange rate at the day the bankruptcy court issued a bankruptcy order against the company.

**_Enforcement of Security Interests Outside Bankruptcy_**

The parties to a security agreement can include contractually agreed enforcement procedures and, if
there are no bankruptcy proceedings, the agreed procedures will be binding on the parties. However, a
sale of assets may be voidable in a later bankruptcy proceeding if the assets were transferred below
market value or if the sale unduly benefits a creditor to the detriment of other creditors. The agreed
enforcement procedures are not binding on third parties such as creditors that have registered an
attachment or valid security against the encumbered assets. Such third-party attachments and rights
can only be cleared through a court administered public auction. In the absence of specifically agreed
enforcement procedures, Danish law requires conduct of a public auction in accordance with the
Danish Administration of Justice Act (retsplejeloven). Pledges of shares and accounts as well as
security assignments of receivables may be enforced without an execution order. However, at least
one week’s prior notice requesting the debtor to pay the secured debt must be given to the pledgor in
respect of share pledge and account pledge by registered mail unless a sale is necessary to avoid or
reduce a loss. The pre-enforcement notice period can be waived in respect of certain financial
collateral arrangements.

**_The Security Agent and the Trustee_**

The ability of the Security Agent to hold the relevant security interests over any Collateral on behalf
of holders of Notes pursuant to any security document governed by Danish law as well as the ability
of the Trustee to represent and act on behalf of holders of the Notes may require registration of the
Security Agent and the Trustee with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet). The
registration of the Security Agent as holder of Collateral with the Danish Financial Supervisory
Authority (Finanstilsynet) is, however, not a legal validity requirement for the granting and perfection
of collateral.

Under Danish law it is uncertain (i) whether the appointment of the Trustee and the Security Agent to
represent and act on behalf of the holders of Notes would be binding in the event of the bankruptcy of
a holder of Notes; (ii) whether the Trustee and the Security Agent have and will maintain the capacity
to bring proceedings and legal interest in the name or on behalf of the holders of Notes in the event of
bankruptcy a holder of Notes; (iii) whether the guarantees can be validly granted in favor of the
Security Agent as agent and representative on behalf of the holders of Notes; and (iv) whether the
holders of Notes can validly waive their rights to exercise their powers independently. As regards the
Notes, a Guarantee issued by a Danish Guarantor, the above concerns regarding the ability of the
Security Agent to hold a guarantee on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the ability of the Trustee
to represent and act on behalf of the holders of Notes can be addressed by registering the Security
Agent and the Trustee with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet) in accordance
with the rules set out in Chapter 4 of the Danish Capital Markets Act. No assurance is given that the
Security Agent, the Trustee or the Indenture and other documents meet the eligibility criteria for the
Security Agent and/or the Trustee to be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority
(Finanstilsynet), that such registration will be obtained or, if obtained, that it will be maintained.

**_Parallel Debt_**

There is no established concept of “trust,” “trustee” or “parallel debt” under Danish law and as such
these concepts may not be recognized or enforced by Danish courts. Danish law does not make any
distinction between registered and beneficial ownership and if such distinction is made under foreign
law the beneficial owner will be deemed the owner under Danish law.

made by your purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, you shall promptly notify us and the
Initial Purchasers. If you are acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor
accounts, you represent that you have sole investment discretion with respect to each such
investor account and that you have full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements,
representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

###### PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION 

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers have entered into a purchase agreement dated on
or around the date of this offering memorandum with respect to the Notes (the “Purchase
Agreement”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell
to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire
principal amount of the Notes.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the
Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the Notes if any are
purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes which it has
agreed to purchase, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other
Initial Purchasers may be increased or that the purchase agreement may be terminated.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they propose to offer the Notes initially at the offering
price listed on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial
Purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms of the Notes at any time without
notice. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to
reject orders in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of
their affiliates or through registered broker-dealers. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not
a U.S. registered broker-dealer intends to effect any sales of Notes in the United States, it will do so
through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated
by the applicable U.S. law.

In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that:

- the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject
to, among others, the delivery of certain opinions by their counsel;

- during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date
that is 30 days after such date, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries
or other affiliates will, without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft,
Deutsche Bank Securities, BNP Paribas, Inc., Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment
Bank, Natixis and Société Générale, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of or
announce an intention to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as
provided hereunder, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of its
subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes (other than the Notes); and

- the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act,
and/or will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates
may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers
certain customary fees for their services in connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for
certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Each purchaser of the Notes offered by this offering memorandum, in making its purchase, will be
deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Notice
_to Investors.” The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the_
Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States unless the Notes are registered


-----

under the Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is
available. Accordingly, each of the Initial Purchasers, severally and not jointly, has agreed that it will
not offer or sell the Notes and the Guarantees except (i) to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in
Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (ii) to non-U.S. persons purchasing
the securities outside the United States in offshore transactions (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance
on Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In addition, until the expiration of 40 days after the commencement of this Offering, an offer or sale
of Notes within the United States by a broker-dealer (whether or not participating in this Offering)
may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise
than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from
registration under the Securities Act. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale or
transfer of the Notes, see “Notice to Investors.” During this 40-day period, neither DTC, Clearstream
nor Euroclear will monitor compliance by dealers with Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act.

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. Application will be made
to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange. There can be no assurance, however, that the Notes will be listed on the Exchange or that
such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to
make a market in the Notes after completion of this Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are
under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without
notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the
Notes will develop, or that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes
at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you, if at all.

In connection with this Offering, the relevant Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on its behalf)
may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment,
stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves
sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers.
Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of
pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate-covering transactions involve
purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a
broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by such broker-dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or
covering transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be effected in the over-thecounter market or otherwise.

These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result,
the price of the Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In
addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilizing Managers to engage in such transactions and neither
we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Managers will engage in
these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without
notice. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of
the terms of this Offering is made and, if begun, may be discontinued at any time, but it must end no
later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the
Notes. Any stabilization action or over-allotment must be conducted by the relevant Stabilizing
Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the        business day
following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+       ”).
Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.


-----

Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next
business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+      , to
specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should
consult their advisors.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:

- it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom; and

- it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or
the Guarantors.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by
any of the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to
us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes
may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other
offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in
or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of
any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a
solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be
unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform
themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this
offering memorandum and resale of Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of
the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and
may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services to
the Issuer and its affiliates for which they have received or may receive customary fees and
commissions. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity
securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their
own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may
involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates. The
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates will receive allocations of the Notes (subject to customary
closing conditions), which could affect future trading of the Notes. Certain Initial Purchasers and/or
their respective affiliates are lenders under the Senior Facilities. In addition, U.S. Bank National
Association and/or its respective affiliates is the facility agent under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may, in the future, act as hedge counterparties to
the Issuer, consistent with its customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers
and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially
the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

###### SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES 

**France**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France with their registered
offices or principal places of business in France. Most of the directors, officers and other executives
of the Issuer are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”).
Furthermore, most of the assets of the Issuer or the French Individuals are located outside the United
States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons
and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be
possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities,
_provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents_
in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil
law claims connected with the Notes against the Issuer, the Guarantors organized under the laws of
France and/or French Individuals.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters.
Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether
or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or
enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings
(exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive
jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte)
proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is
satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case
law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

- such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the
dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international
forum shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did
not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter;

- such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both
pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

- such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial
decisions (i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law,
that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has
become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time
enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such
U.S. judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from
the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared
enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.


-----

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected
under certain circumstances by French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law
No. 80 538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to
the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or
technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence
in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative US action. Pursuant
to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970
Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence
in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data
files and individual liberties, as modified) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of
obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or
administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law
designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to
govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i)
French international public policy or (ii) overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case
basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or
state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual)
can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations
contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with
French Individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by
a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted
by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant. For a long time, case law has
interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not
be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according
to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an
action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the
dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its
rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way
of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation,
the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code
may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to
Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil
Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to
sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. The French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive_
jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent
jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents
would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a
French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

**England and Wales**

The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty between them providing for
the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil
and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state
court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order


-----

to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated
before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court
would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court, and it
would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no
good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all
or part of a claim without proceeding to trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an
English court in such an action is conditional upon, among others, the following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts
of laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, it does not matter
that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had
jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international law);

- the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it (even if the judgment is subject to subsequent
appeal) and being for a debt for a definite sum of money;

- the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human
Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the
extent applicable);

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like
nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non- English
penal or revenue law;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of
the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural
justice;

- there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English or
other non-U.S. court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties;

- the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the
U.S.;

- the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English
court; and

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S.
judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil
and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we
cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In
addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil
liability if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an
original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Furthermore, it may not be
possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor
is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or
counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment


-----

debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally
brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the
U.S. proceedings.

**The Netherlands**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain United States court judgments in
the Netherlands is based upon advice provided to us by our Dutch legal advisors. The Dutch
Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law and have their registered seat in the Netherlands. A
substantial amount of the assets of the Dutch Guarantors’ directors are located outside of the United
States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts
against the Dutch Guarantors.

It is uncertain whether a Dutch court will accept jurisdiction and impose civil or other liability in an
original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.
The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial
matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be
recognized or be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in
the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court and the judgment
rendered by the foreign court must be submitted in the course of such proceedings, in which case the
Dutch court will have to decide whether and to what extent it, given the circumstances of the case,
will recognize the foreign judgment. This court will have the discretion to attach such weight to the
judgment rendered by the relevant U.S. court as it deems appropriate. Based on case law, the Dutch
courts can be expected to adjudicate substantial importance to a final, conclusive and enforceable
judgment as to monetary obligations rendered by a U.S. federal or state court of competent
jurisdiction, without full re-examination or full re-litigation of the substantive matters adjudicated
upon (marginale toetsing), provided that (a) that judgment results from proceedings compatible with
the Dutch concept of due process (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (b) that judgment does not contravene
public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the court has been based on
an internationally acceptable ground, (d) the judgment by the court is not incompatible with a
judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered
between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is
based on the same cause, provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the
Netherlands and (e) that judgment is, according to the law of its country of origin, formally capable of
being enforced (it is readily enforceable, has not been annulled in appeal or its enforceability has not
been subject to a certain time frame).

Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only
to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. The enforcement and
recognition of judgments of United States courts in the Netherlands are subject to the Dutch rules of
civil procedure. Dutch civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of
respects. Insofar as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other
jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trail discovery, a process by which parties to the
proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the
deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any
proceeding. No similar pre-trial discovery process exists under Dutch law.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable
treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such
judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.


-----

**Italy**

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final, enforceable and conclusive judgments rendered by U.S.
courts, including judgments obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
U.S. federal or state securities laws may not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided
that pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di
_diritto_ _internazionale privato), among others, the following conditions are met:_

- the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law
principles of jurisdiction;

- the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance
with U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been
violated;

- the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the
event of

- the defendant party’s failure to appear before the court, the U.S. court declared such default in
accordance with U.S. law;

- the judgment is final and binding and not subject to any further appeal (passato in giudicato) in
accordance with U.S. law;

- there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

- there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which
commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

- the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by
a U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is
necessary, then a proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in Italy to that
end.

**Spain**

The description of Spanish law set forth below discusses the service of process on, and enforcement
of civil liabilities, against the Spanish guarantors.

A final unappealable judgment obtained against Spanish companies outside of Spain (and, in
particular, in the United States), other than in a country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation
1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, would be recognized and enforced by the
courts of Spain (unless such judgment contravenes principles of Spanish public policy) pursuant to the
following regimes (i) according to the provisions of any applicable treaty (there being none currently
in existence between Spain and the United States for these purposes); and (ii) in the absence of any
such treaty, the judgment would be enforced in Spain if it satisfies all of the following requirements in
compliance with and subject to Article 523 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de
_enero de Enjuiciamiento Civil) and subject to Law 29/2015, of July 30, on International Legal_
Cooperation in Civil Matters (Ley 29/2015, de 30 de julio, de Cooperación Jurídica _Internacional en_
_materia civil) (the “Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters”) which repeals Articles_
951 to 958 of the former Spanish Civil Procedure Act of 1881 (Real Decreto de _Promulgación de 3 de_
_febrero de 1881 de Enjuiciamiento Civil);_

- such judgment is final and conclusive (firme);


-----

- such judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter since the dispute is
clearly connected to the relevant court and the choice of the court is not fraudulent;

- the judgment is not contrary to Spanish public policy or mandatory provisions and the obligation
to be fulfilled is legal in Spain;

- the documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement is accompanied by a
literal, authentic, sworn Spanish translation;

- the copy of the judgment presented before the Spanish Court is duly apostilled; there is not a
pending previous proceeding between the same parties and in relation to the same issues in
Spain;

- there is not an incompatible judgment rendered in Spain or previously rendered in another
country when this last judgment meets the requirements to be eventually recognized in Spain;

- where rendering the judgment, the courts rendering it did not infringe an exclusive ground of
jurisdiction provided for under Spanish law or based their jurisdiction on exorbitant grounds and
the choice of court is not fraudulent;

- that the foreign judgment meets the requirements provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Act if
the Issuer is subject to insolvency proceedings in Spain;

- the rights of defense of the defendant were protected where rendering the judgment, including,
but not limited to, a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for the defendant
to prepare its defense and the foreign judgment was not rendered by default; and

- finally, although reciprocity is not a legal requirement, if it were proven that the foreign
jurisdiction in which the judgment was obtained does not recognize judgments issued by
Spanish courts on a general basis, then the Spanish courts could be compelled to deny the
recognition of the foreign judgment in Spain.

According to Article 3.2 of Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters the Spanish
Government may deny cooperation with other state’s authorities if there has been a repeated refusal of
cooperation or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation by such other state’s authorities provided
that the Spanish Government passes a Royal Decree for these purposes.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States of America could be
adversely affected under certain circumstances by Spanish law (relating to communication of
documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to
foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in Spain or from
Spanish persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Spanish courts may
express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due and payable by the
Issuer or Guarantors, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest will be paid in
euros. Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country bound by the
provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12
December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

Furthermore, and according to Article 47 of Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters,
there is a special provision and a special rule concerning the recognition of foreign judgments
rendered in proceedings resulting from collective action, which may be enforced in Spain insofar as
they satisfy the conditions set forth therein. The Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil
Matters expressly prohibits that a foreign judgment is reviewed as to its substance (revisión del fondo)
by the competent Spanish court.


-----

Any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain must file an application
seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) with the relevant Spanish
Judge of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo
_Mercantil). Once a judgment has been recognized under the_ _exequatur_ procedure, it will be
enforceable in Spain in accordance with the Spanish Civil Procedure Act (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero,
_de Enjuiciamiento Civil) in particular, it will be applicable the lapse of legal action (five years)._

The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount
due and payable by the Issuer or the Guarantors, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs
and interest will be paid in euros. Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors
in any country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and
of the Council would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

The enforcement of any judgment in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs: (a)
translation fees for documents in a language other than Spanish, which must be accompanied by a
sworn translation into Spanish; (b) foreign documents may be required to be legalized and apostilled;
(c) certain professional fees for the verification of the legal representative of a party litigating in
Spain, if needed; (d) judicial tax and fees; (e) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be
directed by an attorney at law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); and (f)
the content and validity of foreign law must be evidenced to the Spanish courts (which could, again,
entail certain costs). In addition, Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of
the parties and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes.

As an alternative to the exequatur proceedings, the parties might agree to bring the original action to
Spain, so that the dispute is settled by Spanish courts. Pursuant to Article 54 of the current Spanish
Civil Procedure Act (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamiento Civil), the parties to an agreement
are entitled to clearly agree to the submittal to one judge (juzgado) or court (tribunal) (provided that
under the Spanish Civil Procedure Act and the Spanish Judicial Act (Ley Orgánica 6/1985, de 1 de
_Julio, del_ _Poder Judicial) the relevant judge or court is competent to solve the corresponding dispute);_
this article does not expressly cover the validity of nonexclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for
conflicts between different Spanish courts. If an original action is brought in Spain, the choice of law
made by the parties may be rejected by Spanish courts on grounds that it contravenes Spanish public
policy.

**Australia**

Australia has a procedure for recognizing and enforcing foreign judgments by registration of the
foreign judgment in an Australian court in accordance with the procedure set out in the Australian
Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth) or by recognition in accordance with common law principles. The
United States is not one of the countries to which the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth) applies. As a
result, the recognition and enforcement in Australian courts of judgments from U.S. courts requires
the application of common law principles, as the procedure set out in the Foreign Judgments Act 1991
(Cth) will not apply. Further, any action taken by or on behalf of the holders of the Notes would need
to be brought in the Australian courts on the basis of the merits of the case as well as the judgment
from the relevant U.S. court.

Accordingly, there are risks as to the enforceability, in original actions in Australian courts, of
liabilities predicated solely on the U.S. federal or state securities law and as to the enforceability, in
Australian courts, of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the U.S. federal securities law. Also, judgments of U.S. courts (whether or not such
judgments relate to U.S. federal or state securities laws) may not be enforceable in Australia in certain
other circumstances, including, among others, to the extent that such judgments (as a matter of
applicable Australian law) contravene public policy, breach the rules of natural justice or general
principles of fairness or are obtained by fraud or duress or are based on a clear mistake of fact, are not
for a fixed or readily ascertainable sum, are subject to appeal, dismissal, stay of execution or are


-----

otherwise not final and conclusive, or involve multiple or punitive damages or where the proceedings
in such courts were of a revenue or penal nature, or where the judgment is one in respect of which the
Australian Commonwealth Attorney-General has made a declaration or order under the Australian
Foreign Proceedings (Excess of Jurisdiction) Act 1984 (Cth).

**Germany**

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on U.S. federal or state
securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S.
federal or state courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be
enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be
recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits
of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not
final under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set
forth in section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist:

- if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment
did not have jurisdiction;

- if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a
defense, provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads
accordingly;

- if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a
foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany;

- if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible
with a proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before
the U.S. federal or state court entered its judgment;

- if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of
German law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights
(Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

- if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and
enforce a comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and
commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German
case law to the effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims
relating to assets (vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot,
however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also
doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original
action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities laws.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German
courts as incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may
reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that
they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Consequently, judgments awarding
monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws may not be


-----

enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of a penal or
punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so
far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions
based on common law provided for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings
may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the
deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any
proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor
such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party
may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such
circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such
persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which
such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment
not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of
process within Germany upon the Issuer or the Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on
the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of
November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed
to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the
fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by
virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court
(Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action
before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**Denmark**

The United States and Denmark currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not
be recognized or enforceable in Denmark without a review of the merits of the case. However, in any
such proceedings taken in the Danish courts, the Danish courts may give consideration to a final and
conclusive judgment obtained in the United States courts.

**Statutory auditor’s report on the review of the condensed interim consolidated financial**
**statements**

To the President,

**_Introduction_**

At your request and in our capacity as statutory auditor of Banijay Group, we have reviewed condensed
interim consolidated financial statements the accompanying (the "Financial Information") for the
period then ended prepared in the context of the presentation of the Financial Information to Banijay
Group’s Supervisory Board.

Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of this Financial Information in
accordance with IAS 34 – IFRS as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express a
conclusion on this Financial Information based on our review.

**_Scope of Review_**

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
which applies to a review of historical financial information performed by the independent auditor of
the Entity. A review of the Financial Information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an
audit opinion.

**_Conclusion_**

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying Financial Information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
IAS 34 – IFRS as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial information.

This report is addressed to your attention within the context described above and may not be used,
circulated, quoted, or otherwise referred to for any other purpose. We assume or take no responsibility
towards third parties to whom this report is distributed or made available.


-----

This report is governed by, and construed in accordance with French law. The courts of France shall
have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any claim or dispute concerning the engagement letter or this
report, and any matter arising from them. Each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
object to an action being brought in any of those courts, to claim that the action has been brought in
an inconvenient forum or to claim that those courts do not have jurisdiction.

###### 5. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**_5.1. Corporate information_**

Banijay Group S.A.S. (the “Company") is a limited liability company domiciled in France and with its head office
located at 5, rue François 1er – 75 008 Paris (France).
The condensed consolidated financial statements of Banijay Group for the period ended December 31, 2022,
were closed by the Chairman in order to be presented to the supervisory board’s meeting of Banijay Group
Holding on March 14, 2023.

Banijay Group S.A.S has a share capital of € 104 215 171 (104 215 171 shares of € 1.00 each) and is the parent
entity of the Banijay group. LOV Group Invest S.A.S. is the ultimate parent of the group. FL Entertainment,
listed vehicle in Amsterdam, is one of the intermediate holdings.

Banijay Group is in the business of producing audiovisual programs, managing, and marketing of intellectual
property rights in relation to audiovisual and digital contents and / or formats.

The consolidated financial statements present the financial situation of the Company and its subsidiaries (the
“group”). They are denominated in Euro as this is the currency used for the majority of the group’s
transactions.

Banijay Group’s annual reporting date for its financial statements is December 31.


-----

**_5.2. Significant events_**

**_FL Entertainment_**

In May 2022, Stéphane Courbit announced that the Banijay Group together with the online sports gambling
group, Betclic would go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by prominent
investors. The deal gives the new company, FL Entertainment, an enterprise value of €7.2bn, or €4.1bn in
equity value. The shares have begun trading on Euronext in Amsterdam, The Netherlands on July 1, 2022.

As part of this operation, Banijay Group share value was reassessed and some Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
instruments, indexed on the Banijay Group share value, were also reassessed accordingly.

**_Russian / Ukrainian conflict_**

The group is closely monitoring the situation between Russia and Ukraine in order to anticipate any fall-out
that could affect our business there and beyond.
On the fourth quarter of 2022, our Russian entity Weit Media (now gathering Mastiff Russia and Weit Media
activities) is deconsolidated as, in fact, we lost our operational control and a selling project is underway.

The group has limited exposure to the Russian market. In 2022, its Russian subsidiaries generated a net
revenue of €27m (0.8% of Group revenue as of December) and current operating profit of €2m (0.9% of
Group Current operating profit as of December 2022).


-----

**_5.3. Accounting principles and methods_**

All amounts in the consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of euros, unless otherwise
specified. The fact that figures have been rounded off to the nearest decimal point may, in certain cases, result
in minor discrepancies in the totals and sub-totals in the tables and/or in the calculation of percentage
changes.

**5.3.1.** **Compliance with IFRS**

The consolidated financial statements of the group for the twelve months’ period ended December 31, 2022
have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) applicable at that
date, and the relevant interpretation standards (SIC/IFRIC) registered by the European Commission and in
force at such date, which, for those relevant to the Company, do not present any difference with the
accounting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

**New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the group from January 1, 2022**

Several amendments apply for the first time in 2022, but do not have any impact on Banijay in the current
reporting period.

**Standards and interpretations that are not yet effective have not been applied by anticipation by the group**

The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not
yet effective.

**5.3.2.** **Main estimates and accounting assumptions**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the group requires the management to use certain
estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the carrying amount of revenues, costs, assets, and
liabilities. The main estimates and assumptions relate to (i) the valuation and useful lives of audiovisual rights,
(ii) the valuation of goodwill, (iii) the amount of provisions for risks and other provisions in relation with the
group’s activity, (iv) the calculation of debt related to earn outs on acquisitions, (v) the estimate of debt
resulting from put options in favour of minority shareholders, and (vi) the assumptions used for share-based
payments.

The features of main accounting methods, judgements and other uncertainties which affect the application of
these accounting methods, as well as the sensitivity of the results to changes in the conditions and
assumptions, are factors to be considered while reading these financial statements, as the outcomes of these
estimations will, by definition, rarely equal the actual figures.

There has been no significant change in the main estimates and accounting assumptions of the group over the
period.

_Goodwill impairment_
The group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if goodwill
has to be impaired. The latest impairment review was performed in December 2022 (see note 5.3.3 –


-----

Impairment of non-financial assets below).

_Content assets depreciation_
The group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if the
content assets presented in the balance sheet have to be impaired. The carrying value of these assets is
compared to the net sales forecast of the said format over a maximum period of 10 years.

_Earn-out payments / put option rights in favour of minority shareholders_
Following external growth transactions, the group can be committed to pay former/minority shareholders
either earn-outs or further acquisition price pursuant to put options on their remaining shareholding,
depending on future profits. Related debts are accounted for in the balance sheet at their present value.
The group estimates these debts using assumptions on future profits and calculates scheduled cash outflows
using a discount rate.

_Share-based payments and Long-term incentive plans_
Share subscription, purchase options, phantom shares as well as free shares have been granted to certain
employees of the group. The value of these plans depends on future profits of the relevant subsidiaries as well
as on the equity value of the group.

**5.3.3.** **Summary of key accounting methods**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and those of its
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures on December 31, 2022. The financial statements of main
subsidiaries are prepared on the same accounting period as that of the Company, using homogeneous
accounting principles.
All balances, transactions, revenues and expenses, intra-group profits and losses resulting from transactions
with subsidiaries are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the group acquires control. They continue to be
fully consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The results of the operations of subsidiaries acquired
or sold during a given year are recognized in the consolidated results from the date of acquisition or up to the
date of divestment.

Non-controlling Interests represent the portion of profit or loss and the net assets not owned by the group in
a given subsidiary. They are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss as well as in equity in the
consolidated balance sheet, separately from the equity attributable to the shareholders of the group.

**Current / non-current distinction**

According to IAS 1 - Presentation of financial statements, the assets and liabilities are classified as current
when their recoverability or their payment is expected no later than 12 months from the closing date, except
for deferred taxes which are shown as non-current assets and liabilities.

**Consolidation scope and methods**


**_Subsidiaries_**


In accordance with IFRS 10, the subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date when the group acquires the


-----

control over the subsidiary. Under this standard, the group controls a subsidiary if and only if all the conditions
below are met:

Having power over the investee, i.e. the group has existing rights that gives it the ability to direct the
relevant activities (the activities that significantly affect the subsidiary's returns)
Having exposure, or rights, to variable returns from the involvement with the subsidiary
Having the ability to use its power over the subsidiary to affect the amount of the group's returns.

When minority shares are subject to put and call options that give Banijay Group a present ownership on the
underlying shares, no non-controlling interest are recognized in Banijay Group’s consolidated financial
statements related to those minority shares. The group recognises a financial liability corresponding to the
expected present value of the debt that will be paid to the holders following the exercise of those put and call
options.


**_Joint ventures and associates_**


Joint ventures are the companies in which the Company exercises a joint control. Associates are investments
in which the Company exercises a significant influence, i.e. it has the power to participate in the financial and
operational decisions but does not have control. The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures
and associates using the equity method.

Under this method, interests in associates and joint ventures are recorded in the balance sheet at acquisition
cost and are increased or reduced by the group’s share in the entity’s net assets, post-acquisition. Goodwill
relating to acquired associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment and
is not depreciated.

The statement of profit or loss reflects the group's part in the results of operations of the related entity.
Significant profits and losses resulting from transactions between the group and the associates and joint
ventures are eliminated up to the percentage of interest in the entity.

The percentage of legal interest held by the group in the consolidated companies as well as the consolidation
methods are disclosed in Note 5.15 ‘Consolidation scope’.

**Foreign currency translation**

The consolidated financial statements are established in euro, which is the functional and presentation
currency of the group.


**_Translation of foreign-currency denominated transactions_**


Each entity determines its own functional currency. The items of each entity's financial statements are
measured using the functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded initially at the
exchange rate of the functional currency prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedging rate, if applicable.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate of the
functional currency at the closing date and the resulting exchange differences are recognized in the statement
of profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are reported
using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the initial transactions.


Long-term monetary assets held by an entity of the group in a foreign subsidiary for which a settlement is


-----

neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, are a part of the net foreign investments. Thus,
pursuant to the provisions of lAS 21 "The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates", corresponding
exchange rate differences are entered into “other comprehensive income” until the date the investment is
disposed of. Otherwise, the exchange differences are recorded as profit or loss.

Likewise, gains or losses exchange differences relating to intercompany loans that are hedging instruments for
net investments abroad, as provided for by IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments “ are recognized as Other
comprehensive income.


**_Translation of subsidiaries’ foreign currency denominated financial statements_**


Assets and liabilities, including goodwill of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euro at the official exchange
rate prevailing on the balance sheet date and their statement of profit or loss is translated at the average
exchange rate over the period considered. The resulting exchange differences are booked directly to equity in
a separate heading denominated “Foreign currency translation reserve”. When a foreign entity is sold, the
exchange differences accumulated in the “foreign currency translation reserve” allocated to the entity are
transferred to profit or loss.

**Intangible assets**


Intangible assets include:


format rights acquired from a third party or through business combinations. They can be commercially
exploited either through internal use, i.e. the production of television programs by a group entity, or
through external use, i.e. the sale or licensing to third parties,
audiovisual rights, or catalogues, referred to as the group’s library of finished programs, whether acquired
or internally developed, for which the group has legal right to distribute and to receive revenue from the
distribution of the rights,
production contracts or client contracts, acquired through business combinations, for the production of
television programs, TV movies, or cinematic movies,
fictions in progress: costs incurred for fiction productions that are not yet finalized and not delivered to
the client at the closing date, and for which (i) the group retains the IP and (ii) the group expects significant
further IP revenue.
other intangible assets: rights for the movie adaptation of books, software, etc.


**_Initial recognition_**


Initial recognition of intangible assets is at cost, except for those acquired in a business combination, which
are recognized at fair value.


**_Depreciation & amortization_**


Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses.


Audiovisual rights are considered to have a definite useful life.


Intangible assets are depreciated based on the consumption of the associated economic benefits and on the
remaining useful life of the asset. Hence, audiovisual rights are depreciated on an accelerated basis following


-----

the decline in the net value of the asset following its initial broadcasting by the clients.


Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are depreciated:


Catalogue & formats: on a straight-line basis between a period of 6 to 10 years
Client contracts: on a straight-line basis over the contract duration


Software assets are depreciated over their estimated useful life (between 1 and 5 years).


The depreciation period and the amortization method are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits
embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the depreciation period or method.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at their acquisition cost, less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of such fixed assets.
The residual value, the useful life and depreciation methods of the fixed assets are reviewed and adjusted, if
necessary, at each financial year-end.

**Leases**


**_Right-of-use assets_**


The group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying
asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets
includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or
before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the group is reasonably certain to
obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-ofuse assets are subject to impairment.


**_Lease liabilities_**


At the commencement date of the lease, the group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value
of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including insubstance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an
index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also
include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the group and payments
of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the group exercising the option to terminate. The
variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense in the period on
which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease
commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The interest used at
the inception of the contract will be the same for the whole life of the lease term aside if there are


-----

modifications in contract terms such as a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease
payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.


**_Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_**


The group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of equipment (i.e., those
leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a
purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office
equipment and cars that are considered of low value.

Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the lease term.


**_Significant judgement in determining the lease term of contacts with renewal options_**


The group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods
covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by
an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The group has the option, under some of its real estate leases to lease the assets for additional terms of several
years. The group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to
renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal.
After the commencement date, the group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in
circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew
(e.g., a change in business strategy).

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

In accordance with IAS36 – Impairment of Assets, the Group assesses the recoverable amount of intangible
assets, goodwill and tangible assets is tested for impairment as soon as external or internal signs of impairment
losses exist, such signs being reviewed at each closing date (sector ratio declining, strong overall decrease in
the business relating to the cash generating unit, fall in activity with a major customer of the cash-generating
unit...).

If applicable, the recoverable amount of the asset is tested for impairment to determine whether there is an
impairment loss.

Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, this test is performed at least once a year.
Concerning the goodwill, this requires the recoverable value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill
has been allocated, to be measured. The group mainly estimates the recoverable value through its value-inuse. The latter is determined by the management through a projection of expected future cash flows that are
discounted at an appropriate rate

If appropriate, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the net book value of the asset exceeding the
recoverable amount (mostly measured through the asset’s value-in-use).

The recoverable value of the assets to which it is possible to directly attribute independent cash inflows is
assessed on a stand-alone basis. The other assets are grouped within the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to
which they belong to estimate their value-in-use. A CGU is defined as the smallest group of assets that


-----

generates cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.


Banijay’s CGU are managed through three operating segments as defined by IFRS 8. These correspond to our
three specific trades: Production, Distribution and Holding.

Production segment is split by geographical segments:
. CGU 1: UK – USA / LATAM – Australia – India – Israel


. CGU 2: Nordics – Netherlands – Belgium – Germany – Poland


. CGU 3: France – Spain – Italy – Portugal


Distribution
. CGU 4: Distribution / Rights

The goodwill from significant acquisitions (Zodiak Media in 2016 and Endemol Shine Group in 2021) have been
allocated to different CGUs according to the territories and taking into consideration the similarities between
the different markets. Currently, Banijay Group management considers 4 CGUs as described above.

The value-in-use of an asset or a CGU is measured by the method of discounted cash flows, based on
projections of future financial cash flows over the next 4 years. Forecasts are derived from plans presented
and approved by the Chairman and the Supervisory Board of the Company. A long-term growth rate is applied
to project cash flows after the fourth year.

By assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted; the discount rate is a post-tax
rate and reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset.

Where an impairment loss is recognized, it is accounted for directly in the statement of profit or loss under
a specific heading.


Impairment losses recognized for goodwill can never be reversed.


The value of assets, other than goodwill, for which an impairment loss has been recorded, is reviewed at
each closing date for the purposes of reversing the impairment loss, if necessary. Where a reversal occurs,
it is recorded as profit or loss. In such a case, the book value of the asset can be increased up to its
recoverable value. After reversing the impairment loss, the book value cannot exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined, net of amortization or depreciation, had no impairment loss been
recognized for the asset in prior years.

**Financial instruments**


Financial instruments consist of:


**Financial assets, including other non-current assets, trade receivables, other current assets, cash**
management assets and cash and cash equivalents;
**Financial liabilities, including long- and short-term borrowings and bank overdrafts, accounts and**
notes payable and other current and non-current liabilities;
**Derivative instruments**

**Financial instruments (assets and liabilities) are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position**
at the fair value on initial recognition, plus in the case of an asset that is not subsequently recognized at fair


-----

value through profit or loss, transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of that asset.


They are subsequently measured at either fair value (result or other comprehensive income) or amortised
costs, depending on their nature.

**Amortized cost corresponds to the initial carrying amount (net of transaction costs), plus interest calculated**
using the effective interest rate, less cash outflows (coupon interest payments and repayments of principal
and redemption premiums where applicable). Accrued interest (income and expense) is not recorded on the
basis of the financial instrument’s nominal interest rate, but on the basis of its effective interest rate.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability
settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.


**_Financial assets_**


The classification of a financial asset in each of these categories depends on the management model applied
by the enterprise and the characteristics of its contractual cash flows.


Transactions relating to financial assets are recorded at settlement date.


_Debt instrument at amortised cost_


These financial assets are initially recognized at their fair value to which is added directly attributable
transaction costs and, then at amortised cost at each closing date, applying the effective interest rate method.

This category of assets includes trade receivables and other debtors, loans and deposits, receivables attached
to participating interests, cash and loans to associates or non-consolidated entities. In practice, trade
receivables are measured to the amortised cost method, even though they may be subject to an assignment
of receivables, for example, in the context of factoring.


_Equity instrument at fair value through OCI_


The group elected to classify irrevocably its non-listed equity investments under this category as it intends to
hold these investments for the foreseeable future.


_Impairment testing of debtor financial assets_


The group reviews if, at the closing date, a debtor financial asset or a group of debt financial assets is likely to
suffer an impairment loss based on both the expected credit loss approach and when there is an objective
indicator of loss.

In practice, given the weak level of loss incurred on prior years’ receivables, the expected credit loss approach
does not have any significant impact.

If there is objective evidence that debtor financial assets carried at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI
should be impaired, the amount of the loss is estimated by difference between the book value and the
discounted future cash flows such as expected (excluding future probable and not actual credit losses). The
discount rate used is the initial effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial
recognition of the asset). The book value is reduced through the use of an allowance account. The amount of
the loss is recorded as profit or loss.


-----

If, subsequently, the impairment decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring
after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment will be reversed. The reversal of
an impairment loss is recognized as profit or loss, as long as the book value of the asset does not exceed its
amortised cost at the date the loss allowance is reversed.

With respect to receivables, a loss allowance is recorded when there is objective evidence (probability of
insolvency or severe financial difficulties of the debtor) that the group will be unable to recover the balance in
accordance with the initial payment conditions. The book value of the receivable is reduced by way of an
allowance for loss. Impaired receivables are derecognized when they are considered as uncollectible.


**_Financial liabilities_**


Financial liabilities are divided into two categories: financial liabilities at amortised cost and financial liabilities
at fair value through profit or loss.

The financial liabilities of the group mainly consist of liabilities valued at amortised cost. Among them are loans
and similar debts including:

Credit lines from banks and other production financings;
Bank overdrafts;
Borrowings;
Lease debts;
Bonds and Secured Notes.

The category of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss includes liabilities that should have been
explicitly designated at initial recognition by the group of which earn out and Put over minority interest.


_Interest-bearing debts and borrowings_


All loans, and debts are recognized initially at the fair value of the consideration received, less costs directly
attributable to the transaction.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing liabilities and debts are evaluated at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method.

Costs directly attributable to the issuance of debt are deducted from liabilities and are amortised over the life
of the debt, as a component of the effective interest rate.

**Derecognition of financial instruments (assets and liabilities)**
Financial instruments (assets and liabilities) are derecognized when the related risks and rewards of ownership
have been transferred, and when the group no longer exercises control over the instruments.

Gains and losses are recognized as profit or loss when assets or liabilities are derecognized using the model of
amortised cost.


**_Derivative financial instruments_**


The group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts, options and interest rate


-----

swaps to cover its risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. These
derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on the date on which they are contracted.
They are then re-estimated at their fair value at each closing date. Derivative financial instruments are
recognized as assets in the balance sheet when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is
negative.

For derivatives that meet the criteria of hedge accounting, gains or losses related to change in the fair value
of derivatives during the financial year are accounted for in “other comprehensive income” in case of cash
flow hedge or through P&L in case of Fair Value hedge. For derivatives that do not meet the hedge accounting,
they are recognized directly as profit or loss.

The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to the forward exchange rates
applicable to contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is
determined by reference to the market values of similar instruments.

The fair value of financial instruments that are traded on active markets is determined at each closing date by
reference to the market quotations or transaction prices. Transaction costs are not taken into account.

For instruments that are not traded on an active market, fair value is determined using appropriate valuation
techniques. These may include:

Transactions entered into under normal market conditions between knowledgeable and willing parties;
reference to the present fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same;
discounted cash flows or other valuation methods.

**Contract balances**

If accrued revenue constitutes an unconditional right to payment or consideration, i.e., if the passage of time
is sufficient for payment of the consideration to fall due, the accrued revenue will constitute a receivable. In
all other cases, it constitutes the contract assets.

Revenue accruals are classified in “Trade and other receivables” since accrued revenue constitutes an
unconditional right to a consideration.

Advance payments received from customers and deferred income are the contract liabilities. They are
classified in “Other current liabilities”.

**Inventories**

Inventories relating to work in progress are valued at production cost. They represent outstanding production
of audiovisual programs, excluding fictions for which (i) the group retains a part of the IP and (ii) expects
significant IP revenues, that are not finalised and not delivered to the client at closing date. In the case that
production losses are anticipated, a provision for losses on onerous contract is accounted for, after inventories
have been written off.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and short-term deposits include liquid and available bank accounts subject to limited changes in fair value
as well as short-term deposits whose initial maturity is less than three months.


-----

For the needs of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are composed of the
cash and cash equivalent as defined above reduced by bank overdrafts.

**Provisions**


Provisions are recorded only if:


the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; and
it is likely that an expenditure will be required to settle the obligation; and
a reliable estimate can be made as to the amount of the payment obligation.

The charges relating to provisions are accounted for as profit or loss, net of any contingent reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a discount pre-tax rate
that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the obligation. When discounting, the increase in the
provision due to the passage of time is recognized in net financial income (loss).


**_Pensions and other defined post-employment benefit plans_**


The group’s obligations under defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are
computed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The actuarial valuation involves
making assumptions such as discount rates, retirement date, staff turnover, future increases of wages,
mortality rates and future pension increases.

For these post-employment benefit plans, the actuarial gains and losses are immediately and entirely
recognized in other comprehensive income with no possibility of recycling in the income statement.
Past service costs are immediately and fully recorded in the income statement on acquired rights as well as on
future entitlements.


The effect of discounting of the provision are presented in the net financial income (loss).


**_Other provisions_**


All disputes (type, amounts, procedure and level of risk) are identified by the Legal Department of the group
which ensures regular monitoring. The amount of provisions for the claims result from a case by case analysis,
depending on the positions of the litigants, on the estimation of the risks by the group’s legal advisors and on
first instance decisions, if any.

By nature, some provisions are based on estimates and assumptions without considering a precise deadline
for the corresponding cash outflows.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in a contract with
a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognizes revenue when it
transfers control of a product or service to a customer.

The revenue from ordinary activities is recognized as soon as the economic benefits of the transaction will
probably benefit the Group, the amount is reliably measured, and it is likely the amount of the transaction will
be recovered.


-----

Revenue recognition is based on the delivery of performance obligations and an assessment of when control
is transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognised either when the performance obligation in the contract
has been performed (‘point in time’ recognition) or ‘over time’ as control of the performance obligation is
transferred to the customer.

Customer contracts can have a wide variety of performance obligations, from production contracts to format
licences and distribution activities. For these contracts, each performance obligation is identified and
evaluated.

The transaction price, being the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled under the contract, is
allocated to the identified performance obligations. The transaction price will also include an estimate of any
variable consideration where the Group’s performance may result in additional revenues based on the
achievement of agreed targets such as audience targets. Variable consideration is not recognised until the
performance obligations are met.


**_Production revenues (from producing television programs)_**


Production revenues are recognized when the programs are delivered to the client. Standard criteria to


determine that the performance obligations have been fulfilled and revenue can be recognized are:


in most cases: client's acceptance document (i.e. delivery notice signed / approved by the client, …)
delivery of a certain number of episodes

In case of partial delivery of the same program over several periods of time (series, etc...), revenue, costs and
margin are recognized according to episodic deliveries.
Production revenues do not include grants, subsidies and co-producers’ contributions. These are presented
as a reduction of cost of sales.


**_Distribution revenues (from the sale of finished programs and formats)_**


Distribution revenues are recognized when the rights are transferred to the client:


on the basis of a signed contract or a deal memo, and
when the related rights are opened, and
for the full revenue (revenues are not spread over the licensing period), as it is an access to right since
there is limited ongoing involvement in the use of the licence following its transfer to the customer.


**_Revenues from other rights and services_**


Other rights and services include merchandising, music rights, other ancillary revenues and digital services.


Merchandising revenues are recognized when the rights are transferred to the client:


on the basis of a signed contract or a deal memo, and
when the licensing period begins, and
for the full revenue (revenues are not spread over the licensing period).

Minimum guarantee revenues are recognized as revenue when the above criteria are met, and further variable
payments are recognized when received.


-----

Revenues from music rights are recognized as revenues when received based on royalties’ statements (output
method).

Revenues and costs related to the rendering of services are recognized on completion of the service rendered
as long as they can be estimated reliably.

When the outcome of the transaction cannot be estimated reliably, revenue shall be recognized only to the
extent of the expenses recognized.


**_Principal vs agent consideration_**


The group is considered as principal in most of its “performance obligation”.


In the course of its business, the group resells finished tape or formats purchased from third parties. Given it
obtains the right to distribute the content, Banijay usually controls the licence.

The distinction between agent and principal has an impact on the presentation of revenue, which is recognized
as follows:

on a gross basis when the group is a principal;
net of the cost of sales when the group is an agent.

**Production costs**

Production costs are net of co-producers’ contributions, grants and subsidies.
They mainly include the costs of scripts, actors, directors, rental of equipment, technical staff, participants,
hosts, sets, format fees, etc.

Until programs are delivered, related production costs are capitalized in work in progress for non-scripted
programs and as intangible assets for scripted programs for which (i) the group retains the IP and (ii) the group
expects significant further IP revenue.

At revenue recognition date, the production costs of non-scripted programs are expensed in the income
statement.

The production costs of scripted programs for which the group retains the IP and expects further significant IP
revenue are amortized as production costs in the statement of profit or loss using the ultimate revenue
method. The cumulated amortization is calculated at the end of a given year as follows:


Production costs x (actual cumulated revenue / total estimated revenue of program).


The total estimated revenue of a program is the sum of actual cumulated revenue of the program and the
program’s future revenue forecast. Depreciation for a current year is calculated by difference with cumulated
depreciation of previous years, if any. An impairment is booked if the net value of the program is higher than
the future revenue forecast.

Initial depreciation of a scripted program is expensed at delivery while the remaining value is depreciated
when the subsequent distribution revenues are recognized.


-----

**_Grants and subsidies_**


Grants and subsidies are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and
all attached conditions will be fully complied with.

Grants and subsidies which are strictly related to the financing of a given program are deducted from
production costs. When they relate to an asset, grants and subsidies are directly deducted from the carrying
amount of the asset and released to the depreciation and amortization calculated on the net amount over the
useful life of the asset.

All other grants and subsidies (such as government grants not strictly related to a program) are recognized as
“Other operating income” when granted.

**Other non-current operating income and expenses**

These comprise income and expenses that are both unusual in nature and significant in terms of value at the
consolidated level. The group presents such income and expenses separately in the statement of profit or loss
in order to facilitate the understanding of the recurring operating performance.

**Long term incentive plan and employee benefit resulting from business combinations**


**_Long term incentive plan_**


Long term incentive plan (LTIP) includes share-based payment plan both phantom shares and free shares, that
have been granted to certain employees of the group and are settled in cash or equity, and some other long
term incentive plan usually based on the performance of one or several entities.

Most of those schemes are based on the local value creation of the entities in accordance with formulas mostly
based on operating KPI (such as operating profit) in which the beneficiaries of the plan are rendering services.

The group revaluates at each reporting date the fair value of the services that have been rendered to date by
the beneficiaries of the plan and the resulting expense is recorded under staff costs.


Several plans have been granted to certain key employees of the group. Main plan are disclosed here after:


**. Phantom shares plan (Perimeter and Group LTIP), granting phantom shares over a period of 4 years (2022 –**
2024) and 8 years of vesting (2022 – 2028).

Perimeter LTIP is based on the operating performance of each entity belonging to the plan. The value creation
compared to a floor will generate phantom shares of Banijay Group to the beneficiaries.

Group LTIP is based on the fair market value of Banijay Group share value. Beneficiaries will receive phantom
shares of Banijay Group.

The phantom shares value is mainly driven by the Banijay Group share value and is assessed by external
financial experts on a regular basis. Those phantom shares enable the beneficiaries to benefit from the value
creation of Banijay group shares.


-----

. Free shares plan.


Some managers have been granted a free share program of Banijay Group shares (existing or new shares).
Expected attribution date are 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2029. The dilutive effect at year end 2022 is
disclosed in notes 5.6.9 – Earnings per share.


**_Employee benefits resulting from a business acquisition arrangement_**


The Group generally prospects, identifies and acquires companies that create high value. It also looks for the
opportunity to secure acquisitions of companies held by talented managers with the strategy of maintaining
and incenting such managers after closing.
In this context, the transaction is often accompanied by an employment agreement or a service agreement
between the acquiree and the manager, pursuant to the closing. Share purchase agreements may also specify
restrictions on the acquisition price, on the potential earn-outs or on the remaining minority interest options
in case of early departure of the manager. These restrictions may be:

a reduction in the acquisition price,
forfeiture of earn-outs,
a reimbursement of significant parts the paid amounts,
a call option on minority interests held by the manager at a price less than the fair value

These contingent consideration arrangements aim at compensating former owners of the business acquired
for future services and shall be recognized as a separate transaction as required by IFRS 3.
Depending on the description of the contingent consideration, those transactions are recognized in
accordance with IFRS 2 (cash-settled share-based payment) or IAS 19 (long-term incentives):

When the terms of the agreements provide the possibility to deliver equity instruments to the manager,
or if the price is based on the fair value of the equity instruments, the grant is measured at fair value
(determined by an independent expert) in accordance with IFRS 2;
In any other case, the grant is measured on the basis of the expected discounted cash outflow in
accordance with IAS 19. The measurement is usually supported by business plans.

A liability is recognized for the goods or services acquired over the vesting period based on the fair value of
the liability. At each reporting date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the liability is
remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the year.
When the consideration has already been paid, this amount is initially recognized as an asset. Subsequently,
this arrangement is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as an asset or as a liability,
depending on the relationship between the manager’s performance and the payment.

**Tax**


**_Current tax_**


Tax receivables or tax payables for the current period and prior periods are estimated at the amount that is
expected to be received from or to be paid to the tax administration. Tax rates and tax laws used in order to
estimate the tax receivable or the tax liability are those which have been enacted at closing date.
Current income taxes pertaining to items recognized in “other comprehensive income” are recorded in the
same category and not as profit or loss.


-----

**_Deferred tax_**


Deferred taxes are accounted for using the liability method for all temporary differences between the carrying
amount recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position and the tax bases of assets and liabilities,
except for non-tax-deductible goodwill. Deferred taxes are determined based on the way in which the group
expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities using the tax rates that are
expected to apply in the year the asset will be realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws)
that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are offset when they have the same maturity and
relate to the same taxable entity. They are classified in the statement of financial position as non-current
assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which deductible temporary differences or tax losses and tax credit carryforwards can be
utilised.

**_5.4. Segment information_**

**5.4.1.** **Reporting by operating segment**

**5.4.1.1.** **Definition of group operating segment**

According to IFRS 8, an operating segment is a component of an entity that (i) engages in business activities
from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by
the entity’s chief operating decision maker to decide how resources should be allocated to the component
and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available.
As of December 31, 2022, Banijay Group recognizes three main operating segments:

   - Production activities (including digital), which encompasses all production entities of the group. These
entities form a single operating segment as the nature of their business is similar across the group
(mainly ‘the production of audiovisual contents’) and they present similar long-term economic
characteristics.
   - Distribution activities (including commercial), constituted by Banijay Rights, Banijay Brands and their
subsidiaries, whose activity differs from the rest of the group as those entities are in charge of selling
finished tapes and formats.
   - And ‘Holdings’ segment.

**5.4.1.2.** **Disclosure of operating segment information**

**Disposals during the period**

_Disposal of Weit Media (Russia)_

Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine on February 24[th], 2022, Banijay has analyzed the impact the situation
will have on its Russian entity Weit Media. In line with the European and American sanctions against Russia,
Banijay froze the operations with Weit Media. Therefore, from the fourth Quarter 2022 Banijay considers it
has lost control under IFRS10 of the subsidiary. In addition, on December 15[th], a selling contract was signed
with on-site managers, but the transaction is still pending to the agreement of the Russian Government
Commission.

_Disposal of Shauna Event (France)_

At the end of December 2022, Banijay shares in Shauna Events have been sold and therefore the Group has
lost control of this entity.

**_5.6. Notes to the statement of profit or loss_**

**5.6.1.** **Revenue**

Revenue reached €3 212m over the twelve-months period ended December 31, 2022, against €2 756m as of
December 31, 2021. This revenue essentially corresponds to the production and sale of audiovisual programs.

**_Remaining performance obligation_**

The remaining performance obligation corresponds to firm commitments (or closed sales).

The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations (unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied)
as of 31 December totalized €2 246m including €1 945m within one year and €301m beyond one year
(respectively in 2021 €1 602m including €1 404m within one year and €198m beyond one year).

The remaining performance obligations should essentially cover the revenue to be recognized for
undelivered productions and for sales of finished tapes/formats for which the rights are not opened.

**5.6.2.** **Operating expenses**

Main operating expenses corresponds to a part of the production costs for €1 220m (€1 033m in 2021), and
general and administrative expenses for €37m (€36m in 2021).
Production expenses also includes staff costs (cf. note 5.6.3) and some costs booked in external expenses such
as short-term leases or consultancy fees.

The intercompany elimination of distribution advances have been reclassified retrospectively from external
expenses to operating expenses (+€46m in 2022 and +€13m in 2021).


-----

**5.6.3.** **Staff costs**

Staff costs consist of remuneration of staff, including payroll expense (€1 223m in 2022 compared to €1 039m
in 2021), as well as expenses related to the following share-based payments schemes:

expenses related to plans allocating free shares, €4m (share-based payment equity settle) vs €2m in
prior year;
expenses related to phantom shares plans indexed on the increase in equity value €46m (share-based
payment cash settled) vs €33m in prior year. The variance is mostly explained by the implementation
of a new LTIP plan (2022 – 2028) and operational performance improvements;
expenses related to commitment to purchase shares of minority shareholders (put option) or to pay
earn out based on level of performance and conditioned to the existence of lock up mechanism €20m
compared to €13m in prior year. The change from the previous year is due to two main factors: change
in assumption on the valorisation and new acquisitions in 2022 with earn-out and put options defined
as remuneration;
other Long Term Incentive Plan (including social charges on free shares) amount to €10m compared
to €12m in prior year.

As described in note 5.3.3 – Long-term incentive plan, most LTIPs are contractually based on one or more
financial performance indicators.

**5.6.4.** **Other non-current operating income (expenses)**

Other non-current operating income (expenses) amount to €(28)m as of December 2022 and mostly
corresponded to restructuring costs for €(11)m, acquisition costs for €(3)m, change in consolidation scope for
€(8)m and litigations raised during the period €(4)m.
As of December 2021, other non-current operating income (expenses) amount to €(26)m and mostly
corresponded to restructuring costs, acquisition costs, other litigations raised during the period €(34)m; offset
by a capital gain of €8m on investment in associates.

**5.6.5.** **Cost of net debt**

The cost of net debt as of December 31, 2022 amount to €(130)m compared to €(124)m as of December 31,
2021. The variance is explained by:
   - The interests’ expenses of the Senior secured and not secured Notes and Term loans, issued on
February 11, 2021 (€(109)m in 2022 vs €(105)m in 2021);
   - The amortization of transaction costs related to the financing structures (€(15)m in 2022 and 2021),
and;
   - The interests charges of local production financing facilities (€(7)m in 2022 vs €(5)m in 2021) and the
interests income amount to €2m in 2022 related mostly to Brazil, India and Sweden.

out, put options assimilated as LTIP. These liabilities are discounted based on a 9.51% discount rate in
2022 (2021: 9.31%). This line also includes some discounting effect on revenue with regards to the
financing component under IFRS 15.

   - An impairment of €(2)m on a loan to a financial partner

   - Exchange gain and losses are mainly related to €3m unrealized and realized foreign exchange effect
(2021: €3m). 2021 impact was mainly driven by USD change effect of underlying USD403m bonds for
€21m.

   - The gains and losses on derivatives correspond to the mark to market variation of foreign exchange
hedging instruments: €10m (€2m in 2021).

   - The line “other” is mainly composed of €2m interests income on BETCLIC loan, €(3)m on interests and
commission expenses related to factoring

-----

The income tax for the twelve-months period ended December 31, 2022 amounts to €(40)m compared to
€(26)m in the twelve-months period ended December 31, 2021.

The group’s profit is realised in several countries. The tax rate is subject to changes in actual local tax rates
and depends on the relative contributions of the different countries in the group's profit.

Banijay Group’s effective tax rate is 48.7% for the twelve-months period ended December 31, 2022 compared
to 20.3% in 2021. Effective tax rate evolution is mainly driven by the impact of deferred tax position write off
(in France and Italy) following unfavourable tax planning.

The reconciliation of France legal tax rate with effective tax rate is presented as follows:

_* Tax rate applicable for the French tax group_

The impact of Recognition of Deferred tax for €(9)m is mainly related to derecognition of deferred tax in
France and Italy following unfavourable tax planning over the next 4 years.

**5.6.8.** **Share of profit of associates and joint ventures**

The share of profit from associates and joint ventures corresponds to the portion of profit or loss achieved
during the twelve-months period ended December 2022 by entities consolidated under the equity method (Cf
5.14).

**5.6.9.** **Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing attributable profit by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding treasury shares on a pro rata basis.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking into account all financial instruments carrying deferred rights
to the parent company's capital, issued either by the parent company itself or by any one of its subsidiaries.
Dilution is calculated separately for each instrument, based on the conditions prevailing at the end of the

_(PPA: Purchase price allocation)_

_(a)_ _Impact of change in consolidation scope on Goodwill : see note 5.5. The other columns are affected by disposal of entities during the period._
_(b)_ Reclassification on content assets +€10m is mainly explained by reclassification of some scripted programs initially classified into Work in Progress
and had been reclassified in intangible assets given the international future expected revenue.

Intangible assets, including goodwill, as of December 31, 2022 amount to €2 654m.

Content assets in progress consist in the total production costs of scripted programs not yet delivered at
reporting date and for which the group retains the Intellectual Property (IP) and expects to generate significant
future IP revenues.

For the twelve months’ period ended December 2022 depreciation / amortization of intangible assets (€81m)
is booked in “depreciation and amortization expenses” for €(80)m and current impairment losses for €(1)m.

**_Impairment test_**
The group has assessed if goodwill had to be impaired. The recoverable value of the cash generated unit to
which the goodwill has been measured based on the following key assumptions:

   - WACC (after tax): 9.51 %
   - Infinite growth rate: 2.25%
   - The financial projections are derived from the 2023 Budget and 2024 – 2026 business plan.

The projections include estimates for the cost savings that have been realized and are to be realized from
several cost savings initiatives. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties as
they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Accordingly,
actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may differ from those assumed in the forwardlooking statements.

**_Results of impairment tests_**
Based on the impairment tests conducted, no impairment needs to be charged against goodwill, intangible
and tangible assets.

**_Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_**
The sensitivity of impairment tests to adverse, feasible changes in assumptions is set out below:

   - reasonable sensitivity to changes in the discount rate: a simulated increase of up to 1 percentage point
in the discount rate used would not change the findings of the Group's analysis;
   - reasonable sensitivity to changes in the long-term growth rate: in a pessimistic scenario where the
long-term growth rate is reduced by 0.5 percentage points, the value in use of each CGU would still
exceed its carrying amount;
   - reasonable sensitivity to changes in the business plans: a 10% reduction in the revenue forecast
contained in the business plan, with variable costs adjusted accordingly, would not change the
conclusions of the Group's analysis.

Consequently, none of the sensitivity tests reduced the value in use of any of the CGUs to below their carrying
amount.

method or non-consolidated as it is the group’s responsibility to cover those losses if needed.

**_Other provisions_**

All disputes (type, amounts, procedure and level of risk) are identified by the Legal Department of the group
which ensures regular monitoring. The amount of provisions for the claims result from a case by case analysis,
depending on the positions of the litigants, on the estimation of the risks by the group’s legal advisors and on
first instance decisions, if any.

By nature, some provisions are based on estimates and assumptions without considering a precise deadline
for the corresponding cash outflows.

to minority shareholders (for the share to be settled within one year) and short-term debt related to long term
incentive plan.

**5.7.17. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities**

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statement are categorized
within the fair value hierarchy:

   - level 1: fair value based on quoted prices in active markets;
   - level 2: fair value measured using observable market inputs (other than the quoted market prices
included in Level 1);
   - level 3: fair value measured using unobservable market inputs.

The fair value of financial instruments is determined using market prices resulting from trades on a national
stock exchange or over-the-counter markets. When no market price is available, fair value is measured using
other valuation methods such as discounted future cash flows.

In any event, estimates of market value are based on certain interpretations required when measuring
financial assets. As such, these estimates do not necessarily reflect the amounts that the Group would receive


-----

or pay if the instruments were traded on the market. The use of different estimates, methods and assumptions
may have a material impact on estimated fair values.

The Fair value of financial assets and liabilities as of December 2022 can be analyses as follows:

      - Acquisition of Beyond shares (not consolidated as of end of December 2022) for €(30)m (see
note 5.7.5 - non current financial investments)


-----

In 2021 net investment in financial assets mainly include the variation in current account with entity
consolidated under equity method.

**5.8.5.** **Income tax paid**

Income tax paid is excluding the effect of tax credit benefit as they are stated within working capital effect
according to Group accountings methods. It means a cash out in the line “income tax paid’’ can be offset by
an opposite variation in the line “Changes in working capital”.

**_5.9. Objectives and strategies regarding financial risk management_**

The main financial instruments of the group include bank borrowings (including a €170m multi-currency
revolving credit facility not drawn as of December 31, 2022) and bank overdrafts.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide the group with the financial means necessary
for its activities. The group has various financial assets, such as trade receivables, cash and
short-term deposits, which are directly generated by its operations.
The group's strategy was, and remains, not to do any trading on derivative instruments.

The main risks resulting from the financial instruments of the group involve liquidity risk, interest rate risk,
exchange risk and credit risk. The risks of the entities of the group are managed by each entity according to
the group’s strategy and in accordance with the Company’s instructions.

**_Liquidity risk_**

The group maintains adequate reserves of cash and short-term deposits to satisfy its liquidity needs.
Besides, the group implemented several liquidity concentration pools around the main business regions
(Europe, US, UK & Scandinavia). Over the period, approximately 86% of group’s revenue is covered by such
mechanisms. Therefore, the organic growth of the group, its working capital needs as well as its financing
commitments (including payment of earn-out debts or put option debts) are notably ensured by operating
cash flows generated by the business units.

As part of its financing, Banijay Group is subject to financial covenants when the RCF is drawn at more that
40%. As of December 2022, although the RCF is not drawn, such financial covenants are satisfied.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The group exposure to the risk of interest rate fluctuations is mainly related to:

The $460m term loan B. This loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR (1 month) plus 3.75% per annum,
with a 0.0% Libor floor. On this specific loan, Banijay has taken out an interest rate hedge by means
of an interest rate swap exchanging the variable rate for a fixed rate of 1.4%.


-----

The €453m term loan B. This loan bears interest at a rate of EURIBOR (3 months) plus 3.75% per
annum, with a 0.0% Euribor floor.
On this specific loan, Banijay has taken out an interest rate hedge by means of an interest rate capping
the variable rate to 0.0%.
The €170m (equivalent) multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility. Considering the relatively stable level
of EURIBOR over the recent period, the group regards the related interest rate risk as remote.

**Total** **(4)** **62** **(1)** **58**

**_Foreign currency risk_**

The foreign subsidiaries of the group operate essentially on their own territory and sales or purchases within
the group are not significant; as a result, the transactional foreign exchange risk is limited.

For the group, the main currency risk is a translational foreign exchange risk, mostly linked to USD and
GBP:

As of December 31, 2022, the percentage of sales carried out in US dollars represented 20.8% of the
consolidated turnover. A decrease of 5% (resp. an increase of 5%) of the US dollar foreign exchange
rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue of €(32) million (resp. €35 million) and an
impact on the consolidated equity of €25m (resp. €(28)m)
As of December 31, 2022, the percentage of sales carried out in GB pounds represented 19.4% of the
consolidated turnover. A decrease of 5% (resp. an increase of 5%) of the GB pounds sterling foreign
exchange rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue of €(30) million (resp. €33 million)
and an impact on the consolidated equity of €5m (resp €(6)m)

According to IFRS 9 the impact of premium/discounts of forward contracts and the time value of the
option are recognized in the other comprehensive income.

The underlying of those instruments replicates the terms of the hedged item and hence qualifies for
hedge accounting.


-----

**Credit risk**

Credit risk occurs if a party to a transaction is unable or refuses to fulfil its obligations, causing a financial loss
to the group. The group deals only with recognized and creditworthy third parties.
Receivables are monitored regularly, so that the group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.

**_5.10._** **_Off -balance-sheet commitments_**

**Statutory auditor’s report on the consolidated financial statements**

To the President,

**_Opinion_**

In our capacity as statutory auditor of Banijay Group and in an accordance with your request in connection
with the shareholders’ agreement, we have audited the consolidated financial statements of Banijay Group
and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position and notes
to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the consolidated financial statements of this
period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional
measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for
companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties
on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also
had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.

These financial statements were approved by the President.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the
consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2021, and of its consolidated financial
performance and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the international
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International
_Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA_
Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial
statements in France, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**_Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the consolidated Financial_**
**_Statements_**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for
such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to
liquidate the Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

**_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the consolidated Financial Statements_**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

� Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.

� Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

� Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

� Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Entity to
cease to continue as a going concern.


-----

� Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

� Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain
solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.

**_Restriction on Use of our Report_**

This report is addressed to the President of the Entity. We assume or take no responsibility in respect
of a third party which may use this report.

This report shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with French law. The courts of France
shall have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any claim or dispute concerning the engagement letter or
this report, and any matter arising from them. Each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
object to an action being brought in any of those courts and to claim that the action has been brought
in an inconvenient forum or that those courts do not have jurisdiction.

-----

**_5.2. Significant events_**

**_Integration plan_**
As part of the Endemol integration process, the global reorganization plan launched in July 2020 was still in
progress in 2021. The consecutive restructuring costs impact a large part of the other non-current operating
expenses.
Many assessments (tax, human resources, legal, intellectual property, finance…) have been done in the major
territories.
The target is to reflect the operational organization in the legal structure.

**_COVID19_**
As at December 2021, despite new lockdown during the first quarter in some countries (UK, France…) the
activity of production has not been highly impacted and the operating entities act to include the additional
COVID costs in the budget of production to be agreed by the Broadcasters.

Nevertheless, depending on the evolution of the sanitary situation and on local governmental rules, potential
future measures may impact the activity within the division in the next coming months.

**_Long-term incentive plan_**
Following the acquisition of ESG, a new Long-term incentive plan (LTIP) was implemented in 2021. The plan is
a cash-settled share-based payment and has two vesting periods: a first period of 4 years (2021 – 2024) and a
second period of 8 years (2021 – 2028). The target of this plan is to retain key talents for the combined group.

This new LTIP is starting on January 2021. At the end of 2021, the vested portion of the plan was recognized
proportionately based on actual 2021 performance of the entities.

The Banijay phantom shares LTIP implemented in 2017 is expected to be terminated accordingly, the
beneficiaries still employed in the Group are then be offered to join the new combined LTIP. As a consequence,
the former Banijay phantom shares LTIP has not been reassessed since 31 December 2020, except (a) for some
employees having not wished to join the new plan and therefore remained incentivized under this plan and
(b) the remaining acquired phantom shares that have been reassessed based on the Banijay Group shares
market value at year end.

**_Foreign exchange impact_**
Foreign exchange can significantly impact the net income of the group at year end. A large part is due to the
US Dollar variation against Euros.

In order to prevent any material adverse foreign exchange impact, Banijay has implemented in 2021:

   - Natural hedging in order to limit net income / loss volatility on intercompany long-term loans.
   - Hedging instruments during the first semester of 2021 on part of the $403 million senior secured notes
due 2025 raised by Banijay Entertainment. This entity having functional currency in Euros, the residual
risk of foreign exchange not naturally covered is now hedged under fair value hedge.

**_5.3. Accounting principles and methods_**

All amounts in the consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of euros, unless otherwise
specified. The fact that figures have been rounded off to the nearest decimal point may, in certain cases, result
in minor discrepancies in the totals and sub-totals in the tables and/or in the calculation of percentage
changes.

**5.3.1.** **Compliance with IFRS**

The consolidated financial statements of the group for the twelve months’ period ended December 31, 2021
have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) applicable at that
date, and the relevant interpretation standards (SIC/IFRIC) registered by the European Commission and in
force at such date, which, for those relevant to the Company, do not present any difference with the
accounting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

**New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the group from January 1, 2021**

The following new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are mandatory for
January 1, 2021 or later reporting periods and have not been adopted early by Banijay:

  - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2

  - IFRIC agenda decision issued in April 2021 related to IAS 19 Employee Benefits—Attributing Benefit to
Periods of Service considers the periods of service.

  - IFRIC agenda decision issued in March 2021 related to configuration or Customization Costs in a Cloud
Computing Arrangement (IAS 38) relating to the customer’s accounting for costs of configuring or
customizing the supplier’s application software in a Software as a Service (SaaS) arrangement.

These standards did not have a material impact on Banijay in the current reporting period.

**_Standards and interpretations that are not yet effective have not been applied by anticipation by the_** **_group_**

The group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but
is not yet effective.


-----

**5.3.2.** **Main estimates and accounting assumptions**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the group requires the management to use certain
estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the carrying amount of revenues, costs, assets, and
liabilities. The main estimates and assumptions relate to (i) the valuation and useful lives of audiovisual rights,
(ii) the valuation of goodwill, (iii) the amount of provisions for risks and other provisions in relation with the
group’s activity, (iv) the calculation of debt related to earn outs on acquisitions, (v) the estimate of debt
resulting from put options in favour of minority shareholders, and (vi) the assumptions used for share-based
payments.

The features of main accounting methods, judgements and other uncertainties which affect the application of
these accounting methods, as well as the sensitivity of the results to changes in the conditions and
assumptions, are factors to be taken into account while reading these financial statements, as the outcomes
of these estimations will, by definition, rarely equal the actual figures.

There has been no significant change in the main estimates and accounting assumptions of the group over the
period.

_Goodwill impairment_

The group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if goodwill
has to be impaired. The latest impairment review was performed in December 2021. This requires the
recoverable value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated, to be measured. The
group mainly estimates the recoverable value through its value-in-use. The latter is determined by the
management through a projection of expected future cash flows that are discounted at an appropriate rate.

_Content assets depreciation_

The group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if the
content assets presented in the balance sheet have to be impaired. The carrying value of these assets is
compared to the net sales forecast of the said format over a maximum period of 10 years.

_Earn-out payments / put option rights in favour of minority shareholders_

Following external growth transactions, the group can be committed to pay former/minority shareholders
either earn-outs or further acquisition price pursuant to put options on their remaining shareholding,
depending on future profits. As long as there is no lock up mechanism, related debts are accounted for in the
balance sheet at their present value. This liability is re-measured at each reporting period end in accordance
with the contractual arrangements (at fair value or at present value if fixed price) and, in the absence of any
guidance provided by IFRS, with a counterparty in net finance costs, in the Consolidated financial Statements.

_Share-based payments_

Share subscription, purchase options, phantom shares as well as free shares have been granted to certain
employees of the group. The value of these plans depends on future profits of the relevant subsidiaries as well
as on the equity value of the group.


-----

**5.3.3.** **Summary of key accounting methods**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and those of its
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures on December 31, 2021. The financial statements of main
subsidiaries are prepared on the same accounting period as that of the Company, using homogeneous
accounting principles.

All balances, transactions, revenues and expenses, intra-group profits and losses resulting from transactions
with subsidiaries are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the group acquires control. They continue to be
fully consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The results of the operations of subsidiaries acquired
or sold during a given year are recognized in the consolidated results from the date of acquisition or up to the
date of divestment.

Non-controlling Interests represent the portion of profit or loss and the net assets not owned by the group in
a given subsidiary. They are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss as well as in equity in the
consolidated balance sheet, separately from the equity attributable to the shareholders of the group.

**Current / non-current distinction**

According to IAS 1 "Presentation of financial statements", the assets and liabilities are classified as current
when their recoverability or their payment is expected no later than 12 months from the closing date, with
the exception of deferred taxes which are shown as non-current assets and liabilities.

**Consolidation scope and methods**


_Subsidiaries_


In accordance with IFRS 10, the subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date when the group acquires the
control over the subsidiary. Under this standard, the group controls a subsidiary if and only if all the conditions
below are met:

� Having power over the investee, i.e. the group has existing rights that gives it the ability to direct the
relevant activities (the activities that significantly affect the subsidiary's returns)


� Having exposure, or rights, to variable returns from the involvement with the subsidiary


� Having the ability to use its power over the subsidiary to affect the amount of the group's returns.


When minority shares are subject to put and call options that give Banijay Group a present ownership on the
underlying shares, no non-controlling interest are recognized in Banijay Group’s consolidated financial
statements related to those minority shares. The group recognises a financial liability corresponding to the
expected present value of the debt that will be paid to the holders following the exercise of those put and call
options.


_Joint ventures and associates_


Joint ventures are the companies in which the Company exercises a joint control. Associates are investments
in which the Company exercises a significant influence, i.e. it has the power to participate in the financial and
operational decisions but does not have control. The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures


-----

and associates using the equity method.


Under this method, interests in associates and joint ventures are recorded in the balance sheet at acquisition
cost and are increased or reduced by the group’s share in the entity’s net assets, post-acquisition. Goodwill
relating to acquired associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment and
is not depreciated.

The statement of profit or loss reflects the group's part in the results of operations of the related entity.
Significant profits and losses resulting from transactions between the group and the associates and joint
ventures are eliminated up to the percentage of interest in the entity.

The percentage of legal interest held by the group in the consolidated companies as well as the consolidation
methods are disclosed in Note 5.15 ‘Consolidation scope’.

**Foreign currency translation**

The consolidated financial statements are established in euro, which is the functional and presentation
currency of the group.


_Translation of foreign-currency denominated transactions_


Each entity determines its own functional currency. The items of each entity's financial statements are
measured using the functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded initially at the
exchange rate of the functional currency prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedging rate, if applicable.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate of the
functional currency at the closing date and the resulting exchange differences are recognized in the statement
of profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are reported
using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the initial transactions.

Long-term monetary assets held by an entity of the group in a foreign subsidiary for which a settlement is
neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, are a part of the net foreign investments. Thus,
pursuant to the provisions of lAS 21 "The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates", corresponding
exchange rate differences are entered into “other comprehensive income” until the date the investment is
disposed of. Otherwise, the exchange differences are recorded as profit or loss.

Likewise, gains or losses exchange differences relating to intercompany loans that are hedging instruments for
net investments abroad, as provided for by IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments " are recognized as Other
comprehensive income.


_Translation of subsidiaries’ foreign-currency denominated financial statements_


Assets and liabilities, including goodwill of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euro at the official exchange
rate prevailing on the balance sheet date and their statement of profit or loss is translated at the average
exchange rate over the period considered. The resulting exchange differences are booked directly to equity in
a separate heading denominated "Foreign currency translation reserve". When a foreign entity is sold, the
exchange differences accumulated in the “foreign currency translation reserve” allocated to the entity are
transferred to profit or loss.

**Intangible assets**


-----

Intangible assets include:
� format rights acquired from a third party or through business combinations. They can be commercially
exploited either through internal use, i.e. the production of television programs by a group entity, or
through external use, i.e. the sale or licensing to third parties,

� audiovisual rights, or catalogues, referred to as the group’s library of finished programs, whether acquired
or internally developed, for which the group has legal right to distribute and to receive revenue from the
distribution of the rights,

� production contracts or client contracts, acquired through business combinations, for the production of
television programs, TV movies, or cinematic movies,

� fictions in progress: costs incurred for fiction productions that are not yet finalized and not delivered to
the client at the closing date, and for which (i) the group retains the IP and (ii) the group expects significant
further IP revenue.


� other intangible assets: rights for the movie adaptation of books, software, etc.


Initial recognition


Initial recognition of intangible assets is at cost, except for those acquired in a business combination, which
are recognized at fair value.


Depreciation & amortization


Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses.


Audiovisual rights are considered to have a definite useful life.


Intangible assets are depreciated based on the consumption of the associated economic benefits and on the
remaining useful life of the asset. Hence, audiovisual rights are depreciated on an accelerated basis following
the decline in the net value of the asset following its initial broadcasting by the clients.


Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are depreciated:


� Catalogue & formats: on a straight-line basis between a period of 6 to 10 years


� Client contracts: on a straight-line basis over the contract duration


Software assets are depreciated over their estimated useful life (between 1 and 5 years).


The depreciation period and the amortization method are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits
embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the depreciation period or method.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at their acquisition cost, less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of such fixed assets.
The residual value, the useful life and depreciation methods of the fixed assets are reviewed and adjusted, if
necessary, at each financial year-end.


-----

**Leases**


_Right-of-use assets_


The group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying
asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets
includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or
before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the group is reasonably certain to
obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-ofuse assets are subject to impairment.


_Lease liabilities_


At the commencement date of the lease, the group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value
of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including insubstance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an
index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also
include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the group and payments
of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the group exercising the option to terminate. The
variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense in the period on
which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease
commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The interest used at
the inception of the contract will be the same for the whole life of the lease term aside if there are
modifications in contract terms such as a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease
payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.


_Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_


The group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of equipment (i.e., those
leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a
purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office
equipment and cars that are considered of low value.

Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the lease term.


_Significant judgement in determining the lease term of contacts with renewal options_


The group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods
covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by
an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

The group has the option, under some of its real estate leases to lease the assets for additional terms of several
years. The group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to


-----

renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal.
After the commencement date, the group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in
circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew
(e.g., a change in business strategy).

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

The recoverable amount of intangible assets, goodwill and tangible assets is tested for impairment as soon as
external or internal signs of impairment losses exist, such signs being reviewed at each closing date (sector
ratio declining, strong overall decrease in the business relating to the cash generating unit, fall in activity with
a major customer of the cash-generating unit...).

If applicable, the recoverable amount of the asset is tested for impairment to determine whether there is an
impairment loss.


Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, this test is performed at least once a year.


If appropriate, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the net book value of the asset exceeding the
recoverable amount (mostly measured through the asset’s value-in-use).

The recoverable value of the assets to which it is possible to directly attribute independent cash inflows is
assessed on a stand-alone basis. The other assets are grouped within the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to
which they belong in order to estimate their value-in-use. A CGU is defined as the smallest group of assets that
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.

Banijay’s CGU are managed through two operating segments as defined by IFRS 8. These correspond to our
two specific trades: Production and Distribution.

Production segment is split by geographical segments:
. CGU 1: UK – USA / LATAM – Australia – India – Israel


. CGU 2: Nordics – Netherlands – Belgium – Germany – Poland – Russia


. CGU 3: France – Spain – Italy – Portugal


Distribution
. CGU 4: Distribution / Rights

The goodwill from significant acquisitions (Zodiak Media in 2016 and Endemol Shine Group in 2020) have been
allocated to different CGUs according to the territories and taking into consideration the similarities between
the different markets. Currently, Banijay Group management considers 4 CGUs as described above.

The value-in-use of an asset or a CGU is measured by the method of discounted cash flows, based on
projections of future financial cash flows over the next 4 years. Forecasts are derived from plans presented
and approved by the Chairman and the Supervisory Board of the Company. A long-term growth rate is applied
to project cash flows after the fourth year.

By assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted; the discount rate is a post-tax
rate and reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset.

Where an impairment loss is recognized, it is accounted for directly in the statement of profit or loss under
a specific heading.


-----

Impairment losses recognized for goodwill can never be reversed.


The value of assets, other than goodwill, for which an impairment loss has been recorded, is reviewed at
each closing date for the purposes of reversing the impairment loss, if necessary. Where a reversal occurs,
it is recorded as profit or loss. In such a case, the book value of the asset can be increased up to its
recoverable value. After reversing the impairment loss, the book value cannot exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined, net of amortisation or depreciation, had no impairment loss been
recognized for the asset in prior years.

**Financial instruments**


Financial instruments consist of:


� **Financial assets, including other non-current assets, trade receivables, other current assets, cash**
management assets and cash and cash equivalents;

� **Financial liabilities, including long- and short-term borrowings and bank overdrafts, accounts and**
notes payable and other current and non-current liabilities;


� **Derivative instruments**


**Financial instruments (assets and liabilities) are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position**
at the fair value on initial recognition, plus in the case of an asset that is not subsequently recognized at fair
value through profit or loss, transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of that asset.

They are subsequently measured at either fair value (result or other comprehensive income) or amortised
costs, depending on their nature.

**Amortized cost corresponds to the initial carrying amount (net of transaction costs), plus interest calculated**
using the effective interest rate, less cash outflows (coupon interest payments and repayments of principal
and redemption premiums where applicable). Accrued interest (income and expense) is not recorded on the
basis of the financial instrument’s nominal interest rate, but on the basis of its effective interest rate.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability
settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.


**_Financial assets_**


The classification of a financial asset in each of these categories depends on the management model applied
by the enterprise and the characteristics of its contractual cash flows.


Transactions relating to financial assets are recorded at settlement date.


_Debt instrument at amortised cost_


These financial assets are initially recognized at their fair value to which is added directly attributable
transaction costs and, then at amortised cost at each closing date, applying the effective interest rate method.

This category of assets includes trade receivables and other debtors, loans and deposits, receivables attached
to participating interests, cash and loans to associates or non-consolidated entities. In practice, trade
receivables are measured to the amortised cost method, even though they may be subject to an assignment
of receivables, for example, in the context of factoring.


-----

_Equity instrument at fair value through OCI_


The group elected to classify irrevocably its non-listed equity investments under this category as it intends to
hold these investments for the foreseeable future. There were no impairment losses recognized in profit or
loss for these investments in prior periods.


_Impairment testing of debtor financial assets_


The group reviews if, at the closing date, a debtor financial asset or a group of debt financial assets is likely to
suffer an impairment loss based on both the expected credit loss approach and when there is an objective
indicator of loss.

In practice, given the weak level of loss incurred on prior years’ receivables, the expected credit loss approach
does not have any significant impact.

If there is an objective evidence that debtor financial assets carried at amortised cost or at fair value through
OCI should be impaired, the amount of the loss is estimated by difference between the book value and the
discounted future cash flows such as expected (excluding future probable and not actual credit losses). The
discount rate used is the initial effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial
recognition of the asset). The book value is reduced through the use of an allowance account. The amount of
the loss is recorded as profit or loss.

If, subsequently, the impairment decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring
after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment will be reversed. The reversal of
an impairment loss is recognized as profit or loss, as long as the book value of the asset does not exceed its
amortised cost at the date the loss allowance is reversed.

With respect to receivables, a loss allowance is recorded when there is objective evidence (probability of
insolvency or severe financial difficulties of the debtor) that the group will be unable to recover the balance in
accordance with the initial payment conditions. The book value of the receivable is reduced by way of an
allowance for loss. Impaired receivables are derecognized when they are considered as uncollectible.


**_Financial liabilities_**


Financial liabilities are divided into two categories: financial liabilities at amortised cost and financial liabilities
at fair value through profit or loss.

The financial liabilities of the group mainly consist of liabilities valued at amortised cost. Among them are loans
and similar debts including:


� Credit lines from banks and other production financings;


� Bank overdrafts;


� Borrowings;

� Lease debts;


� Bonds and Secured Notes.


The category of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss includes liabilities that should have been
explicitly designated at initial recognition by the group of which earn out and Put over minority interest.


-----

_Interest-bearing debts and borrowings_


All loans, and debts are recognized initially at the fair value of the consideration received, less costs directly
attributable to the transaction.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing liabilities and debts are evaluated at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method.

Costs directly attributable to the issuance of debt are deducted from liabilities and are amortised over the life
of the debt, as a component of the effective interest rate.

**Derecognition of financial instruments (assets and liabilities)**
Financial instruments (assets and liabilities) are derecognized when the related risks and rewards of ownership
have been transferred, and when the group no longer exercises control over the instruments.

Gains and losses are recognized as profit or loss when assets or liabilities are derecognized using the model of
amortised cost.


**_Derivative financial instruments_**


The group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts, options and interest rate
swaps to cover its risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. These
derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on the date on which they are contracted.
They are then re-estimated at their fair value at each closing date. Derivative financial instruments are
recognized as assets in the balance sheet when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is
negative.

For derivatives that meet the criteria of hedge accounting, gains or losses related to change in the fair value
of derivatives during the financial year are accounted for in “other comprehensive income” in case of cash
flow hedge or through P&L in case of Fair Value hedge. For derivatives that do not meet the hedge accounting,
they are recognized directly as profit or loss.

The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to the forward exchange rates
applicable to contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is
determined by reference to the market values of similar instruments.

The fair value of financial instruments that are traded on active markets is determined at each closing date by
reference to the market quotations or transaction prices. Transaction costs are not taken into account.

For instruments that are not traded on an active market, fair value is determined using appropriate valuation
techniques. These may include:
� Transactions entered into under normal market conditions between knowledgeable and willing parties;


� reference to the present fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same;


� discounted cash flows or other valuation methods.


**Contract balances**

If accrued revenue constitutes an unconditional right to payment or consideration, i.e., if the passage of time
is sufficient for payment of the consideration to fall due, the accrued revenue will constitute a receivable. In


-----

all other cases, it constitutes the contract assets.


Revenue accruals are classified in “Trade and other receivables” since accrued revenue constitutes an
unconditional right to a consideration.

Advance payments received from customers and deferred income are the contract liabilities. They are
classified in “Other current liabilities”.

**Inventories**

Inventories relating to work in progress are valued at production cost. They represent outstanding production
of audiovisual programs, excluding fictions for which (i) the group retains a part of the IP and (ii) expects
significant IP revenues, that are not finalised and not delivered to the client at closing date. In the case that
production losses are anticipated, a provision for losses on onerous contract is accounted for, after inventories
have been written off.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and short-term deposits include liquid and available bank accounts subject to limited changes in fair value
as well as short-term deposits whose initial maturity is less than three months.

For the needs of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are composed of the
cash and cash equivalent as defined above reduced by bank overdrafts.

**Provisions**


Provisions are recorded only if:


� the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; and


� it is likely that an expenditure will be required to settle the obligation; and


� a reliable estimate can be made as to the amount of the payment obligation.


The charges relating to provisions are accounted for as profit or loss, net of any contingent reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a discount pre-tax rate
that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the obligation. When discounting, the increase in the
provision due to the passage of time is recognized in net financial income (loss).


_Pensions and other defined post-employment benefit plans_


The group’s obligations under defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are
computed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The actuarial valuation involves
making assumptions such as discount rates, retirement date, staff turnover, future increases of wages,
mortality rates and future pension increases.

For these post-employment benefit plans, the actuarial gains and losses are immediately and entirely
recognized in other comprehensive income with no possibility of recycling in the income statement.


-----

Past service costs are immediately and fully recorded in the income statement on acquired rights as well as on
future entitlements.


The effect of discounting of the provision are presented in the net financial income (loss).


_Other provisions_


All disputes (type, amounts, procedure and level of risk) are identified by the Legal Department of the group
which ensures regular monitoring. The amount of provisions for the claims result from a case by case analysis,
depending on the positions of the litigants, on the estimation of the risks by the group’s legal advisors and on
first instance decisions, if any.

By nature, some provisions are based on estimates and assumptions without considering a precise deadline
for the corresponding cash outflows.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in a contract with
a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognizes revenue when it
transfers control of a product or service to a customer.

The revenue from ordinary activities is recognized as soon as the economic benefits of the transaction will
probably benefit the Group, the amount is reliably measured, and it is likely the amount of the transaction will
be recovered.

Revenue recognition is based on the delivery of performance obligations and an assessment of when control
is transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognised either when the performance obligation in the contract
has been performed (‘point in time’ recognition) or ‘over time’ as control of the performance obligation is
transferred to the customer.

Customer contracts can have a wide variety of performance obligations, from production contracts to format
licences and distribution activities. For these contracts, each performance obligation is identified and
evaluated.

The transaction price, being the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled under the contract, is
allocated to the identified performance obligations. The transaction price will also include an estimate of any
variable consideration where the Group’s performance may result in additional revenues based on the
achievement of agreed targets such as audience targets. Variable consideration is not recognised until the
performance obligations are met.


_Production revenues (from producing television programs)_


Production revenues are recognized when the programs are delivered to the client. Standard criteria to


determine that the performance obligations have been fulfilled and revenue can be recognized are:


� in most cases: client's acceptance document (i.e. delivery notice signed / approved by the client, …)


� delivery of a certain number of episodes


In case of partial delivery of the same program over several periods of time (series, etc...), revenue, costs and


-----

margin are recognized according to episodic deliveries.
Production revenues do not include grants, subsidies and co-producers’ contributions. These are presented
as a reduction of cost of sales.


_Distribution revenues (from the sale of finished programs and formats)_


Distribution revenues are recognized when the rights are transferred to the client:


� on the basis of a signed contract or a deal memo, and


� when the related rights are opened, and


� for the full revenue (revenues are not spread over the licensing period), as it is an access to right since
there is limited ongoing involvement in the use of the licence following its transfer to the customer.


_Revenues from other rights and services_


Other rights and services include merchandising, music rights, other ancillary revenues and digital services.


Merchandising revenues are recognized when the rights are transferred to the client:


� on the basis of a signed contract or a deal memo, and


� when the licensing period begins, and


� for the full revenue (revenues are not spread over the licensing period).


Minimum guarantee revenues are recognized as revenue when the above criteria are met, and further variable
payments are recognized when received.

Revenues from music rights are recognized as revenues when received based on royalties’ statements (output
method).

Revenues and costs related to the rendering of services are recognized on completion of the service rendered
as long as they can be estimated reliably.

When the outcome of the transaction cannot be estimated reliably, revenue shall be recognized only to the
extent of the expenses recognized.


**Principal vs agent consideration**


The group is considered as principal in most of its “performance obligation”.


In the course of its business, the group resells finished tape or formats purchased from third parties. Given it
obtains the right to distribute the content, Banijay usually controls the licence.

The distinction between agent and principal has an impact on the presentation of revenue, which is recognized
as follows:

- on a gross basis when the group is a principal;

- net of the cost of sales when the group is an agent.

**Production costs**

Production costs are net of co-producers’ contributions, grants and subsidies.
They mainly include the costs of scripts, actors, directors, rental of equipment, technical staff, participants,


-----

hosts, sets, format fees, etc.


Until programs are delivered, related production costs are capitalized in work in progress for non-scripted
programs and as intangible assets for scripted programs for which (i) the group retains the IP and (ii) the group
expects significant further IP revenue.

At revenue recognition date, the production costs of non-scripted programs are expensed in the income
statement.

The production costs of scripted programs for which the group retains the IP and expects further significant IP
revenue are amortized as production costs in the statement of profit or loss using the ultimate revenue
method. The cumulated amortization is calculated at the end of a given year as follows:


Production costs x (actual cumulated revenue / total estimated revenue of program).


The total estimated revenue of a program is the sum of actual cumulated revenue of the program and the
program’s future revenue forecast. Depreciation for a current year is calculated by difference with cumulated
depreciation of previous years, if any. An impairment is booked if the net value of the program is higher than
the future revenue forecast.

Initial depreciation of a scripted program is expensed at delivery while the remaining value is depreciated
when the subsequent distribution revenues are recognized.


_Grants and subsidies_


Grants and subsidies are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and
all attached conditions will be fully complied with.

Grants and subsidies which are strictly related to the financing of a given program are deducted from
production costs. When they relate to an asset, grants and subsidies are directly deducted from the carrying
amount of the asset and released to the depreciation and amortization calculated on the net amount over the
useful life of the asset.

All other grants and subsidies (such as government grants not strictly related to a program) are recognized as
“Other operating income” when granted.

**Other non-current operating income and expenses**

These comprise income and expenses that are both unusual in nature and significant in terms of value at the
consolidated level. The group presents such income and expenses separately in the statement of profit or loss
in order to facilitate the understanding of the recurring operating performance.

**Long term incentive plan and employee benefit resulting from business combinations**


Long term incentive plan


Long term incentive plan (LTIP) includes share-based payment plan both phantom shares and free shares, that
have been granted to certain employees of the group and are settled in cash or equity, and some other long
term incentive plan usually based on the performance of one or several entities.

Most of those schemes are based on the local value creation of the entities in accordance with formulas mostly


-----

based on operating KPI (such as operating profit) in which the beneficiaries of the plan are rendering services.

The group revaluates at each reporting date the fair value of the services that have been rendered to date by
the beneficiaries of the plan and the resulting expense is recorded under staff costs.


Several plans have been granted to certain key employees of the group. Main plan are disclosed here after:


. Perimeter and Group LTIP, granting phantom shares over a period of 4 years (2021 – 2024) and 8 years of
vesting (2021 – 2028).

Perimeter LTIP is based on the operating performance of each entity belonging to the plan. The value creation
compared to a floor will generate phantom shares of Banijay Group to the beneficiaries. Group LTIP is based
on the fair market value of Banijay Group share value. Beneficiaries will receive phantom shares of Banijay
Group.

The phantom shares value is mainly driven by the Banijay Group share value and is assessed by external
financial experts on a regular basis. Those phantom shares enable the beneficiaries to benefit from the value
creation of Banijay group shares.


. Free shares plan.


Employee benefits resulting from a business acquisition arrangement
The Group generally prospects, identifies and acquires companies that create high value. It also looks for the
opportunity to secure acquisitions of companies held by talented managers with the strategy of maintaining
and incenting such managers after closing.
In this context, the transaction is often accompanied by an employment agreement or a service agreement
between the acquiree and the manager, pursuant to the closing. Share purchase agreements may also specify
restrictions on the acquisition price, on the potential earn-outs or on the remaining minority interest options
in case of early departure of the manager. These restrictions may be:

- a reduction in the acquisition price,



- a forfeiture of earn-outs,



- a reimbursement of significant parts the paid amounts,



- a call option on minority interests held by the manager at a price less than the fair value


These contingent consideration arrangements aim at compensating former owners of the business acquired
for future services and shall be recognized as a separate transaction as required by IFRS 3.
Depending on the description of the contingent consideration, those transactions are recognized in
accordance with IFRS 2 (cash-settled share-based payment) or IAS 19 (long-term incentives):

- When the terms of the agreements provide the possibility to deliver equity instruments to the

manager, or if the price is based on the fair value of the equity instruments, the grant is measured at fair value
(determined by an independent expert) in accordance with IFRS 2;

- In any other case, the grant is measured on the basis of the expected discounted cash outflow in

accordance with IAS 19. The measurement is usually supported by business plans.
A liability is recognized for the goods or services acquired over the vesting period based on the fair value of
the liability. At each reporting date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the liability is
remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the year.
When the consideration has already been paid, this amount is initially recognized as an asset. Subsequently,
this arrangement is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as an asset or as a liability,
depending on the relationship between the manager’s performance and the payment.


-----

**Tax**

_Current tax_
Tax receivables or tax payables for the current period and prior periods are estimated at the amount that is
expected to be received from or to be paid to the tax administration. Tax rates and tax laws used in order to
estimate the tax receivable or the tax liability are those which have been enacted at closing date.
Current income taxes pertaining to items recognized in “other comprehensive income” are recorded in the
same category and not as profit or loss.

_Deferred tax_
Deferred taxes are accounted for using the liability method for all temporary differences between the carrying
amount recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position and the tax bases of assets and liabilities,
except for non-tax-deductible goodwill. Deferred taxes are determined based on the way in which the group
expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities using the tax rates that are
expected to apply in the year the asset will be realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws)
that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are offset when they have the same maturity and
relate to the same taxable entity. They are classified in the statement of financial position as non-current
assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which deductible temporary differences or tax losses and tax credit carryforwards can be
utilised.

**_5.4. Clarifications on put options accounting treatment_**

Put options over minority interest in the context of a business combination were used to be treated as part of
the consideration transferred irrespective of the existence of lock-up mechanism. Recent clarifications on such
schemes lead to conclude that in some of the existing agreements with minority interests such instruments
include a lock-up mechanism that should be considered as a transaction that remunerates employees or
former owners of the acquired company for services rendered rather than a consideration transferred in a
business combination. Minority interests shares not linked to a lock-up mechanism remain treated as a put
option over minority interest.

**_5.5. Segment information_**

**5.5.1.** **Reporting by operating segment**

**5.5.1.1.** **Definition of group operating segment**

According to IFRS 8, an operating segment is a component of an entity that (i) engages in business activities
from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by
the entity’s chief operating decision maker to decide how resources should be allocated to the component
and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available.

As of December 31, 2021, Banijay Group recognizes three main operating segments:

   - Production activity, which encompasses all production entities of the group. These entities form a
single operating segment as the nature of their business is similar across the group
(mainly ‘the production of audiovisual contents’) and they present similar long-term economic
characteristics.
   - Distribution activity, constituted by Banijay Rights and its subsidiaries, whose activity differs from the
rest of the group as those entities are in charge of selling finished tapes and formats.
   - ‘Others’ segment is mainly composed of holdings.

Compared to last year, most of the “others” segment was reclassified to the “production’’ segment.

**5.5.1.2.** **Disclosure of operating segment information**

**_5.6. Follow up of prior year acquisitions and changes in consolidation scope_**

**_Endemol Shine Group (ESG)_**

An update of the opening balance of Endemol Shine Group was made as of June 2021 and resulted in additional
goodwill of €22m prospectively recognized.

**Acquisitions during the period**

_Acquisition of DMLS T.V._

In July 2021, Banijay France acquired 70% of the share capital of D.M.L.S TV, which is a local leader in music
and entertainment titles. DMLS TV is behind some of France’s most notorious brands, including La Chanson
Secrète (The Secret Song), La Chanson Challenge (The Celebrity Song Challenge), La Lettre (with Carson) (Yours
Sincerely) and Duos Mystères (Mystery Duets).

_Acquisition of Southfield B.V_

In July 2021, Endemol Shine Nederland B.V. acquired 85.8% of the shares of Southfields B.V., leading Dutch
sports producer. From football, cycling and Formula 1, to hockey, volleyball and basketball, Southfields will
deliver coverage, registrations, talk shows and documentaries across a wide-spanning local client base.

The purchase price allocation of all those acquisitions is still under progress at the date of issuance of these
consolidated financial statements.

_Other acquisitions_

In 2021, the group acquired Monello in France and two entities in Germany.

The total amount of goodwill recognised in the year in respect of these acquisitions was €17m. The purchase
price allocation of all those acquisitions is still under progress at the date of issuance of these consolidated
financial statements.

In April 2021, Endemol Shine OpCo Holding BV acquired the remaining share capital of Endemol Israel Ltd and
now hold 100% of the share capital.

**L’Officina**

In April 2021, Banijay Italia bought the shares held by the external partner and now holds 100% of the share
capital.

**Cape Cross**

In August 2021 Brainpool bought the shares held by the external partner and now holds 100% of the share
capital.

**EWT Holding**

In December 2021, Banijay Benelux Holding bought the shares held by the external partner and now holds
100% of the share capital. EWT Holding (The Netherdlands) used to own a majority part of the shares of the
Russian entity Weitmedia. After this transaction, Weitmedia shares had been transferred to Banijay
International (a French entity).

The cumulated cash out impact of those transaction amounted to €8m and the counterpart is booked as debit
in equity.

**_5.7. Notes to the statement of profit or loss_**

**5.7.1.** **Revenue**

Revenue reached €2,756m over the twelve-months period ended December 31, 2021 against €1,596m as of
December 31, 2020. This revenue essentially corresponds to the production and sale of audiovisual programs.

The strong variation is due both to a scope effect following the acquisition of Endemol Shine Group that was
included for 6 months only in 2020, and to organic growth.

**Remaining performance obligation**

The remaining performance obligation corresponds to firm commitments (or closed sales).

The transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations (unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied)
as at 31 December totalized €1,602m including €1,404m within one year and €198m beyond one year
(respectively in 2020 €1,643m including €1,458m within one year and €185m beyond one year).

The remaining performance obligations should essentially cover the revenue to be recognized for
undelivered productions and for sales of finished tapes/formats for which the rights are not opened.

**5.7.2.** **Operating expenses**

Main operating expenses corresponds to a part of the production costs for €1,026m (€646m in 2020), and
general and administrative expenses for €56m (€35m in 2020).

Production expenses also includes staff costs (cf. note 5.7.3) and some costs booked in external expenses such
as short term leases or consultancy fees.


-----

**5.7.3.** **Staff costs**

Staff costs consist of salaries and remuneration of staff, including payroll expenses, as well as
expenses related to share-based payments schemes, i.e.:

� expenses related to plans allocating free shares,
� expenses related to phantom shares plans indexed on the increase in equity value.
� expenses related to commitment to purchase shares of minority shareholders (put option) or to pay
earn out based on level of performance and conditioned to the existence of lock up mechanism.

Expenses related to long term incentive plan (LTIP), mostly share-based payments, included within staff costs
amounted to €60m in the twelve-months period ended December 31, 2021, compared to €20m in December
2020 restated. The change from the previous year is due to two main factors: the implementation of a new
LTIP plan (2021 – 2028) and operational performance improvements. As described in note 5.3.3 § Long-term
incentive plan, most LTIPs are contractually based on one or more financial performance indicators.

**5.7.4.** **Other non-current operating income (expenses)**

Other non-current operating income (expenses) amount to c. €(26)m as of December 2021 and mostly
corresponded to restructuring costs, acquisition costs, other litigations raised during the period (€34m); offset
by a capital gain of +€8m on investment in associates.

As of December 2020, other non-current operating income (expenses) amount to c. €(52)m and mostly
corresponded to restructuring and acquisition costs.

**5.7.5.** **Cost of net debt**

The cost of net debt as of December 2021 is mostly related to:

   - The interests’ expenses of the Senior secured Notes and the senior notes, issued on February 11, 2020
   - The amortization of transaction costs related to the financing structures, and
   - The interests of local production financing facilities.

Cost of net debt amounts to €(124)m in the twelve-months period ended December 31, 2021 compared to
€(107)m as of December 31, 2020.

Other finance income and costs are composed of:

   - The discounting and revaluation expenses related mainly to the earn out, put option debts and Long
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). These liabilities are discounted based on a 9.31% discount rate in 2021
(2020: 9.31%). This line also includes some discounting effect on revenue with regards to the financing
component under IFRS 15.

   - Exchange gain and losses are mainly related to €3m unrealized and realized foreign exchange effect
(2020 : €47m). 2020 impact was mainly driven by USD change effect of underlying USD403m bonds
for €28m. Since 2021, to prevent any material adverse foreign exchange impact, Banijay has
implemented natural hedging in order to limit net income / loss volatility on intercompany long-term
loans (see note 5.2 – significant events).

   - The gain and losses on derivatives correspond to the mark to market variation of foreign exchange
hedging instruments: €2m (€2m in 2020).

The income tax for the twelve-months period ended December 31, 2021 amounts to €(26)m compared to
€(16)m in the twelve-months period ended December 31, 2020.

The group’s profit is realised in several countries. The tax rate is subject to changes in actual local tax rates
and depends on the relative contributions of the different countries in the group's profit.

Banijay Group’s effective tax rate is 20,3% for the twelve-months period ended December 31, 2021 compared
to 32.3% in 2020 (restated). The reconciliation of France legal tax rate with effective tax rate is presented as
follows:

**5.7.8.** **Share of profit of associates and joint ventures**

The share of profit from associates and joint ventures corresponds to the portion of profit or loss achieved
during the twelve-months period ended December 2021 by entities consolidated under the equity method (Cf
5.16)

**5.7.9.** **Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing attributable profit by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding treasury shares on a pro rata basis.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking into account all financial instruments carrying deferred rights
to the parent company's capital, issued either by the parent company itself or by any one of its subsidiaries.
Dilution is calculated separately for each instrument, based on the conditions prevailing at the end of the
reporting period and excluding anti-dilutive instruments.

**Impairment test**

The group has assessed if goodwill had to be impaired. The recoverable value of the cash generated unit to
which the goodwill has been measured based on the following key assumptions:

� WACC (after tax): 9.31 %
� Infinite growth rate: 2.00%
� The financial projections are derived from the 2022 Budget and 2023 – 2025 business plan.

The projections include estimates for the cost savings that have been realized and are to be realized from
several cost savings initiatives. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties as
they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Accordingly,
actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may differ from those assumed in the forwardlooking statements.

**Results of impairment tests**

Based on the impairment tests conducted, no impairment needs to be charged against goodwill, intangible
and tangible assets.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

The sensitivity of impairment tests to adverse, feasible changes in assumptions is set out below:

- reasonable sensitivity to changes in the discount rate: a simulated increase of up to 1 percentage point
in the discount rate used would not change the findings of the Group's analysis;

- reasonable sensitivity to changes in the long-term growth rate: in a pessimistic scenario where the
long-term growth rate is reduced by 0.5 percentage points, the value in use of each CGU would still exceed its
carrying amount;

- reasonable sensitivity to changes in the business plans: a 10% reduction in the revenue forecast
contained in the business plan, with variable costs adjusted accordingly, would not change the conclusions of
the Group's analysis.

Consequently, none of the sensitivity tests reduced the value in use of any of the CGUs to below their carrying
amount.

Inventories and work-in-progress mainly correspond to costs incurred for the production of non-scripted
programs (or scripted programs for which the group does not expect subsequent IP revenue) that have not
been delivered at reporting date, as the group recognizes its production revenue upon delivery of the materials
to the customer.

Employee defined benefit obligation (post-employment benefits)

The group is part of some defined benefit schemes by contributing to pension plans and other
post-employment benefits mainly in France and Italy.

Provision for financial risks

Provision for financial risks mainly corresponds to the negative equity of the entities consolidated under equity
method or non-consolidated as it is the group’s responsibility to cover those losses if needed.

Other provisions

All disputes (type, amounts, procedure and level of risk) are identified by the Legal Department of the group
which ensures regular monitoring. The amount of provisions for the claims result from a case by case analysis,
depending on the positions of the litigants, on the estimation of the risks by the group’s legal advisors and on


-----

first instance decisions, if any.

By nature, some provisions are based on estimates and assumptions without considering a precise deadline
for the corresponding cash outflows.

**5.8.14. Other long-term liabilities**

Other non-current liabilities mainly correspond to

   - the share due in more than one year related to earn-outs payable for acquisitions and to put options
granted to minority interests (€35m as of Dec. 2021 vs €43m as of Dec. 2020);
   - debts related to cash-settled share-based payments as well as to profit-sharing plans in favour of
certain employees of the group on the other hand (€65m as of Dec. 2021 vs €30m as of Dec. 2020);
and
   - the negative fair value of some derivate instruments (€4m as of Dec. 2021 vs €20m as of Dec. 2020).
   - Other long term employee benefits, other than post-employment benefits (see note 5.8.13, such as
long-term paid absences, jubilee or other long-service benefits, and deferred remuneration. At 31 Dec.
2021, they amount to €5m.

**5.8.15. Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 can be broken down as follows:


**December 31,**

**Other current liabilities** **749** **551**

The €661m deferred income as of December 2021 mainly relates to undelivered programs that are work-inprogress (or intangible assets-in-progress) and that have already been invoiced. Those deferred incomes
correspond to the contract liabilities (under IFRS 15).

The €2m of other derivatives relates to foreign exchange and interest hedging instruments or assimilated
derivative instrument

Other current liabilities mainly correspond to earn-out commitments on acquisitions, to put options granted
to minority shareholders, for the share to be settled within one year, and Hedging Derivatives.

**5.8.17. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities**

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statement are
categorized within the fair value hierarchy:

    - level 1: fair value based on quoted prices in active markets;

    - level 2: fair value measured using observable market inputs (other than the quoted market prices
included in Level 1);

    - level 3: fair value measured using unobservable market inputs.

The fair value of financial instruments is determined using market prices resulting from trades on a national
stock exchange or over-the-counter markets. When no market price is available, fair value is measured using
other valuation methods such as discounted future cash flows.

In any event, estimates of market value are based on certain interpretations required when measuring
financial assets. As such, these estimates do not necessarily reflect the amounts that the Group would
actually receive or pay if the instruments were traded on the market. The use of different estimates,
methods and assumptions may have a material impact on estimated fair values.

For financial assets and liabilities booked at amortised cost, fair value is not provided since the net book value
represents a reasonable estimate of their fair value. Bonds instruments that booked at amortised costs are
listed. Their fair value amounts as follow at 31 Dec. 2021:

   - €575m Senior Secured notes: index 100.377, that is to say a fair value of €577.2m
   - $403m senior secured notes: index 102.375, that is to say a fair value of $412.6m (€364.8m equivalent)

**_5.9. Notes to the statement of cash flows_**

**5.9.1.** **Other adjustments**

Other adjustments in the statement of cash flows mainly include the restatement of:

   - IFRS 2 expenses,
   - discounting and revaluation income or expenses,
   - unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses,
   - certain elements that are restated from the cash flows from operating activities to be presented under
investing or financing activities (e.g. transaction costs).

**5.9.2.** **Consequences of changes in consolidation scope**

Consequences of changes in consolidation scope in 2021 consist mainly in :

   - the total consideration paid to finance acquisition of the period amounts to €(6)m net of +€2m cash
acquired
   - Cash-out related to earn-out and put options €(15)m.
   - Sales of Eredivisie for €5m

Consequences of changes in consolidation scope in 2020 consisted mainly in :

   - the total consideration paid to finance ESG acquisition for €(1 940)m net of +€84m cash acquired
   - Proceeds from the sale of Eredivisie and Wiederman for €26m.

   - Cash-out related to earn-out and put options for €(18)m.

**_5.10._** **_Objectives and strategies regarding financial risk management_**

The main financial instruments of the group include bank borrowings (including a €170m multi-currency
revolving credit facility not drawn as of December 31, 2021) and bank overdrafts.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide the group with the financial means necessary
for its activities. The group has various financial assets, such as trade receivables, cash and
short-term deposits, which are directly generated by its operations.

The group's strategy was, and remains, not to do any trading on derivative instruments.

The main risks resulting from the financial instruments of the group involve liquidity risk, interest rate risk,
exchange risk and credit risk. The risks of the entities of the group are managed by each entity according to
the group’s strategy and in accordance with the Company’s instructions.

_Liquidity risk_

The group maintains adequate reserves of cash and short-term deposits to satisfy its liquidity needs.
Besides, the group implemented several liquidity concentration pools around the main business regions


-----

(Europe, US, UK & Scandinavia). Over the period, approximately 87% of group’s revenue is covered by such
mechanisms. Therefore, the organic growth of the group, its working capital needs as well as its financing
commitments (including payment of earn-out debts or put option debts) are notably ensured by operating
cash flows generated by the business units.

As part of its financing, Banijay Group is subject to financial covenants when the RCF is drawn at more that
40%. As of December 2021, although the RCF is not drawn, such financial covenants are satisfied.

_Interest rate risk_

The group exposure to the risk of interest rate fluctuations is mainly related to:

� The $460m term loan B. This loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% per annum, with a 0.0%
Libor floor. On this specific loan, Banijay has taken out an interest rate hedge by means of an interest
rate swap exchanging the variable rate for a fixed rate of 1.4%.
� The €453m term loan B. This loan bears interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus 3.75% per annum, with a
0.0% Euribor floor.
On this specific loan, Banijay has taken out an interest rate hedge by means of an interest rate capping
the variable rate to 0.0%.
� The €170m (equivalent) multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility. Considering the relatively stable level
of EURIBOR over the recent period, the group regards the related interest rate risk as remote.

**Total** **(21)** **18** **(0)** **(4)**

_Foreign currency risk_

The foreign subsidiaries of the group operate essentially on their own territory and sales or purchases within
the group are not significant; as a result, the transactional foreign exchange risk is limited.

For the group, the main currency risk is a translational foreign exchange risk, mostly linked to USD and
GBP:

� As of December 31, 2021, the percentage of sales carried out in US dollars represented 16.3% of the
consolidated turnover. A decrease of 5% (resp. an increase of 5%) of the US dollar foreign exchange
rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue of €(21) million (resp. €24 million).
� As of December 31, 2021, the percentage of sales carried out in GB pounds represented 18.6% of the
consolidated turnover. A decrease of 5% (resp. an increase of 5%) of the GB pounds sterling foreign
exchange rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue of €(24) million (resp. €27 million).

According to IFRS 9 the impact of premium/discounts of forward contracts and the time value of the
option are recognized in the other comprehensive income.

The underlying of those instruments replicates the terms of the hedged item and hence qualifies for
hedge accounting.

_Credit risk_

Credit risk occurs if a party to a transaction is unable or refuses to fulfil its obligations, causing a financial loss
to the group. The group deals only with recognized and creditworthy third parties.

Receivables are monitored regularly, so that the group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.

**_5.15._** **_Events after the reporting period_**

**Covid**

The on-going Covid-19 outbreak and resulting measures taken by various governments to contain the virus
may negatively affect our business in 2022. The scale and duration of this pandemic remaining uncertain and
the situation evolving daily, the magnitude of its impact is under permanent scrutiny.

The liquidity risk is secured following the refinancing operations in February 2020 on one hand, and through
the work of the group and its banking partners and various financing resources made available by the
government on the other hand.

**Montmartre Films (previously Légende Films) - France**

In December 2021, Banijay signed a firm commitment to take over Montmartre Films (formerly Légende
Films), a French based scripted production entity managed by Alain Goldman via the production entities,
Pitchipoï Productions and Montmartre Films (previously Légende Films). The closing was performed in January
2022.

Channeling the arrangement through regional outpost, Banijay France, the deal will see the group and Alain
Goldman come together to grow a pipeline of premium quality scripted IP, in the form of both series and
feature-length films.

**Groelandia - Italy**

In February 2022, Banijay Italia signed a firm commitment to take over Groelandia, an Italian based scripted
production company. Groenlandia has established itself on the Italian and international scene with many
successful films.

**Russian / Ukrainian crisis**

The group is closely monitoring developments in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The group has
limited exposure to the Russian market. In 2021, its Russian subsidiaries generated a net revenue contribution
of €36m (1.3% of total sales in 2021) and current operating profit of €1.7m (0.7 % of total current operating
profit in 2021).
