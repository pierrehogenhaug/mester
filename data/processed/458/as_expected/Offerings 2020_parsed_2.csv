The Unaudited Interim Banijay Financial Statements have been reviewed by our statutory auditors, Ernst & Young et Autres; and - the audited historical consolidated financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer and the notes thereto, prepared in accordance with IFRS, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (the “Audited Banijay Financial Statements” and, together with the Unaudited Interim Banijay Financial Statements, the “Banijay Financial Statements”). The Audited Banijay Financial Statements have been audited by our statutory auditors, Ernst & Young et Autres. Their audit reports are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, together with the Audited Banijay Financial Statements. On February 23, 2016, we completed the Banijay Zodiak Merger, a reverse merger pursuant to which Banijay Holding, the holding company of the Group prior to the Banijay Zodiak Merger, was merged into Zodiak, which was renamed Banijay Group S.A.S. upon completion of the reverse merger. However, under reverse acquisition accounting principles, Banijay Holding is treated as the accounting acquirer and Zodiak is treated as the accounting acquiree. As a result, the audited consolidated financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes (i) the operations of the accounting acquirer (Banijay Holding) from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and (ii) the operations of the legal parent (the Senior Notes Issuer, formerly Zodiak) from February 23, 2016, the date of the completion of the Banijay Zodiak Merger, to December 31, 2016. See note 6.2 to the Audited Banijay Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Therefore, the Senior Notes Issuer’s financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, do not fully represent the results of operations and financial condition of the entire business and the comparability of these financial statements with the financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, presented elsewhere in this offering memorandum, is limited. See “Banijay’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors _Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements.”_ Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. We have adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, which has an impact on our reported consolidated assets, liabilities, income statement and cash flow statement. In implementing IFRS 16, we prepared the Unaudited Interim Banijay Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. Accordingly, our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (which were prepared after the first application of IFRS 16) are limited in comparability to our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 (which were prepared before the first application of IFRS 16). See “Banijay’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16.”_ Unless otherwise indicated, and other than for percentages and ratios, the financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, represents the mathematical calculation of subtracting the applicable financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, from the applicable financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018, and adding the applicable financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, without accounting for the difference regarding the first application of IFRS 16. The financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only.

This reclassification aims at fully presenting the impact of the functional allocation implemented for the first time in the Audited Endemol Shine Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. On October 17, 2016, the Target completed bankruptcy proceedings with respect to CORE Entertainment Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries. See “Endemol Shine’s Business—Legal Proceedings—Core Media Group.” As a result, CORE Entertainment Holdings Inc.’s shares in CORE Entertainment Inc. were cancelled such that CORE Entertainment Holdings Inc. no longer owns CORE Entertainment Inc. or any of its subsidiaries nor has the right to manage their businesses. The loss of control over these businesses triggered their immediate deconsolidation from the consolidated statement of financial position of the Target as of the date of loss of control, which was October 17, 2016. Therefore, the audited consolidated financial information of the Target as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the operations of CORE Entertainment Inc. and its subsidiaries from January 1, 2016 to October 17, 2016, such that the comparability of these financial statements with the financial statements of the Target as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, presented elsewhere in this offering memorandum, is limited.

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. Endemol Shine has adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, which has an impact on its reported consolidated assets, liabilities, income statement and cash flow statement. In implementing IFRS 16, Endemol Shine prepared the Unaudited Interim Endemol Shine Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. Accordingly, Endemol Shine’s results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (which were prepared after the first application of IFRS 16) are limited in comparability to its results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 (which were prepared before the first application of IFRS 16).

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. These non-IFRS measures and ratios, such as EBIT, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, cash conversion ratio, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA margin, direct gross profit, direct gross profit margin and other measures and ratios are not measurements of our or Endemol Shine’s performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit for the year or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. The non-IFRS measures we present may also be defined differently from the corresponding terms under the Indentures. The non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or a substitute for, profit/(loss) for the period or other financial statement data presented in our or Endemol Shine’s consolidated financial statements as indicators or financial performance. Some of the limitations of these non-IFRS measures are that: - they do not reflect our or Endemol Shine’s cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our or Endemol Shine’s working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our or Endemol Shine’s debt; - they do not reflect our or Endemol Shine’s tax expenses or the cash that we or Endemol Shine may be required to use in order to pay taxes; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our or Endemol Shine’s statements of cash flows; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we or Endemol Shine consider not to be indicative of, respectively our or Endemol Shine’s ongoing operations; xxiv ----- - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA-based measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; - some of the exceptional items that we or Endemol Shine eliminate in calculating certain EBITDAbased measures reflect cash payments that were made, or will be made in the future; and - certain adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA contain estimates that our management or that of Endemol Shine believes reflect the underlying results of operations and are therefore subjective in nature. Furthermore, you should carefully consider the risks and limitations of the non-IFRS financial measures, as they are based in part on our management’s or Endemol Shine’s management’s assumptions regarding the future impact of actions that have not yet been implemented. For example, there is a risk that the synergies that we seek to achieve, including in connection with the Endemol Shine Acquisition, may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe and that the magnitude of cost savings may be less than expected.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

458_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.2,,"We are the largest independent content producer based on revenues and content production hours for the year ended December 31, 2018. We create, develop, sell, produce and distribute television formats and programs and digital content for a wide range of customers, and we believe we are positioned at the forefront of content production and distribution as a premier home for the industry’s leading on- and off-screen talent. We produce both scripted and non-scripted content across all major genres, including reality shows, entertainment and talk shows, game shows, factual entertainment and drama, through approximately 120 production entities across 22 countries and with content in 19 languages. We have produced successful, long-running formats and programs such as Big Brother, MasterChef, Peaky Blinders, Survivor, Temptation Island, Keeping Up with the _Kardashians, Wife Swap, Black Mirror, Don’t Forget The Lyrics!, The Secret Life of 4 Year Olds, Versailles, Fort Boyard, Money Drop, Deal or No Deal and Occupied. Our broad brand portfolio and large creative platform_ position us to continue to create, nurture and drive new formats for broadcasters and digital platforms. We generate revenues through the sale of the programs we create and produce and the distribution of formats and programs for which we hold intellectual property rights and/or rights to revenues generated by these formats and programs. We approach broadcasters with our concepts and formats, timelines and budget plans for production and broadcasters typically fully fund the production budget before production begins. Broadcasters and digital platforms pay us a fee in consideration for our delivery of the programs. For non-scripted programs, this fee generally finances the production costs and comprises the profit we generate from non-scripted programs. On the other hand, financing scripted programs generally requires several financing sources, consisting primarily of commitments from broadcasters (several broadcasters can be part of the financing plan) and other secondary sources, such as tax credits and rebates, and financing from distributors, including from time to time our distribution subsidiaries, through a distribution advance. We begin the production process only once a format has been developed, programs based on such format have been sold to a broadcaster or digital platform and financing has been fully arranged. As such, our business model is largely derisked and is characterized by a highly variable cost structure. Our successful formats generally continue to be aired for multiple seasons and are often rolled out across multiple geographies, providing a strong source of recurring revenues and cash flow visibility. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated 79.0% of our pro forma production revenues from returning programs. We employ creative talent to develop original formats and produce television programs based on our analysis of trends in the industry and the demands of customers and, thanks to the scope of our business following the Endemol Shine Acquisition, we have access to a wide variety of industry-leading talent and highquality creative content. We own intellectual property rights to a broad and diversified portfolio of formats and programs, with our content library including approximately 85,000 hours of content. We estimate that we generated the majority of our pro forma production revenues from our owned IP formats for the year ended December 31, 2018. We retain (either through full ownership or control pursuant to distribution contracts with third-party producers) the intellectual property rights to most of our formats and programs. Such IP rights are assets that we generally distribute internationally and from which we seek to generate secondary revenues, such as licensing of distribution rights to broadcasters and digital platforms and sales of finished tapes and branded 1 ----- content, to supplement the initial production revenue. We distribute and license the majority of the content we own and control through our key distribution subsidiaries, Banijay Rights Limited and Endemol Shine International Limited. Our customers include broadcasters, such as BBC, Fox, TF1, France Télévisions, Channel 4 and MTV, and digital platforms, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Facebook Watch, Google and Viaplay. No single broadcasting group accounted for more than 8.5% of our pro forma production revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our customer base includes approximately 500 traditional broadcasters and digital platforms as of December 31, 2018, including over 300 customers in Europe and the United States, our main geographic markets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Combined Group generated pro forma revenues of €2,602.7 million, with production revenues accounting for €2,147.3 million (82.5% of our pro forma revenues), distribution revenues accounting for €290.9 million (11.2% of our pro forma revenues) and secondary revenues accounting for €164.5 million (6.3% of our pro forma revenues).

The global television industry was valued at approximately €386 billion in 2018. The television industry’s key revenue streams (pay TV subscriptions, advertising and license fees) are all expected to continue growing over the 2019 to 2023 period, and subscription-based video on demand (“SVOD”) revenues are also expected to continue growing at a CAGR of approximately 13.9% from 2019 to 2023. The share of SVOD players in content spend is expected to grow to approximately 20% in 2025. We benefit from a well-diversified content offering, which allows us to take advantage of growth in our industry and markets (which is largely a 3 ----- function of television viewership levels and viewing patterns), and to deliver formats suitable for a wide range of clients in the markets in which we operate. Viewership levels drive our customers’ revenues and therefore impact their level of spending on the content we produce.

See “Industry.” We produce content through approximately 120 production entities, and the Combined Group has access to markets in which Banijay did not previously operate, such as Mexico and Brazil. We benefit from broad geographical coverage and portfolio diversification, resulting in significant ability for our formats and programs to travel through our production companies and be distributed through our distribution business. We have developed best-in-class internal format-sharing practices and, due to our size and decentralized organizational structure, we believe we can tailor our formats and programs to our target customers more easily than other large production groups. If we produce a successful program in one country, we can often replicate and develop the underlying format in other countries. In 2018, 61 of our formats had traveled to a different country following initial airing in the country where the format was originally developed, with 44 Endemol Shine formats having traveled to one or more new territories and approximately 17 Banijay formats having traveled to over ten countries. We are an independent producer, exclusively focused on providing innovative content to our broad customer base, which includes traditional broadcasters and digital platforms. Most of the largest television content producers in the world (in terms of revenues) are affiliated with an entertainment group or a distribution network. Our independence enables us to serve customers, without the limitations faced by controlled producers regarding, for example, the content, style and format of their production. Our independence allows us to innovate, deliver original, differentiated programs and work with a large pool of creative talents and clients. In addition, we also benefit from regulations in certain of the markets in which we operate, including those that require broadcasters to commission a certain percentage of their programs from independent producers, such as the Directive (EU) 2018/1808 concerning the provision of audiovisual media services requiring broadcasters to allocate at least 10% of broadcasting time to programs created in Europe by independent producers. In addition, our main shareholders, LOV Group and Vivendi, are industry experts who understand the television production and distribution business and are focused on developing original content. We believe that the size of the Combined Group enables us to invest in a broad range of creative talents around the world and to allocate funding to the production and development of more new formats and pilots, providing us with more opportunities to create successful new formats and programs.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Content production revenues have grown in recent years and are projected to continue growing at a CAGR of approximately 4.7% from the period between 2020 to 2025, underpinned by (i) the rise of OTT platforms (particularly global SVOD players such as Disney+, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video) that drive both supply and demand for content and increase levels of competition between and among broadcasters and digital platforms, as well as total investment in content production, (ii) increasing competitive pressure on broadcasters that pushes them to increase their content investment in order to retain their audiences (particularly vis-à-vis OTT platforms), (iii) growing influence of Asian content markets, particularly as large importers of content from Europe and North America and (iv) continued demand for highbudget drama content, which is a strong driver for viewership. As a large independent producer, we believe we are particularly well-positioned to benefit from these trends. For example, we believe that digital platforms such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Video will demand an increasing amount of new content (notably for non-scripted) in order to reach as many viewers as possible.

Thanks to our portfolio of successful formats and programs that can be adapted to a variety of audiences across multiple geographies, we believe we are well-positioned to maintain and grow our share in our current markets. In addition, our distribution business enables us to license our portfolio of formats and programs around the world, including to customers located in markets in which we do not currently maintain production operations, and generates revenues with high margins due to the relatively limited costs incurred in managing our portfolio of existing formats and programs. We deliver our programs and formats to a large customer base of broadcasters and digital platforms. Certain of our production companies, such as Banijay Production Media, Adventure Line Productions, Bunim/Murray Productions, and Endemol Shine UK Ltd. have produced television content for more than 20 years and we benefit from long-standing relationships with broadcasters and other customers. We believe that our ability to propose original formats with a cost-efficient production process has increased customer loyalty. In addition, we often have multiple contracts, which address multiple formats and geographies, with individual customers. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2018, our largest broadcasting customer represented 8.5% of our pro forma production revenues and our five largest broadcasting customers collectively represented 30.0% of our pro forma production revenues.

For example, Banijay successfully sold its first original series Pine Gap to Netflix in Australia and is currently producing Young Wallander, a prequel to its Swedish crime format Wallander for Netflix in the United Kingdom, while Endemol Shine successfully sold Peaky Blinders and Black Mirror to Netflix. In addition, while the television content production market remains fragmented, we operate a fully integrated business, which enables us to both produce and distribute our programs and formats.

Banijay has historically focused on producing non-scripted content across various genres, such as reality shows, game shows, entertainment and talk shows, but has recently diversified its business to include increased production and distribution of scripted content. Endemol Shine already has significant expertise in producing successful scripted programs, such as Peaky Blinders and Black _Mirror, and non-scripted programs, such as Big Brother and MasterChef. Non-scripted programs are generally_ less capital-intensive and more profitable than scripted programs because they have shorter production cycles and their budgeted production costs are covered in full before production begins. Viewership levels of non-scripted programs, our core business, have increased in the last decade. For example, viewership of MasterChef has increased in existing and new territories and has benefitted from new forms of distribution such as digital platforms (including YouTube). In 2019, there were 53 confirmed series of MasterChef, which is the highest number of confirmed series of MasterChef in a calendar year since 2005. Scripted programs, on the other hand, generally require a longer development period and higher production costs, but can generate significant secondary revenues. This is particularly true with respect to secondary revenue potential if such scripted programs are in English because they can often be sold to a broad base of customers around the world, including local and global digital platforms that are increasingly demanding new ready-to-air programs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, non-scripted programs, scripted programs and other programs represented 79.9%, 18.5% and 1.6% of our pro forma production revenues, respectively, which we believe is generally an appropriate mix for the Combined Group although we may seek to slightly increase the proportion of revenue generated by our scripted programs in the coming years.

We_ have increasingly focused on formats that, once produced for one market, can be licensed internationally to reach customers in other markets. For example, we have developed successful international formats, such as _MasterChef. Premiered in 1990, MasterChef was the most traveled food format in the world in 2018 and has_ been sold across over 180 territories, with over 400 series to date. We are the exclusive distributor of MasterChef globally and we license this format to our operating companies and to third-party producers for local adaptations. Other examples of successful formats include our factual entertainment format Wife Swap, which was originally developed in the United Kingdom and is currently airing in 14 countries, and our entertainment format game show All Against 1, which was initially launched in Denmark and has since been adapted in six countries. _Survivor also has a successful 22-year track record and has been adapted in more than 40 countries, with new_ sales of the format in seven new countries in two and a half years. We re-booted our reality show format _Temptation Island and relaunched it in the United States in 2018 and subsequently sold the program in France,_ Spain, Germany and Finland (in addition to Belgium and the Netherlands, where the program was already broadcasted). Our largest and top ten formats were diversified across multiple customers and contributed 8.1% and 24.7% of our pro forma production revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Once we have developed a format in a given country, we have a better understanding of the production process and the associated costs. We also leverage this expertise to assess production costs when negotiating with broadcasters in other countries to adapt the format. We systematically try to retain intellectual property rights to the formats and programs we produce, which is key to maximizing distribution and other secondary revenues. This business model enables us to generate additional revenues from the licensing of the format in other markets as well as from the production of local adaptations of our formats and programs by our other production companies in markets in which we operate. Our revenues from our distribution business complement revenues from sales to broadcasters and digital platforms and generate higher margins because our costs are limited once a format has been developed and a program has been produced. We operate an integrated business with a broad range of resources to create, develop, produce and distribute television content. We have resources dedicated to every stage of the television content production and distribution business. We have key partnerships with successful and creative talents around the world who work with us to produce original content at local and international levels. Our distribution companies then allow us to distribute our formats and programs and monetize our successful formats and programs by generating secondary revenues. As a result, we are able to effectively control costs at each stage of television content development, production, sale and distribution. In addition, we face minimal risk of a loss due to production costs in relation to our non-scripted programs, as broadcasters generally provide full financing for these programs. We have developed various policies at the Group-level to ensure that if one of the formats or programs for which we own or control intellectual property rights is sold in a country in which we have a presence, it must be produced by one of our production companies, which have exclusive access to our catalogue. These policies enable us to maximize the circulation of our formats within the Combined Group and preserve our integrated business model.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

This is higher than the 11.7% average EBITDA margin over the last three years of the producers that we consider to be our main competitors, such as ITV Studios, Fremantle and Red Arrow, as well as other industry players such as LionsGate—Television and MGM Television. Banijay has also maintained strong cash generation, with Adjusted Free Cash Flow ranging from €73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to €98.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Banijay’s average cash conversion ratio (defined as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) for the same period was 67.8%. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, Banijay’s Adjusted EBITDA was €132.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.5%. Following the completion of the Endemol Shine Acquisition, we believe that our cash conversion ratio will normalize in the short-term, supported by low capital expenditures for the Combined Group. We also intend to continue to implement our acquisition schemes based on earn-outs and put options in order to limit our cash interest expense. We believe we have a largely de-risked business model. Our revenue benefits from the longevity of our returning formats, such as Survivor, Wife Swap, Big Brother and MasterChef, with the majority of our formats airing for more than one season, which generates long-term revenue streams and significant visibility into our operating performance as we secure budgeted revenues through contracts signed early in the production process. As demonstrated in the graph below, our business model is also supported by the stable level of content spend, which has been resilient during recent economic downturns, as compared to advertisement spend.

Both Stéphane Courbit and Marco Bassetti have a successful track record of television content production. Since 2007, Banijay has become a leading independent producer of television programs based on revenues. Our management team has a strong track record of delivering on their budget and has demonstrated strong M&A capabilities, successfully integrating new businesses into the Group, such as the acquisitions of Zodiak and Castaway which outperformed the expected synergies and revenue contribution at the time of these acquisitions. In addition, our senior management team is familiar with Endemol Shine, with both Stéphane Courbit and Marco Bassetti having previously held senior positions at Endemol Shine and certain members of Banijay’s local senior management teams having been former managers within Endemol Shine. Furthermore, we benefit from the support of our shareholders, including, DeA and Vivendi, two groups that have invested in the distribution of content and broadcasters. Unlike some of our competitors, the Combined Group is led by industry experts who understand our creative talents and local production managers. This common culture and vision between our management team and our creative talents have allowed us to attract and retain successful managers, employees and partners. For example, some of our key managers and creative talents have managed to enter into framework production agreements with broadcasters, which cover several programs over a number of years and which are usually difficult to obtain from broadcasters. We have entered into earn-out or put option agreements with certain of the founders and key managers of companies we have acquired, to ensure the commitment of local management teams and to discourage their departure by rewarding them based on their respective production companies’ performance. Following the completion of the Transactions, we expect certain key managers of the Combined Group will indirectly own 7.8% of the shares of the Senior Notes Issuer through wholly-owned or majorityowned intermediate holding companies.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, 21.0% and 79.0% of the Combined Group’s pro forma production revenues were generated, respectively, by new programs (first season) and returning programs (more than one season). As of November 2019, Banijay had already contracted approximately 52% of its estimated revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020 and Endemol Shine had already contracted approximately 48% of its estimated production revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020. We only commence the production for a format once a broadcaster or digital platform has agreed to purchase the format and the production costs have been fully funded. We also use the services of a significant number of freelance production artists and technicians depending, in part, on the level of television production activity in which we are engaged. In addition, we attract, retain and incentive talents via long-term incentive plans which are generally contingent and calculated based on the performance of the relevant format over a specified time period. Therefore, our production costs and a significant share of our staff costs are based on our performance and activity levels and are variable in nature. Our fixed costs represented 29.7% of our pro forma operating costs (meaning all costs included in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA) for the year ended December 31, 2018, while Banijay’s and Endemol Shine’s respective fixed costs (meaning all costs incurred independently of the level of activity) for that same period represented 25.0% and 31.7% of operating costs. Including the impact of the synergies expected to be achieved as a result of the Endemol Shine Acquisition, our fixed costs would have represented 27.8% of our pro forma operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, non-scripted programs, scripted programs and other programs represented 79.9%, 18.5% and 1.6% of our pro forma production revenues, respectively. Non-scripted programs are generally less capital-intensive and more profitable than scripted programs because they have shorter production cycles and their budgeted production costs are covered in full before production begins. We believe the Combined Group’s split between scripted and non-scripted content is generally well-suited to our operations, and while we may seek to slightly increase the proportion of revenue generated by our scripted programs in the coming years, we do not expect to invest significantly to develop our scripted content business as we expect that third-party financing sources will largely incur the upfront investment costs and that we will benefit from our existing catalogue’s distribution revenue.

Attracting, cultivating and retaining talents has been, and will remain, critical to our success. We plan to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, particularly for their creative talent. We intend to further strengthen our entrepreneurial culture by continuing to incentivize our local managers to foster the high flexibility, independence and autonomy of each of our subsidiaries. For example, we have implemented a long-term incentive plan that rewards key personnel and talents based both on the performance of their production company and the performance of the Group, which we intend to extend to key talents employed by Endemol Shine (see “Management—Remuneration and Other Benefits”). We have also developed a bonus scheme at the Group-level to incentivize creative talents responsible for the creation and development of successful formats that are adapted in our key markets and have generated a certain production value for the Group, which we intend to adapt for the Combined Group to continue incentivizing format circulation. 9 ----- Following the Endemol Shine Acquisition, we intend to put more focus on retaining key talents than acquiring new talents. In the past, we developed expertise in acquiring and retaining key talent, offering such individuals the possibility of entering into joint venture agreements with us, such as Deepak Dhar, the CEO of Banijay Asia and David Goldberg, the CEO of Banijay Studios North America. This is especially attractive to talents who would like to maintain their independence but are interested in a strong partnership with us, and we expect this to be even more attractive following the acquisition of Endemol Shine. In a joint venture with us, talents benefit from our broad creative network, access to financing, information, contacts and, most importantly, catalogue of formats, our major brands and our distribution capacity. In addition, they may be able to sell us their remaining shareholding once the business has developed successfully because, if a joint venture is successful, we may acquire the remaining share capital in the production company on pre-agreed financial terms while retaining the talents who partnered with us. As of September 30, 2019, Banijay had established five joint ventures with local partners. Joint ventures allow us to be involved in the early stages of potential successes and, in the long term, to secure the possibility of acquiring a controlling interest for a price based on a pre-existing formula that takes into account our investment and support.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, 21.0% and 79.0% of the Combined Group’s pro forma production revenues were generated, respectively, by new programs (first season) and returning programs (more than one season). For example, in 2019, we launched Boyardland in France, an entertainment series based off of our long-running franchise Fort Boyard, and in 2013, we launched the _MasterChef Junior series in the United States, a variation of our successful MasterChef series._ We focus our strategy on developing the most profitable non-scripted formats, such as game shows or talk shows that can be broadcast daily with the potential for high returns, and formats for the most profitable primetime and access prime-time slots. We intend to apply Banijay’s production guidelines for non-scripted formats to Endemol Shine in order to monitor creation risk and maximize cash generation by limiting overhead costs, determining the price of a program based on margins and prohibiting deficit financing or key man clauses. Similarly, we expect the size of the Combined Group to enable us to fund a larger number of high-quality pilots with lower expected risk as these pilots would be amortized on a larger scale. In addition, Endemol Shine benefits from a creative award scheme to incentivize talents to develop successful formats, and we intend to apply these incentives to the Combined Group following the completion of the Endemol Shine Acquisition. We have several entertainment formats in our pipeline that we believe have a strong international appeal because of their subject matter and the current viewing trends and audience demands. These formats include Don’t, a family game show co-produced with actor Ryan Reynolds, and entertainment formats produced by Bear Grylls, which we believe could generate significant production and secondary revenues in the future. Furthermore, we intend to leverage Endemol Shine’s expertise in the scripted business, reflected in successful programs such as Black Mirror or Peaky Blinders, to continue to develop blockbuster formats with high production margins. Having previously invested heavily in creating a strong scripted business and a broad portfolio of established scripted shows and brands, we believe that the Combined Group has more limited exposure to box office failures and will contribute to higher profitability in our production revenues, particularly as we introduce our established business model and best practices to its operations. We produce scripted programs in the majority of the 22 countries in which we operate. While we may seek to slightly increase the proportion of revenue generated by our scripted programs in the coming years, we do not expect to invest significantly to develop our scripted content business, as we expect third-party financing sources will largely incur the upfront investment costs and that we will benefit from the existing catalogue’s distribution revenue. We mainly target scripted programs with high profitability that can run for a long period of time, such as Occupied, or daily soap operas, such as Familie in Belgium and Il Paradiso delle Signore in Italy. We also aim to optimize tax rebates by producing such formats in countries that offer the most significant tax credits and rebates and greatest access to all required resources on a cost-efficient basis. Following the Endemol Shine Acquisition, we intend to retain an increasing portion of the intellectual property rights to our formats and programs, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. 10 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The distribution business of the Combined Group, through Banijay Rights Limited and Endemol Shine International Limited, has been successful in selling or licensing a catalogue of approximately 85,000 hours of content, including to customers in markets where we do not produce content. We also intend to increase the size of our program portfolio to reach new customers in emerging markets, such as India, where we believe there is great potential for growth in terms of viewers and where the same program can be produced for different territories in different languages. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated 11.2% of our pro forma revenues from our distribution business, and formats that have already been developed and produced, together with existing programs, can be distributed with comparatively high margins. Endemol Shine has a successful track record of circulating its formats to multiple territories and we intend to leverage Endemol Shine’s expertise to further increase the value of these blockbuster formats. For example, the format Your Face Sounds Familiar was originally developed by Endemol Shine in Spain in 2011 and led to two spin-off formats, Your Face Sounds Familiar Kids and Your Face Sounds Almost Familiar. The format has been produced in 39 territories, with a strong presence in Central Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America, and 170 series of the program have aired since launch. Furthermore, Endemol Shine’s local managing directors are incentivized to develop adaptable formats in-house with an international appeal that can generate distribution and other secondary revenues. We intend to apply this strategy, as well as Banijay’s proven format-sharing practices, to the Combined Group and to focus on developing know-how in our different markets in order to create traction for an upcoming format developed in another country. For example, we intend to leverage Banijay’s ability to revamp dormant formats, such as the reboot of Temptation Island, in the United States in 2018, then in Germany, Spain and France in 2019, and currently in ten countries. In addition, we intend to develop our relationships with third-party producers to secure the production and distribution rights of premium content even when they are not developed by one of our production companies. We target premium scripted content in the English language, which generally can be easily distributed internationally and is well-suited to the catalogue of many OTT platforms, as well as formatted non-scripted content which can often be adapted by our companies all over the world. We focus on sourcing partnerships and deals that generate positive returns and making selective investments in intellectual property rights and producers that we believe can deliver new long-running formats.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated 6.3% of our pro forma revenues from our secondary revenues. We aim to increase secondary revenues by taking advantage of in-program digital technologies and other features, such as votes, SMS, polling or calls while a program is airing. We also develop sponsorships with on-air partners to integrate product placement in our programs and to supplement broadcasters’ production budgets. In addition, we focus on developing branded content and partnerships with brands to establish content supplier agreements with key global broadcasters. We try to retain ancillary rights when negotiating with broadcasters to be able to develop merchandizing, branded events and experiences and off-air licenses. For example, we have entered into brand licensing arrangements for the program MasterChef _Cruise. We are also able to monetize content with low development costs through digital platforms with live-_ streaming capabilities. Moreover, we monetize content with the development of games based on intellectual property rights which we retain in connection with our formats.

The Endemol Shine Acquisition will increase our international footprint and will place us as a premier home for the industry’s leading on- and off-screen talent. Banijay plans to leverage its management’s collective experience in integrating new businesses, as it did with Zodiak and Castaway which outperformed the expected synergies and revenue contribution at the time of these acquisitions, and rationalizing costs to effectively bring Banijay and Endemol Shine into a single operating group, particularly as Banijay’s senior management team is familiar with Endemol Shine, with both Stéphane Courbit and Marco Bassetti having previously held senior positions at Endemol Shine and certain members of Banijay’s local senior management teams having been former managers within Endemol Shine. Our plan is to (i) define a target structure in each country for business and support functions in order to identify key talents in each territory, (ii) on-board existing clients by showing them benefits and opportunities associated with the Combined Group and pushing our package deals, (iii) incentivize talents in the Combined Group by rolling out Banijay’s long-term incentive plan to Endemol Shine’s talents and retain key industry talents and (iv) integrate and simplify central functions across the Combined Group and implement cash pooling and new tax optimization schemes. We intend to fully achieve approximately €60 million of annualized run-rate cost savings and synergies in connection with the Endemol Shine Acquisition from the start of the third year following the Acquisition Completion Date. Our total estimated cost synergies include (i) operating cost savings of approximately €39.6 million relating to headcount reductions as a result of integrating local management teams in countries where both Banijay and Endemol Shine operate, (ii) indirect cost savings of approximately €18.5 million related to the integration of corporate, IT and other headquarter functions through a shared overhead structure for the Combined Group and (iii) rent-related cost savings of approximately €2.0 million by concentrating operations in the countries where both Banijay and Endemol Shine operate. We expect to incur approximately €59.0 million in estimated one-off costs in the first 24 months following the Acquisition Completion Date to implement synergies from the Endemol Shine Acquisition, including severance costs relating to headcount reductions and termination costs relating to rent and service contracts.

(2) We define EBITDA as earnings before interest and income tax (“EBIT”) for the period, before depreciation and amortization of intangible and tangible assets. (3) EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. (4) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flow or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and differ from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes” and in the Indentures. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA for informational purposes only. There can be no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations for Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions and management estimates. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired businesses or other transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should 38 ----- not be relied upon when making an investment decision. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS.

(b) Our historical consolidated statements of profit or loss for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were prepared under IAS 17, and our historical consolidated statement of profit or loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was prepared under IFRS 16. Depreciation prepared on an IAS 17 basis represents depreciation, excluding depreciation of right-of-use assets that were accounted for as operating leases prior to the first application of IFRS 16. Amortization prepared on an IAS 17 basis represents amortization, excluding amortization of lease premiums which, following the first application of IFRS 16, are included within right-of-use assets on our balance sheet, with depreciation charged accordingly. (c) Represents the portion of EBITDA attributable to the first application of IFRS 16. (d) Represents current impairment losses and provisions, net of reversals, primarily incurred in connection with the depreciation of our intellectual property rights. (e) Represents operating expenses out of the ordinary course of business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, exceptional operating expenses primarily related to restructuring costs in Italy, where we provisioned a potential cash-out related to the requalification of employees with renewed temporary contracts, and in the United Kingdom, where we implemented plans to reduce staff costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and for the year ended December 31, 2018, exceptional operating expenses primarily related to the cancellation of Koh Lanta in France following an incident between two candidates as well as some restructuring and acquisition costs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, exceptional operating expenses primarily related to restructuring costs in France, Italy and the United States, as well as costs related to acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, exceptional operating expenses primarily related to the Banijay Zodiak Merger. See “Banijay’s Business—Employees.” 39 ----- (f) Represents share-based payment expenses in connection with long-term incentive plans entered into with certain key managers, which are multi-year schemes separate from remuneration contracts that are either cash-settled, with phantom shares exercisable after four to eight years, or equity-settled, with free shares granted over the years ended December 31, 2016 to 2025. These sharebased payment expenses are not cashed out in the year. (g) Represents the portion included in our Adjusted EBITDA of the depreciation and amortization of production costs in connection with the production of scripted content, including amortization of fiction productions, provisions for debt (excluding debt allocated to production) and provisions for other liabilities and charges. (h) Represents our estimate of the EBITDA contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, from the acquisition of The Natural Studios, as if the Bear Grylls Acquisition had been completed on October 1, 2018. We have derived this estimated EBITDA contribution in the amount of €10.6 million primarily from diligence reports prepared in connection with the Bear Grylls Acquisition prior to our signing of the Bear Grylls Acquisition Agreement, available management accounts and the budget of The Natural Studios for the year ended December 31, 2019. We incurred an additional €49.9 million of liabilities for earn-outs and put option liabilities in connection with the Bear Grylls Acquisition. (i) Represents our estimate of the EBITDA contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, from the consolidation of Brainpool in the amount of €5.3 million, based on the financial statements of Brainpool for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as Brainpool was fully consolidated with the Group on December 31, 2018, as if the consolidation had occurred on October 1, 2018. (j) Represents our estimate of the EBITDA contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, from the acquisitions of (i) Funwood Media in the amount of approximately €1.5 million, based on the audited financial statements of Funwood Media for the year ended December 31, 2018, (ii) Screen Media in Norway in the amount of €0.7 million, based on the audited financial statements of Screen Media for the year ended December 31, 2018, (iii) Good Times in the amount of €0.9 million, based on the audited financial statements of Good Times for the year ended December 31, 2018 and (iv) ITV Movie, an Italian independent producer of television programs, in the amount of €1.3 million, based on the audited financial statements of ITV Movie for the year ended December 31, 2018, as if each acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2018. (k) Represents our estimate of the EBITDA contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, from the consolidation of Lucky Pics in the amount of approximately €0.7 million based on the audited financial statements of Lucky Pics for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the management accounts of Lucky Pics for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2019, as if the consolidation had occurred on October 1, 2018. (l) Represents our estimated annualized run-rate cost synergies in connection with (i) the acquisition of Screen Media in the amount of €1.2 million, which we expect to realize through operating cost savings and headcount reductions following the integration of corporate and management functions of Screen Media with our existing subsidiaries in Norway, and (ii) a restructuring plan in Italy following the merger of our subsidiaries Magnolia S.p.A. and Dry Media S.r.l., in the amount of €1.0 million that we expect to realize through headcount reductions following the integration of local management teams. These measures have already been implemented. (m) Represents (i) the estimated impact of the application of IFRS 16 on our results for the last quarter of the year ended December 31, 2018 (€3.7 million) and (ii) the impact of the acquisition of IFRS 16 lease liabilities (€0.4 million) in connection with the acquisitions of The Natural Studios, Funwood Media, Screen Media and Good Times and the consolidation of Lucky Pics and Brainpool. (5) Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. (6) Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a performance measure we use and which we believe is used by investors. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is not a defined measure under IFRS. Therefore, Adjusted Free Cash Flow should be viewed as supplemental to, but not as a substitute for, measures presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows, which are determined in accordance with IFRS. As not all companies define Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the same way, Adjusted Free Cash Flow as shown in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Our summary consolidated financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, has been derived from the Audited Banijay Financial Statements, which are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The Audited Banijay Financial Statements have been audited by our auditors and their audit reports are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Our summary consolidated interim financial information as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2019, have been derived from the Unaudited Interim Banijay Financial Statements, which are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The Unaudited Interim Banijay Financial Statements have been reviewed by our auditors and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. We have adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, which has an impact on our reported consolidated assets, liabilities, income statement and cash flow statement. In implementing IFRS 16, we prepared the Unaudited Interim Banijay Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. Accordingly, our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (which were prepared after the first application of IFRS 16) are limited in comparability to our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 (which were prepared before the first application of IFRS 16). The summary consolidated financial information below includes certain non-IFRS measures that we use to evaluate our economic and financial performance. These measures are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those calculated using financial measures that are prepared in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.” You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with the sections “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Financial Information Included in this Offering Memorandum,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Financial Information” and “Banijay’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(2) EBITDA represents profit for the period, before depreciation, amortization, impairment, financial income, financial expense, share in profit of associates and income tax. (3) EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. (4) Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA, as adjusted for exceptional items and other adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA for Endemol Shine as presented in this offering memorandum does not equate to EBITDA before exceptional items as disclosed in the Endemol Shine Financial Statements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flow or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and differ from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in “Description of the Senior Secured _Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes” and in the Indentures. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for informational_ purposes only. There can be no assurance that items Endemol Shine has identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations for Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions and estimates by Endemol Shine’s management. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired businesses or other transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable to Endemol Shine’s consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. Endemol Shine presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes they are helpful to investors as measures of Endemol Shine’s operating performance and ability to service its debt. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Endemol Shine’s operating results as reported under IFRS.

In implementing IFRS 16, Endemol Shine prepared the Unaudited Interim Endemol Shine Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. Accordingly, Endemol Shine’s results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (which were prepared after the first application of IFRS 16) are limited in comparability to its results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 (which were prepared before the first application of IFRS 16). The summary consolidated financial information below includes certain non-IFRS measures that Endemol Shine use to evaluate our economic and financial performance. These measures are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those calculated using financial measures that are prepared in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.” You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with the sections “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Financial Information Included in this Offering Memorandum,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Financial Information” and “Endemol Shine’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Endemol Shine’s historical results do not necessarily indicate results that may be expected for any future period._ 42 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

(2) _Pro Forma EBITDA margin is defined as Pro Forma EBITDA as a percentage of pro forma revenues. (3) _Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flow or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this offering memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and differ from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” “Description of the Senior Notes” and in the Indentures. We present Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA for informational purposes only. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had the Transactions for which an adjustment is made occurred at the dates indicated. There can be no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations for Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions (including the successful implementation of certain initiatives), management estimates and the unaudited management accounts of the acquired businesses. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired businesses or other transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. We present Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt. Pro Forma EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS.

(g) Represents operating expenses out of the ordinary course of business, including for example, exceptional operating expenses related to restructuring and acquisition costs, as well as certain other events, such as the cancellation of Koh Lanta in France following an incident between two candidates. 50 ----- (h) Represents (i) our estimate of the EBITDA contribution of €21.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, from the acquisition of The Natural Studios, Funwood Media, Screen Media, Good Times and ITV Movie, and the consolidation of Lucky Pics and Brainpool, as if each acquisition or consolidation had occurred on October 1, 2018, and (ii) our estimated annualized run-rate cost synergies of €2.2 million in connection with the acquisition of Screen Media and a restructuring plan in Italy following the merger of our subsidiaries Magnolia S.p.A. and Dry Media S.r.l. See “—Banijay’s Summary Historical Financial and Other _Information—Other Financial Data.”_ (i) Represents our estimated annualized run-rate cost synergies in connection with the Endemol Shine Acquisition, which we expect to fully achieve from the start of the third year following the Acquisition Completion Date. We believe that actions taken in each year to implement these annualized run-rate cost synergies will allow us to have an estimated run-rate EBITDA impact of approximately €17.3 million within the first twelve months following the Acquisition Completion Date, approximately €57.0 million in the second year following the Acquisition Completion Date and approximately €60.1 million in the third year following the Acquisition Completion Date. The estimated annualized run-rate impact of these synergies on the Combined Pro Forma Run-Rate EBITDA includes: - Staff synergies of approximately €39.6 million. We intend to achieve these synergies through headcount reductions following an assessment to rationalize our overhead structure and staff and eliminate redundancies created by the integration of Endemol Shine in our operations, particularly in the territories where Banijay and Endemol Shine both operate and require similar corporate, IT and other central functions. - Service contract synergies of approximately €18.5 million through (i) integrating IT systems and other functions across the Combined Group, (ii) rationalizing our use of third-party service providers, including through greater use of in-house production facilities, particularly in the territories where Banijay and Endemol Shine both operate and (iii) leveraging our size to negotiate better pricing for third-party services that we deem efficient or necessary to retain. - Rent synergies of approximately €2.0 million. We intend to achieve these synergies through footprint optimization by sharing facilities in the territories where Banijay and Endemol Shine both operate and leveraging our size to negotiate better rental prices. We expect to incur approximately €59.0 million in estimated one-off costs in the first 24 months following the Acquisition Completion Date to implement synergies from the Endemol Shine Acquisition, including severance costs relating to headcount reductions and termination costs relating to rent and service contracts. We believe that actions taken to implement these annualized run-rate cost synergies will result in one-off costs of approximately €35.5 million in the first twelve months following the Acquisition Completion Date, approximately €23.5 million in the second year following the Acquisition Completion Date and no significant one-off costs in the third year following the Acquisition Completion Date. Although it is our objective to reach the levels of projected synergies reflected above, no assurance can be given that such levels will be achieved in the time frame indicated or at all or that additional unanticipated costs will not arise. We currently estimate the majority of the costs to achieve the anticipated synergies to be personnel reduction and related costs that may be required under the laws of various of the countries where we operate, which we expect to incur within 24 months of the Acquisition Completion Date. In connection with actions we intend to take each year to implement these annualized run-rate cost synergies, we will be required to negotiate severance payments, including pursuant to a collective dismissal procedure provided under applicable regulations in various of the countries where we operate. While we fully intend to observe the relevant legal procedures and requirements and to negotiate in good faith, if we cannot reach agreement on severance payments with such worker representatives or the employees, they may choose to bring administrative or judicial challenges, which could delay or prevent the achievement of our anticipated synergies. We will also be required to pay certain termination and other fees, including those which we may have yet to negotiate, which could delay or prevent the achievement of our anticipated synergies. Our synergy estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and our judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates, including those described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Endemol Shine Acquisition—We may not be able to realize the anticipated _operational efficiencies and cost savings.” See also “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_ (j) Represents (i) the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the results of Banijay for the three months ended December 31, 2018, (ii) the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the results of Endemol Shine for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and (iii) the impact of the acquisition of IFRS 16 lease liabilities in connection with the acquisitions of The Natural Studios, Funwood Media, Screen Media and Good Times and the consolidation of Lucky Pics and Brainpool. (k) Represents an adjustment relating to recurring provisions for bad debt. (l) Represents dividends to Endemol Shine from a Dutch entity in which Endemol Shine holds a minority investment. (m) Represents investments in growth projects, which Endemol Shine recognizes as costs but which Banijay would recognize as capitalized costs that would result in depreciation or impairment depending on the return on investment. (n) Represents synergies and cost savings not yet realized from a restructuring plan of Endemol Shine, which has already been initiated. (o) Represents non-recurring costs incurred by Endemol Shine in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 in connection with the Core Media Group legal proceedings. (p) Represents other adjustments relating primarily to impairment of distribution advances, which Endemol Shine recognizes as cost of sales and which Banijay would recognize in depreciation and amortization, with a depreciation life that is proportionate to the expected revenues. (q) The presentation of Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA is for informational purposes only. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had the Transactions occurred on January 1, 2018. The calculations for Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions and management estimates. Certain of the adjustments to our Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA have been derived from information made available to us in connection with Endemol Shine and are based on certain assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but which may prove to be inaccurate over time, and relate to businesses that we did not own or control at all for the entire duration of the period presented in the table above (in the case of the Endemol Shine Acquisition). 51 ----- We have not completed the Endemol Shine Acquisition and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the Endemol Shine Acquisition within the anticipated timeline, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Endemol Shine Acquisition— _The Endemol Shine Acquisition is subject to certain conditions, uncertainties and risks and, if it is not consummated, the Issuers may redeem their respective Dollar Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes at 100% of the issue price, plus accrued and unpaid interest.” Furthermore, the EBITDA contribution of Endemol Shine for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, may not be_ representative of what the EBITDA of Endemol Shine would have been for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, if such information were available and if the Endemol Shine Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2018.

458_2,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.1,We may not be able to retain key personnel or creative talents or to attract new creative talents.,"Our business and our success have depended and will continue to depend on our creative talents, our management team and other key employees or partners, such as hosts, producers and local managers in our production companies. These individuals possess unique skills that are critical to the creation and production of new formats and programs as well as the operation of our business. The loss or an extended interruption in the services of one or more of our hosts, producers, senior management or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, as demonstrated by the departure of Ana Rosa Quintana, a popular television host in Spain, from Banijay in 2017. Additionally, a limited number of our contracts (including contracts relating to certain of our most important programs or formats, including, for example, Mr. Bean and Money Drop) with broadcasters contain “key man” provisions that would allow the counterparties to terminate agreements early or to take over the production of the programs in case of the departure of a specific host or talent or key people, and any such departure may depend on factors beyond our control. Considerable expertise could be lost or access thereto gained by competitors in the event of the departure of our creative talents. We aim to retain our key managers, hosts, producers and creative talents through various incentive agreements, such as earn-outs or put option agreements, when we have acquired a company from them, incentive plans based on their contribution to the success of the production company, non-compete clauses and exclusivity clauses. However, due to intense competition within the industry, there is a risk of losing creative talents or qualified employees to competitors or being unable to find a sufficient number of appropriate new talents or employees. For example, it may be difficult to replace programs with or produced by Cyril Hanouna or Nagui, two popular television hosts in France, or Bear Grylls. If any famous host were to leave our production companies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, certain of our scripted programs may be dependent on the availability and performances of certain actors, actresses, directors and other creative talents. If we cannot retain these talents or if they cannot continue to work on our programs for any reason, it could have a material adverse effect on the production and distribution revenues from such scripted programs. In addition to retaining talents, our future success depends in significant part on our ability to attract new managers and creative talents as well as contractors and skilled and distinguished freelancers. Competition for highly qualified management executives and creative talents is intense. We may experience difficulties in attracting new personnel, we may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy or we may need to pay higher compensation for employees than we currently expect. A shortage in the availability of qualified personnel and creative talents could limit our ability to grow. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel we need to develop our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Banijay also benefited from the investments and the expertise of Stéphane Courbit, our Chairman, since he founded Banijay in 2007. LOV Banijay, Banijay’s majority shareholder, is beneficially owned by Mr. Courbit, who is involved in the development and the business strategy of Banijay. Additionally, a limited number of Banijay’s key managers and creative talents have a right to terminate their agreements with us in the event Mr. Courbit leaves Banijay. Following the Transactions, Mr. Courbit will continue to own the majority of the 54 ----- Combined Group and to be involved in our business strategy. Therefore, the departure of Mr. Courbit or any of these key managers and creative talents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

This trend is particularly strong in the United States where broadcasters tend to impose a “producer for hire” approach (i.e., the producer is an independent contractor managing the production process, without any intellectual property rights to the program) and where it has become increasingly difficult for producers to retain any intellectual property rights or a share of revenues from future licensing or sale, even when the producer has originally developed the format or the program. In the United States, producers may be required to finance at least part of the program to ensure that they are able to retain intellectual property rights to the format, which is contrary to the market standard of fully funded non-scripted business. In Europe, broadcasters have also started to ask for a share of ownership of the formats or programs when they fully fund the production, whereas in certain countries, such as the Nordic Countries and Italy, according to market practice, broadcasters generally co-own the content. For example, in markets such as Germany, where broadcasters traditionally fully fund the production of programs, we may not be able to retain intellectual property rights over the formats such broadcasters have produced, as such rights would be required by the broadcasters as a condition to funding. This trend is also the general approach of Facebook Watch, Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and Google (which operates Android TV), both in the United States and in Europe, which generally require the transfer of ownership over all rights to the formats and programs that they finance. For example, they may ask for longer license periods in many territories or they may require unlimited runs to air the programs. Broadcasters have become reluctant to share revenues generated by intellectual property rights that they used to share in the past. For example, unlimited VOD rights are now considered to be “primary rights” in many markets and are granted to broadcasters for the entire license period without sharing any additional revenues with the producer. Broadcasters may also require extensive holdbacks to ensure that certain formats will not be used in the market in which they operate for a certain period of time, even after they stop to commission new programs, and may require that none of their local competitors be allowed to capitalize on these formats. When we are not able to retain sufficient ownership of the intellectual property rights of the formats we create and programs we produce, we may lose control over our formats and programs and a portion of the distribution and secondary revenues. While we strive to retain maximum intellectual property rights when negotiating with broadcasters, we may not be able to do so and, if this trend further develops, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.3,Intellectual property infringements may have a material adverse effect on our business.,"Our ability to compete in our industry depends, in part, upon successfully protecting and retaining our proprietary and intellectual property, especially with respect to formats, which are more difficult to protect than rights to a program, because a program is a finished product that has already aired rather than a formalized concept. We protect our intellectual property rights to our formats and programs through available copyright and trademark laws. We then license and distribute these rights to reputable companies in specific territories for limited durations. Despite these precautions, existing copyright and trademark laws offer only limited practical protection for formats in certain jurisdictions. Unlike patents or trademarks for which registration is required, copyright does not require any registration and provides limited protection as it is more difficult to prove and protect, especially for formats. Copyright infringement is particularly difficult to defend in many parts of the world that lack effective copyright and technical protective measures to prove copyright, or that lack effective means for enforcing such measures, including certain jurisdictions in which we operate in Asia. In addition, intellectual property rights may not effectively protect the content we distribute around the world through our distribution business. The interpretation of copyright, privacy and other laws as applied to our content, and piracy detection and enforcement efforts, remain in flux. The failure to strengthen or the weakening of existing intellectual property laws could also make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property and negatively affect its value. It may also be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our formats or portions of our formats without entering into a format license agreement with us or to exploit our programs, or part of our programs, without entering into a license agreement for one of our programs. Unauthorized distribution of our formats or programs 55 ----- has an adverse effect on our business because it reduces the revenues that we are able to receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our formats or programs. It undermines lawful distribution channels and inhibits our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred in creating such works. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could also result in erosion of our local brands. We incur significant costs in order to protect intellectual property rights to our formats, to monitor copyright infringement and to engage legal proceedings when necessary, which may affect our profitability, and we may not be successful in preventing harm to our business. In addition, it is an inherent risk in our industry that people may claim to have developed a format similar to, and/or own intellectual property rights with respect to our formats and programs, whether or not such claims are frivolous. We may have to resort to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings in order to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation or arbitration proceedings could result in substantial costs, including costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenues from the intellectual property that is the subject of such proceeding, and the resulting diversion of resources and management’s attention could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

We generate revenues not only from producing and licensing these programs, but also from further development of the program (such as producing future seasons) and from secondary revenues such as the distribution in other countries or the licensing of related intellectual property rights. Therefore, revenues from a program, other than the initial license to a broadcaster or digital platform, depend on a program’s audience and its good ratings which are synonymous with the success of a program. A significant portion of Endemol Shine’s revenue, for example, is dependent on the continued success and relevance of MasterChef and Big Brother. Any change in viewer behavior impacting the continued viability of these formats globally may materially impact Endemol Shine’s revenue and profitability. However, once we have produced a program for a broadcaster, its success can be impacted by certain factors that we do not control. For example, broadcasters choose the time slot for the program. If a program is scheduled at a time that cannot adequately reach its targeted audience, the program may not be successful despite its potential. Our customers can also control the promotion and marketing around the program, if any. If a program does not reach a sufficient audience or does not receive satisfactory ratings, we may lose opportunities to generate secondary revenues and, for scripted programs that we have partially financed, we may also be unable to recover distribution advances made by our key distribution subsidiaries, Banijay Rights Limited and Endemol Shine International Limited, While we try to reduce our exposure to any particular program’s success, our business may be negatively impacted if any of our key programs are no longer successful. In addition, we have no control over whether broadcasters decide to renew our programs for additional seasons. When we produce daily or weekly programs, our agreements with broadcasters usually run for the whole television season, typically from September to June, and are generally renewed on that basis. If one of our customers were to decide to stop broadcasting a program that generates significant revenues for us, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, certain scripted programs require high production costs and upfront investments. Banijay’s distribution subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited, and Endemol Shine’s distribution subsidiary, Endemol Shine International Limited, will sometimes participate in these upfront investments, anticipating revenues from the distribution of the scripted program in various countries. If broadcasters decide not to renew the program after the first season, we may incur losses with respect to our upfront investments. Broadcasters may also decide to modify their offering to target a different audience and therefore cancel certain programs. For example, the U.S. television channel Oxygen decided to target a different audience and to focus its offering on family-oriented programs, which led Oxygen to cancel Banijay’s reality program Bad Girls Club after the last season aired in 2017, despite its good ratings. In addition, Channel 5 in the United Kingdom decided not to re-commission Endemol Shine’s reality program Big _Brother in 2018. Decisions from broadcasters to terminate or not to renew some of our programs are_ discretionary and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

In addition, we typically recognize revenues from the sale of a program to a broadcaster at the time of the program’s delivery, which creates a mismatch between the revenues we actually receive in connection with such sale and the revenues recognized in our financial statements. The following factors could impact our generation of revenues from time to time: - Broadcasters may decide to make changes to a program during the production process, which may increase our production costs and cause delays in delivery or even postpone delivery to the next calendar year. Such delays may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. - All broadcasters have a period of time during which they may reject or return our programs for modifications (both for editorial and technical reasons), and until the expiration of such period and the final approval of our content, we may not be able to recognize the expected revenues. - Our revenues depend significantly upon the appeal of our content to our customers, the timing of the release of our programs and the commercial success of these programs, none of which can be predicted with certainty. For example, if a broadcaster decides not to renew one of our programs, it could materially impact our revenues compared to the previous period. - Unanticipated delays in a program’s production can delay our distribution revenues since we are unable to distribute a program until it has been finalized. Accordingly, our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period. The results of one period may not be representative of the results of any future period. Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. This could cause the value of our local brands to fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to meet broadcasters’ growing demands, reduced budgets and timelines, and this may increase our programs’ production costs and future prospects with the same or new broadcasters. If we are not able to honor our obligations with broadcasters, this may negatively impact our production companies’ reputations in their respective markets or affect our formats and programs. In addition, our relationship with certain broadcasters may be jeopardized and lead to a reduction in, or termination of, our business with them if we are unable to honor our obligations in a timely manner or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

We have responded and continue to respond to such trends and developments by modifying, refreshing, extending and expanding our programming and product offerings on an ongoing basis. However, the ultimate appeal and popularity of content and products targeted to viewers can be volatile and we may not be able to anticipate and react quickly enough to shifts in tastes and interests within our local markets. If we inaccurately anticipate trends in popular culture and media, our current content may become less attractive to audiences and the ratings of our current programs may decrease, which could lead to reduced demand for our programs and formats from our customers. We may also lose existing broadcasting slots and new opportunities. Even if we accurately anticipate new trends in the television and digital content sector, we may incur significant costs in adjusting to these new trends. For example, scripted programs are increasingly popular, especially with the development of digital platforms, but are also significantly more expensive to produce than non-scripted programs, our core business. Adapting our business model to such new expensive trends may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. A change in viewer and consumer preferences could cause our programming and our local brands to decline in popularity, particularly if our targeted audience loses interest in our highest rated or viewed programs or our daily programs, and thus, on the most profitable content in our portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Banijay’s top ten formats generated 8.9% of pro forma production revenues and no single format of Banijay accounted for more than 1.4% of pro forma production revenues and Endemol Shine’s top ten formats generated 57 ----- 23.3% of pro forma production revenues and no single format of Endemol Shine accounted for more than 8.1% of pro forma production revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Combined Group’s top ten formats generated 24.7% of pro forma production revenues and no single format of the Combined Group accounted for more than 8.1% of pro forma production revenues. Such changes in viewer preferences and habits could decrease our revenues and jeopardize the renewal of our contracts with broadcasters, distributors and other customers. Moreover, we may invest substantial amounts of resources in a program that is not renewed after the first season and as a result, we will not be able to reach the level of revenues and/or margins budgeted and benefit from our production expertise to increase margins for the following seasons, such as Pine Gap, Banijay’s first original commission from Netflix in Australia, and Troy: Fall of a City, an Endemol Shine co-production between BBC One in the United Kingdom and Netflix. If our programs do not achieve sufficient consumer and audience acceptance or satisfactory ratings, they are not likely to be renewed, which could lead to a decline in our revenues from television and digital content production, distribution and ancillary rights or these revenues may fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Viewers may also object to the content we produce or distribute based on their religious, political or ideological positions. This may apply, in particular, to content that is graphic in nature, politically oriented or targeted at a specific segment of the audience, including, for example, those who speak a certain language. Viewers, interest groups, political and religious parties or other organizations may assert legal claims against us, seek to ban the exhibition of our media content, protest against our programs and products or object in a variety of other ways. Any of the foregoing may require us to expend substantial resources and/or to discontinue certain offerings, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, Cyril Hanouna, one of Banijay’s key managers and a very popular television host in France, was accused of inappropriate behavior on television in Banijay’s program _Touche pas à mon poste! and, on June 7, 2017, the French content regulator (Conseil supérieur de l’audiovisuel_ or the “CSA”) banned C8, the broadcaster of Touche pas à mon poste!, from diffusing any advertisements during the program as well as 15 minutes before and after each broadcast for a period of three weeks. In addition, in April 2019, the CSA issued a warning to C8 pursuant to which Touche pas à mon poste! could be prohibited to air in prime time or access prime time, which may negatively impact our revenues as it might become difficult to negotiate with this broadcaster in the future. The CSA could impose similar or other sanctions in the future. Such decision could have a negative impact on our local brand image and on our revenues.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

If we are not able to obtain sufficient capital, we may be forced to limit the scope of our operations.","The production, completion and distribution of television and digital programs, particularly scripted programs, are subject to a number of uncertainties, including delays and increased expenditures due to disruptions or events beyond our control. Risks such as the death or disability of star performers, technical complications with special effects or other aspects of production, shortages of necessary equipment, damage to film negatives, master tapes and recordings, misbehavior of performers (including actors and/or actresses), employees, participants or other persons acting in connection with our programs or adverse weather conditions may cause cost overruns and delay or frustrate the completion or funding of a production or our return on investments. While we endeavor to respect our broadcaster customers’ budgets and have a strong reputation for achieving this goal, if a television production incurs budget overruns, we may have to use our own cash reserves or seek additional financing from outside sources to complete production. With respect to distribution, if we are unable to accurately predict consumer preferences toward our programs or third-party programs, for which we have the distribution rights, we may lose our investments, especially for scripted programs for which we typically make upfront investments and rely on distribution revenues to finance the production either partially or significantly. While we believe that we will be able to fund our business through operating cash flow generated though our business model, if the generation of our cash flow is lower than anticipated or they do not come to fruition in the anticipated time frame, we could require additional debt financing to sustain our operations. If we are unable to obtain adequate additional debt financing on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to continue to develop our business, especially the production of scripted programs which requires larger investments, especially in the development phase, and we would have to modify our business plan and projections accordingly. If adequate financing is not available, or unavailable on acceptable terms, we may find that we are unable to fund expansion, continue to offer products and services, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance our products or services, or respond to competitive pressures in the industry, all of which may jeopardize our ability to continue operations successfully and profitably. 58 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

A decline in economic activity in the United States or Europe, as well as in other regions of the world, can adversely affect demand for entertainment and could reduce demand for and sales of our formats and programs, thus reducing our revenues and earnings. During the most recent decline in economic conditions in 2008 resulting from the financial crisis, particularly in Spain and in Italy (where advertising revenues have decreased), television networks and broadcasters had less liquidity to acquire rights to new formats and programs from production companies. Similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. Additionally, an increase in price levels generally, or specifically an increase in price levels in television licenses or digital media subscription services, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the television and digital content products we offer, which could also decrease our revenues, increase our costs or both. A decline in economic conditions could also reduce the amount consumers are willing to spend on premium television show offerings and digital content. A decline in demand in any of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Changes in global or regional economic and political conditions may also have a negative impact on the public financing of state-owned broadcasters, such as France Télévisions in France and the BBC in the United Kingdom, which could reduce demand for our programs and cause such broadcasters to decide to not renew certain programs, result in postponements or the cancellation of projects and production orders, or lead to unfavorable renegotiations of production budgets, all of which could result in a reduction in our revenues. Depressed economic conditions can also impair the ability of our business partners to satisfy their financial obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be capable of executing or furthering, to any meaningful degree, our business plans during economic downturns and we may not be able to recoup investments we have made in developing a program. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the political environment in the countries in which we operate may have an impact on the formats and programs we can produce and distribute in certain countries. For example, in certain countries, some of the political talk shows we produce could be suspended or cancelled if the hosts are too critical of the government, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in these countries.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

We must successfully adapt to technological advances in our industry, including the emergence of alternative distribution channels. Consumers are now watching more channels and more content on more devices, driving increased competition for quality programs to deliver audience ratings. Devices such as tablets have accelerated the launch of digital platforms and the rise of social media has increased audience engagement and contributed to new program development. Endemol Shine continues to expand its online presence through strategic partnerships with VOD platforms and other digital distribution channels in order to maximize monetization of Endemol Shine’s content library. In addition to Endemol Shine’s existing partners (such as Amazon Prime Video for electronic sell-through or “EST”), Endemol Shine has scheduled almost ten launches in the first half of 2020 with distribution channels across the world on EST (iTunes, Google), TVOD (Vobile) and AVOD (TiVo, Vudu, Roku) models. Emerging forms of content distribution, such as SVOD services, may provide different economic models and compete with our traditional customers’ channels in ways that are not entirely predictable. Such changes may decrease viewership of our traditional customers’ channels and impact the revenues we are able to generate from them. These new content providers have lower budgets to invest in programs, which requires us to adapt our production methods to these requirements in order to maintain our margins. For example, TF1, France Télévisions and Groupe M6, the three largest broadcasters in France, intend to launch Salto, a new SVOD service. This new service has received clearance from antitrust authorities in France and could negatively impact our business if the three main audiovisual groups in France have a common interest to worsen the conditions offered to independent television content producers such as us or if they acquire programs for both their own broadcasting services and this common new SVOD service with no specific or additional fee for producers. Further, in the United Kingdom, BBC and ITV have launched BritBox, a streaming 59 ----- platform focused on British TV content, which has also struck a content partnership with Channel 4. BritBox was launched in the UK in November 2019, after previous launches in the U.S. and Canada. The emergence of BritBox in the United Kingdom commissioning market presents a potential risk to domestic content producers. After the extension of the BBC iPlayer catch-up window (which refers to the amount of time content is available on the BBC streaming service after the original broadcast date on the BBC) from 30 days to twelve months, which is already restrictive for content producers, the BBC’s latest policy is for BBC-commissioned shows to only move to a SVOD player that meets certain criteria in the subsequent six-month window. There are four criteria, which include a requirement for the SVOD player to provide the BBC with data-based insight into the performance of BBC content on its service. Such criteria could result in content producers for BBC-commissioned shows being unable to negotiate commercial terms with non-BritBox SVOD players and as such, SVOD players may not be willing to meet these criteria. We must also adapt to changes in consumer behavior driven by developments such as digital video recorders and mobile devices that are establishing themselves as alternative providers of video and digital content services. Developing new, innovative and improved formats and programs for evolving content providers is costly and requires capital funding and significant creative resources. There can be no assurance that: (i) the launch of any such new formats and programs would be successful; (ii) our market share for such new formats and programs would continue to grow or remain as it is; (iii) we would be successful in developing other new formats and programs systems or distribution channels or bring them to market in a timely manner, or at all; (iv) our customers would not substitute our formats and programs with competing ones; (v) our formats and programs will be able to address maturing audience trends; or (vi) our competitors would not be able to produce formats and programs similar to ours at a lower cost from other sources.

Further, an increase in spending in the sector has resulted in inflation any costs relating to talent acquisition and retention. We may be unable to offset the increase in labor costs through our revenues. We incur costs for our creative talents, including format creators, hosts, writers, show-runners and producers, who create our original programming. Some of our original programming and our creative talents have achieved significant popularity and critical acclaim, which has increased and could continue to increase the costs of such programming in the future.

Our key markets are mature and competition is significant, resulting in continued price pressure. Our primary competition comes from competitors such as the BBC, ITV Studios Global Entertainment and Fremantle, the in-house production units of large broadcasters and a large number of local production companies. Broadcasters may choose to produce their own content in-house rather than licensing our programs or commissioning a producer. Potential competitors may also have developed innovative formats or blockbusters and have greater name recognition, industry contacts and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged to accelerate their competitive activity. 60 ----- Moreover, potential competitors may establish future cooperative relationships among themselves and with third parties, or merge into or acquire one another, to enhance their programs in the television and digital marketspace.

Given that discussions or activities relating to potential acquisitions range from private negotiations to participation in open bid processes, the timing of any such acquisition is uncertain. Although we actively and regularly engage in discussions and activities with respect to possible acquisitions and investments, we have no present agreements or understandings to enter into any such material transaction, other than related to the Endemol Shine Acquisition.

In addition, we may not realize the expected benefits at the time we enter into agreements for these type of transactions. We acquire production companies to, among other things, expand into new markets or genres in a particular market, access talents and acquire intellectual property rights of formats and programs developed by such companies and to benefit from the expertise of creative talents or producers at such companies. If broadcasters are no longer interested in the programs or formats resulting from these acquisitions, or if broadcasters are no longer interested in working with such creative talents or producers, and decide not to renew them shortly after the relevant acquisition, we may not be able to realize the expected revenues and we may fail to recoup our investments.

For example, if broadcasters were to decide not to acquire adventure programs with Bear Grylls in certain countries, this could have a material impact on the expected revenues and synergies derived from the Bear Grylls Acquisition, and consequently, on our cash flow generation. Additionally, if the Mexican and U.S. Spanish-language entertainment markets do not grow in line with our projections, Endemol Shine’s joint venture with Boomdog may not be as profitable as it expected. Future acquisitions by us could also result in the following consequences: - we may fail to identify suitable acquisition or joint venture opportunities, which may restrict our ability to grow our business; - we may face competition from our direct competitors for certain acquisitions or joint venture opportunities that we may consider beneficial, which could make it more difficult to organically increase our business; - we may fail to retain creative talents following an acquisition or business combination; - we may not plan or manage a particular acquisition effectively; - we may be unable to procure financing for an acquisition on satisfactory terms or at all; 62 ----- - we may face increased competition for acquisitions as markets in which we operate undergo continuing consolidation; - we may not be able to retain key personnel or customer contracts of acquired businesses or joint ventures (which, in the case of such contracts, can be due to change of control clauses in such contracts); - we may encounter unanticipated events, circumstances or legal liabilities related to the acquired businesses for which we may be responsible as the successor owner, controlling entity or operator in spite of any investigation we make prior to the acquisition and for which we have no or insufficient protection; - labor laws in certain countries may require us to retain more employees than would otherwise be optimal from entities we acquire; - future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense or contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and/or cash flow; - future acquisitions may be subject to antitrust or competition approval of the transaction, which may cause significant delays to the completion of any such acquisition or may prevent it from being consummated at all; - an acquisition may not achieve anticipated synergies or other expected benefits, or we may underestimate the costs related to the implementation of such synergies or cost savings; - we may incur substantial costs, face delays or experience other operational or financial problems in integrating acquired businesses, such as costs and issues relating to monitoring, hiring and training new personnel, the implementation of governance and compliance systems and procedures, the integration of information technology and accounting and internal control systems; - we may incur costs associated with developing appropriate risk management and internal control structures for acquisitions in a new market, or understanding and complying with a new regulatory scheme; - increased investments may be needed in order to understand new markets and follow trends in these markets in order to compete effectively; - we may have a reduced ability to predict our performance or expenditures in the event we have less experience in the market of the acquired business than in the markets in which we previously operated; - we may face potential economic or political instability depending on the countries in which we acquire a business or a company; - acquisitions may divert our management’s attention from the operation of existing businesses; - the incurrence or assumption of debt and contingent liabilities, which debt may or may not increase our leverage relative to our EBITDA or equity capitalization; - the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles; - the development write-offs; and - other acquisition related expenses.

458_2,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.18,Litigation and production issues may harm our business or otherwise distract management.,"Substantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and could distract our management. For example, lawsuits by broadcasters, licensors or other customers, consumers, employees, competitors, partners/shareholders or the social or tax administrations could be very costly and disrupt business. In addition, we may incur significant litigation costs with respect to international disputes, particularly if disputes occur in jurisdictions in which we do not operate or if disputes result in arbitration. While disputes from time to time are not uncommon, we may not be able to resolve such disputes on terms favorable to us. As a result, members of management may be distracted from their business roles and we may face substantial expenses and monetary damages, damage to our reputation and brands, and decreased demand for our content, all of which 63 ----- could also have a material adverse effect on our business. For a description of certain key ongoing material litigation, see “Banijay’s Business—Legal Proceedings” and “Endemol Shine’s Business—Legal Proceedings.” The ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid. Legal proceedings in connection with accidents, incidents or misbehavior during the production process of our programs and formats may also disrupt our business. Certain of our programs are adventure-based shows, reality shows and physical game shows and may be produced outdoors and in remote locations. While we take our duty of care owed to participants seriously and always aim to implement all the necessary security measures, we may not be able to prevent accidents, casualties, unexpected incidents or misbehavior that may be costly and may significantly impact our business in terms of image and reputation. For example, in March 2015, two helicopters carrying show participants and employees of Banijay for the production of the format Dropped collided in Argentina, causing the death of all the passengers. Criminal investigations and civil proceedings have been initiated in Argentina and in France. In addition, during the shooting of Koh Lanta (the French equivalent of _Survivor, produced by Banijay’s subsidiary Adventure Line Productions) in May 2018 an incident between two_ participants occurred and lead to the cancellation of the show. See “Banijay’s Business—Legal Proceedings.” In addition, as a producer and distributor of original and third-party media content, we face potential liability based on a variety of causes of action, including defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature, content, creation or distribution of such content. These types of claims have been brought against us and other producers and/or distributors of media content. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover any such liability that results from any of the foregoing claims. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, investigating and defending these types of claims are expensive and could subject us to significant monetary costs or cause a change in business practices or reputation that could negatively impact our ability to compete and grow our business.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

As a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include: - issues related to integrating and managing international operations, subsidiaries and investments; - potentially adverse tax developments. For example, we benefit from tax incentives in certain jurisdictions and from time to time, we conduct internal reorganizations in order to leverage the tax incentives available to us. A change in tax regulations may have a negative impact in our business in these jurisdictions; - a lack of sufficient protection for intellectual property in some countries; - territorial restrictions on content licensing; - currency exchange restrictions, export controls and currency devaluation risks in some foreign countries; - compliance with different data protection and anti-corruption regulations; - the existence in some countries of regulatory or other restrictions that impede the ability of foreign companies to conduct business in such countries; - the existence of quotas and other content-related limitations or restrictions (such as government censorship); - restrictions on television advertising and marketing; - issues related to occupational safety and adherence to local labor laws and regulations; - political or social unrest; - higher than anticipated costs of entry; - the presence of corruption in certain countries; - the absence of good diplomatic relations between the countries in which we operate and certain other countries; 64 ----- - the potential for government appropriation of our assets; and - restrictions on expatriating cash or other assets in some countries (for example, India). Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The outcome of that referendum was in favor of leaving the European Union (“Brexit”). Under Article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty (“Article 50”), the United Kingdom was originally expected to cease to be a Member State when a withdrawal agreement is entered into, or failing that, two years following the notification of an intention to leave under Article 50, unless the European Council (together with the United Kingdom) unanimously decides to extend this period. On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the European Union. However, as a result of the failure to reach a mutually satisfactory withdrawal agreement on March 22, 2019, the European Council granted the extension of the notice period under Article 50 to April 12, 2019, which was further extended to October 31, 2019 and again extended until January 31, 2020. Moreover, as a result of the failure to reach a consensus internally within the United Kingdom’s Parliament, the United Kingdom held a general election in December 12, 2019 in order to form a new majority in Parliament to resolve Brexit. Discussions between the United Kingdom and the European Union regarding a withdrawal agreement are ongoing. Ongoing uncertainty on whether the government and parliament of the United Kingdom and the European Union will agree to a revised withdrawal agreement sustains the possibility that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and transition plan in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption. The effects of Brexit will also depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Regardless of the form of any withdrawal or transition agreement, there are likely to be changes in the legal rights and obligations of commercial parties across all industries following Brexit. Until the United Kingdom officially exits the European Union, European Union laws and regulations will continue to apply in the United Kingdom, and changes to the application of these laws and regulations are unlikely to occur during negotiations. However, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom’s legal, political and economic relationship with the other countries in which we operate, there may continue to be instability in the global market, significant currency fluctuations, or otherwise adverse effects on trading agreements or similar cross-border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future, including beyond the date of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. We have several production companies based in the United Kingdom, including Endemol Shine UK Ltd. which operates a variety of scripted and non-scripted labels in the United Kingdom. These labels include, for example, Tiger Aspect Productions, which produces Peaky Blinders, a co-production with Caryn Mandabach Productions, airing on BBC One in the United Kingdom and globally on Netflix. Peaky Blinders is one of Endemol Shine’s key productions and has been sold across over 180 territories. Banijay also operates its distribution business through its subsidiary Banijay Rights Limited, an entity incorporated in the United Kingdom, and Endemol Shine operates certain of its distribution businesses through its English subsidiary, Endemol Shine International Limited, which manages the distribution of programs. As a result of Brexit, we may be unable to operate our business in a manner consistent with our past practice and the costs of doing business in the United Kingdom may increase. Brexit could also negatively impact secondary revenues and advertising revenues in the United Kingdom. In addition, the lack of clarity on applicable laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace, replicate or eliminate, including financial and tax laws and regulations and free trade agreements, may increase costs associated with operating in the United Kingdom. Additionally, it may become increasingly difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Bank of England will maintain its current interest and quantitative easing policies and asset valuations and credit ratings may be subject to increased market volatility. Further, Brexit could result in continued or sustained adverse effects on the exchange rate of the pound sterling against other foreign currencies which we utilize in our operations. It is also possible that Brexit will lead other member states of the European Union to consider leaving the European Union or discontinuing the use of the 65 ----- euro, which could be an additional source of instability in the markets. There can be no assurance that Brexit would not have a negative impact on Banijay Rights Limited, Endemol Shine UK Ltd. or any of our subsidiaries incorporated in the United Kingdom, or on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

In certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, the status of participants in reality television programs has been challenged and they have been recognized as employees, which has required us to enter into specific agreements with them and pay additional associated costs. Our industry relies heavily on freelancers and, in certain jurisdictions, contracts with freelancers can allow them to claim the status of permanent employees and to benefit from the rules attached to such status, which has a cost for us. There can be no assurance that new employment regulations will not significantly impact our business and result in a material increase in costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In certain instances, we consult and seek the input of our employee works councils with respect to a broad range of matters, and certain of our subsidiaries are required to consult works councils to grant Guarantees under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture. While we generally have been able to successfully consult with our works councils and we regard our relations with our executives, employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may be challenging in connection with the integration process of the Combined Group, as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our executives and employees.

The Senior Notes Issuer holds 100.0% of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Two companies, LDH and Vivendi, can make all corporate decisions for Banijay and will be able to make all corporate decisions for the Combined Group. LDH alone, or, as the case may be, together with Vivendi, can decide the election of directors, the amendment of our bylaws and any approval of mergers, and other significant corporate transactions. See “Shareholders—Shareholders’ Agreements.” Moreover, LOV Banijay (controlled by Stéphane Courbit), alone as the majority owner of LDH, or, as the case may be, with DeA and Fimalac, can direct LDH’s votes. Our controlling shareholders’ actions can affect our strategic decisions, our legal and capital structure, and our day-to-day operations. In addition, they may have a direct or indirect interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions that, in their judgment could enhance their equity interests, even though these transactions may involve risks. In addition, sales of significant amounts of the Combined Group companies’ shares held by either LOV Banijay, DeA, Fimalac, LDH, Vivendi or Banijay Group Holding, or the prospect of these sales, could taint our brand and our value and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

458_2,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.25,Some of our productions qualify for audiovisual production subsidies and tax incentives or benefits from financing sourced from investors that benefit from tax incentives.,"As an audiovisual production company, we benefit from different sets of subsidies and tax incentives in France, other European countries (such as the United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain and Italy) and non-European countries (such as Canada, the Republic of Fiji, Australia and the U.S.) which support our productions (mainly fiction and animation movies). For example, in France, we benefit from government subsidies and other financial incentives to support the production of documentaries, fiction, live entertainment, magazines of cultural interest and animation movies. The French audiovisual fund (Compte de Soutien à l’Industrie des Programmes _audiovisuels) automatically allocates funding to the production, development and writing of pilots under several_ conditions linked to the producer acting as the executive producer, the length and cost of the production, language shooting requirements (whether authors, actors and crews are EU nationals and/or residents in a Member State) or shooting location. They are capped at a certain percentage of the production budget and we must obtain prior approval from the National Center of Cinema (Centre National du Cinéma). We also rely on tax laws and regulations to benefit from tax credits and we monetize those tax credits in some of the countries in which we operate. Changes in tax laws and regulations in these countries may prevent us from benefitting from these tax credits, partly or at all, and we may not be able to continue to monetize tax credits in these jurisdictions. Those changes could have a material impact on our results of operations. We also raise financing from companies dedicated to the financing of cinema and the audiovisual industry (Sociétés de Financement de l’Industrie Cinématographique et de l’Audiovisuel), or other similar foreign companies, which are investment firms that collect private funds dedicated to finance cinematographic and audiovisual productions by offering a personal income tax incentive to private individual investors. Our production expenditures benefit from a favorable amortization regime allowing to deduct from our taxable basis, under specific conditions, the net income generated by a specific production in a given financial year. If, at the end of a given financial year, such income is not sufficient to fully consummate the amortization right that relates to such production, income arising out of other productions can be used to be offset against the outstanding amount of amortization allowances. The above subsidies and incentives have a positive impact on our production costs and capacity to raise financing. Any changes in the conditions underlying the benefit of these subsidies and incentives may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.26,Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.,"We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in tax laws or regulations or in their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, such as our effective tax rate or tax payments. For example, in the United States, where we generated 19.2% of our pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted at the end of 2017 in the United States imposed a minimum tax, referred to as Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, to prevent companies with domestic revenue greater than $500 million from reducing taxable income in the U.S. through payments to related foreign parties that would have been otherwise deductible such as, for example, interest and royalty payments. In addition, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. For example, the current incorporation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax 67 ----- Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017, may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing structures. Moreover, the HMRC has contested Endemol Shine’s Growth Securities Ownership Plan operated by Endemol Shine UK Ltd. and Tiger Aspect Productions Ltd as a tax avoidance scheme. Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017 by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries. Amongst the set of proposed measures, the ATAD provides for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses would be limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such new rules apply as from January 2019 further to the transposition into French tax law by Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 20181317 of December 28, 2018) of the general interest limitation rule provided for by the ATAD with effect as from January 1, 2019. The Council of the European Union also adopted on February 21, 2017 a new directive in order to address hybrid mismatches with non-Member States that will come into force on January 1, 2020. The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) (the “French Finance Law for 2020”) introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and repealed the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the French Tax Code. The new anti-hybrid limitation ceases to refer to a minimum taxation rate, but rather emphasizes the hybrid character of the debt instrument. In addition, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities might ignore an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The European Commission has also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016, including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. The directive proposal on the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European Union for its adoption following consultation of the European Parliament (special legislative procedure), which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. It is expected to be implemented in two steps, with the common base being implemented as a first step and consolidation being put in place swiftly afterwards. Furthermore, new rules on tax dispute resolution already apply since January 1, 2019 following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the French Finance Law for 2019. These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future. Another area of uncertainty concerns the progressive decrease of the French statutory corporate income tax rate provided for by Article 219 of the French Tax Code from 33.33% to 25% (or from 34.43% to 25.83% if the 3.3% social contribution provided for by Article 235 ter ZC of the French Tax Code is added to the French statutory corporate income tax rate) over a period of four years starting in 2019. Even though such decrease was enacted by the French Finance Law for 2018, a new French tax bill, released by the French government on March 6, 2019 and enacted by the French Parliament on July 24, 2019, postponed the decrease of the French statutory corporate income tax rate applicable to companies generating a French turnover exceeding €250 million for the portion of their taxable profits exceeding €500,000 to fiscal year 2020 to address budget constraints of the French State. As a consequence, such companies will still be subject to the 33.33% (or 34.43% including the above mentioned additional 3.3% social contribution) rate in 2019 instead of 31% (or 32.02% including the above mentioned additional 3.3% social contribution) as initially expected for the portion of their taxable profits exceeding €500,000. Furthermore, the French Finance Law for 2020 has amended the pace of the contemplated decrease of the French statutory corporate income tax rate applicable to these companies for (i) 2020 from 28% (or 28.92% including the above mentioned additional 3.3% social contribution) to 31% (or 32.02% including the above mentioned additional 3.3% social contribution) for the portion of their taxable profits exceeding €500,000 and (ii) 2021 from 26.5% (or 27.37% including the above mentioned additional 3.3% social contribution) to 27.5% (or 28.41% including the above mentioned additional 3.3% social contribution). 68 ----- We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including to benefit from various tax credits. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, or if we are unable to retain any favorable tax rulings once we begin operating as the Combined Group, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our products or services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

We have also presented certain financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, on a run-rate basis, which consists of financial information available for a period shorter than a full financial year that management annualizes on the basis of assumptions regarding the future performance of a business for the full year derived from the performance of such business for such shorter period and possibly past periods. However, past performance may not be indicative of actual or future results, which may differ significantly from annualized results due to the impact of many factors, risks and uncertainties, many of which may not be within our control. In light of the foregoing, the financial information included in this offering memorandum may not be representative of our actual or future results and performance. Our lack of operating history as the Combined Group and the challenge of integrating our original businesses make evaluating our business and future financial prospects difficult.

For example, we could become liable for overdue payables of Endemol Shine to suppliers and employees that are not currently known to us, or we could become subject to tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of which we underestimated.

We may not be able to realize these measures, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving these measures may be higher than what we expect. Our ability to realize such operational efficiency and cost savings measures may be affected by a number of factors, including increases in expenses related to the Endemol Shine Acquisition as the Endemol Shine Acquisition has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus from management, which could adversely affect their ability to operate the business. These factors may offset, partially or in whole, the cost savings from the Endemol Shine Acquisition. Moreover, successful integration and the realization of synergies require, among other things, proper co-ordination of business development and marketing efforts, retention of key members of management, policies for effective recruitment and training as well as the ability to adapt information and computer systems. Any difficulties encountered in combining operations could result in higher integration costs and lower savings or 73 ----- revenues than expected. There will accordingly be uncertainty as to the extent to which anticipated synergies will be achieved and the timing of their realization. Moreover, the integration of Banijay’s existing operations with the operations of Endemol Shine could interfere with the respective businesses and divert management’s attention from other aspects of the Combined Group’s business, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operation. In addition, the ability of the Combined Group to realize the anticipated synergies is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control, such as labor laws, changes to government regulation governing or otherwise impacting its industry, employee strikes, changes in the political environment in countries where the Combined Group operates, obtaining appropriate approvals and licenses, operating difficulties, customer preferences, changes in competition and general economic or industry conditions.

Endemol Shine’s operations increase our exposure to the risks of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may impact currency translation adjustments. In the absence of hedging, currency fluctuations between the euro and the currencies of the various markets in which Endemol Shine operates may affect our results and make it difficult to compare performance levels in those markets from year to year. If the euro appreciates (or depreciates) against another currency, the euro value of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses initially recognized in that other currency will decline (or increase). To partially offset this exposure, we will continue Endemol Shine’s practice of utilizing cash flows arising in a given currency to pay for expenses arising in the same currency wherever possible, and we may also engage in certain limited hedging transactions.

The integration of the Endemol Shine business into our business is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process, and may face unforeseen challenges. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrate Endemol Shine’s business practices and operations with ours. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the realization of the full expected benefits.

A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, including our failure to comply with the financial covenant under the Revolving Credit Facility, could result in an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a payment event of default that is continuing under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, subject to the applicable cure period, and upon the acceleration of indebtedness with respect to any other event of default by the creditors under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the relevant creditors could, among other things, terminate any available facilities, cancel any undrawn commitments and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Facilities, including our failure to comply with the financial covenant under the Revolving Credit Facility, could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indentures. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy the other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes.

The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the Indentures and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, we may be unable to find alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.

The actual realization of these assets in future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the future results of the relevant entities. In particular, pursuant to Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the French Tax Code (Code général des impôts), the fraction of French tax loss carry-forwards that may be used to offset the taxable profit with respect to a given fiscal year is limited to €1.0 million plus 50% of the portion of taxable profit exceeding €1.0 million. Similar rules apply to tax losses generated by French tax consolidated groups. As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded tax loss carry-forwards notably in France and the United Kingdom. The French tax loss carry-forwards have been reflected in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulting in the amount of €10.0 million of deferred tax assets corresponding to the portion of tax loss carry-forwards that we expect to offset against operating profits in the following fiscal years. Any reduction in our ability to use these assets due to changes in laws and regulations, potential tax reassessment or lower than expected results could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The services we provide to certain of our customers are subject to value-added taxes, sales taxes or other similar taxes. Specific reduced VAT rates are also applicable to our services when they relate to the sale of economic rights recognized in law to authors and performers as well as the sale of broadcasting rights to 78 ----- audiovisual works. Tax rates may increase at any time and, subject to the ability of our customers to recover such taxes, any such increase could affect our business and the demand for our services, and thereby reduce our operating profit, negatively affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow available to service our indebtedness. Moreover, French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness. The French Finance Law for 2019 includes specific provisions which introduce into French tax legislation the provisions of the ATAD regarding interest deductibility limitations in respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2019. The tax rules on deductibility, as well as generally applicable tax principles, and specific tax rules and principles applicable in other jurisdictions in which the Group operates, may limit the Group’s ability to deduct interest accrued on the Group’s indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase the Group’s tax burden, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The EU List was established following a screening and a dialogue conducted by a code of conduct working group appointed by the Council during 2017 with a large number of third country jurisdictions. The Black List, which shall be updated at least once a year, is currently (according to the list as of November 7, 2019) composed of eight jurisdictions (American Samoa, Fiji, Guam, Oman, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States Virgin Islands and Vanuatu). Furthermore, the Council published a Grey List of screened jurisdictions that committed to introduce changes in their tax legislation in order to comply with the European Union screening criteria. Though there is no applicable sanction yet, Member States are encouraged by the Council Conclusions to agree on coordinated sanctions to apply at national level against these listed jurisdictions, such as increased monitoring and audits, withholding taxes, special documentation requirements and anti-abuse provisions. A new French law that aims at fighting fraud was published on October 24, 2018 (Law 2018-898 of October 23, 2018) and expands under certain conditions the French tax regime regarding the Non-Cooperative States and jurisdictions as defined under Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code to certain States and jurisdictions included into the Black List. As a result, interest paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in certain States and jurisdictions included into the Black List or paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in such States and jurisdictions may be subject to withholding tax in France and not be deductible for purposes of the computation of the debtor’s corporate income tax liability. The new provisions applies to States and jurisdictions after their inclusion by 79 ----- order (arrêté) on the list of Non-Cooperative States and jurisdictions as defined under Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code. In December 2019, the Dutch Tax Plan 2020 (Pakket Belastingplan 2020) was adopted by the Dutch parliament (Staten-Generaal). This Dutch Tax Plan 2020 includes several measures, one of which may in particular become relevant within the context of the payments in respect of the Notes, being the introduction of a conditional withholding tax on certain payments of interest and royalties as of 1 January 2021. The conditional withholding tax is an anti-abuse measure and will apply to interest and royalty payments by a Dutch entity (broadly defined) to a related entity or permanent establishment of such entity (i) in a specifically listed low-tax jurisdiction that has no profits tax or a tax rate that is lower than 9%, or which is included in the EU Blacklist for non-cooperative jurisdictions or (ii) in certain abusive situations (for example, artificial arrangements whereby interest and royalty payments are diverted through a high-tax jurisdiction to ultimately end up in a low-tax or EU blacklisted jurisdiction). The conditional withholding tax will be levied at a rate of 21.7%, equal to the headline Dutch corporate income tax rate in 2021. Payer and Payee entities are related to one another if (i) the payer has a “qualifying interest” in the payee or vice versa or (ii) a third entity has a qualifying interest in both the payer and the payee. Entities can also be related if they are considered a cooperating group that jointly, directly or indirectly, have a qualifying interest in an entity. A qualifying interest is an interest through which directly or indirectly sufficient influence can be exercised, such that the activities of the relevant entity can be determined. In any event, an interest is qualifying if it represents more than 50% of the statutory voting rights in an entity.

The Senior Facilities will bear interest at a variable rate based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) in respect of utilizations in euros or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for all other utilizations (in each case, subject to a 0% per annum floor), as applicable, and in each case plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement does not contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we expect to enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be or will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including credit risks in relation to such hedging counterparties and the risk that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. Further, there may be a mismatch between the successor rates applied in respect of our floating rate debt and the successor rates applied in respect of hedging arrangements thereon, which may render such hedging arrangements ineffective in managing our interest rate risks. To the extent interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement and a subsequent speech by the Director of Markets and Wholesale Policy at the FCA on January 28, 2019 indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed, and market participants should not rely on its publication, after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. 81 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent _des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code (as modified by Ordinance n 2017-748 of_ 86 ----- 4 May 2017, which came into force on October 1, 2017).

The market, if any, for the Notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. Although application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, no assurance can be given that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange or that such listing will be maintained.

Our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee the Notes or grant security interests in the Collateral in this respect. Generally, holders of debt of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuers or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound-up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuers (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and - the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuers or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, would be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Notes and each related Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Issue Date Guarantors accounted for 83.8% of Banijay’s total assets, 38.4% of Banijay’s consolidated revenues and 67.6% of Banijay’s EBITDA. Giving effect to the Endemol Shine Acquisition, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Guarantors would have accounted for 82.9% of the consolidated _pro forma total assets, 52.6% of the consolidated pro forma revenues and 80.5% of the consolidated pro forma_ EBITDA of the Combined Group. As of September 30, 2019, after giving effect to the Transactions, subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer (excluding Endemol Shine) not guaranteeing the Notes had total debt of €17.8 million (excluding debt incurred under the Existing Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (which will be repaid as part of the Refinancing) and intercompany loans) and subsidiaries of the Target not guaranteeing the Notes had total debt of €77.7 million (excluding intercompany loans). This amount will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the related Guarantees. The Indentures, subject to certain limitations, will permit these non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, which may also be secured. A portion of our non-guarantor subsidiaries’ indebtedness is secured on property or assets that do not form part of the Collateral securing the Notes, and the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing Arrangements.” Any of the debt that our non-guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the Indentures will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the related Guarantees, and any debt we incur that is secured on property or assets that do not form part of the Collateral securing the Notes will be effectively senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The directors, officers and other executives of the Issuers and certain of the Guarantors are neither residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore, most of the assets of the Issuers and certain of the Guarantors and their respective directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not 91 ----- be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France, the United States, England and Wales or the Netherlands upon those persons or entities, provided that the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965, is complied with (where applicable) or service is otherwise effected in accordance with the laws and requirements of the jurisdiction of the relevant proceedings and of the jurisdiction in which service is to be effected. For example, the United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that certain conditions have been met.

In such a situation, the Issuers may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuers will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuers may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness.

Description of the Transactions,"We refer to the Offering, the Endemol Shine Acquisition, the repayment of certain existing debt of Endemol Shine, the Acquisition Financing and the Refinancing collectively as the “Transactions.” _The Refinancing_ On the Issue Date, Banijay will use the proceeds of the issuance of the Euro Senior Secured Notes to (A) redeem all of its outstanding Existing Notes, (B) repay all amounts outstanding under its Existing Senior Credit Facilities, (C) refinance the consideration paid for the Bear Grylls Acquisition, (D) fund cash to the balance sheet of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, which Banijay intends to use as part of the financing of the Endemol Shine Acquisition and (E) pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing ((A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) collectively, the “Refinancing”). If the Endemol Shine Acquisition is not consummated, the portion of the proceeds of the Euro Senior Secured Notes remaining on the balance sheet of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be used for the general corporate purposes of the Group, including the payment of certain fees and expenses in connection with the Endemol Shine Acquisition. See “Use of Proceeds.” In order to complete the Refinancing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will on-lend on or around the Issue Date a portion of the proceeds of the Euro Senior Secured Notes by way of the Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans to its subsidiaries that entered into intercompany loans with the Senior Notes Issuer in 2017 to receive a portion of the proceeds of the issuance of the Existing Notes and borrowings under the Existing Senior Credit Facilities. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and these subsidiaries will use the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans to repay these intercompany loans and other intercompany debt, such as vendor notes, to the Senior Notes Issuer, which will use these proceeds to repay the Existing Notes and the Existing Senior Credit Facilities. The Bear Grylls Acquisition was closed on October 7, 2019 and was not considered sufficiently significant to be reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information. _The Endemol Shine Acquisition_ On October 25, 2019, Banijay entered into the Endemol Shine Acquisition Agreement to acquire the entire share capital of the Target from the Sellers. Following the completion of the Endemol Shine Acquisition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will hold 100% of the shares of the Target. The consummation of the Endemol Shine Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including clearance by the antitrust authorities. Under the terms of the Endemol Shine Acquisition Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has agreed to take all necessary steps to obtain the required clearances after the signing of the Endemol Shine Acquisition Agreement. If these conditions are not satisfied on or prior to January 25, 2021, and such date has not been extended by the parties, the Endemol Shine Acquisition Agreement may be terminated. The Endemol Shine Acquisition Agreement contains customary warranties and indemnities given by the Sellers and the Target as to capacity, title and disclosure as well as customary covenants given by the Sellers regarding, among other things, the conduct of the business and the affairs of Endemol Shine pending the completion of the Endemol Shine Acquisition. The Sellers’ liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds and limitations. The consummation of the Endemol Shine Acquisition (including the repayment of certain existing indebtedness owed by the Target and certain of its subsidiaries, as well as the payment of estimated transaction fees and expenses) is expected to require an aggregate of €2,018.0 million (equivalent) in a combination of debt financing and equity. The Endemol Shine Acquisition, the repayment of certain existing debt of Endemol Shine, and the related transaction fees and expenses will be financed through (i) (A) the issuance of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of €725.0 million (equivalent) and (B) drawings under the EUR Term Loan B and the USD Term Loan B in the aggregate principal amount of €953.0 million (equivalent) ((A) and (B) collectively, the “Acquisition Financing”), (ii) €275.0 million of cash funding to be provided by Financière LOV S.A.S. and Fimalac, together through LDH, and by Vivendi to Banijay Group Holding, which will contribute such funds to the Senior Notes Issuer, which will in turn contribute such funds to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, by way of an equity contribution (the “Equity Contribution”) and (iii) the portion of the proceeds of the issuance of the Euro Senior Secured Notes remaining on the balance sheet of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will advance the proceeds of the Senior Notes Offering to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by way of the Senior Notes Proceeds Loan. The proceeds of the Acquisition Financing and the Equity Contribution will be used as further described under “—Sources and Uses of the Transactions.” 107 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

(k) Reclassification of €243.0 million from “Other assets related to customers” and €117.4 million from “Other liabilities related to contracts with customers” to €359.2 million in “Work-in-progress,” €158.6 million in “Trade receivables” (related to unbilled revenue) and €392.2 in “Other current liabilities” (related to deferred revenue) to align the presentation of Banijay and Endemol Shine’s financial statements with those of Banijay. 110 ----- _2.1.2 Income Statement_ The following table presents the reclassification adjustments on the income statement of Endemol Shine for the year ended December 31, 2018:",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Transaction and Accounting Adjustments,"The Endemol Shine Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires to determine and record the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as of the closing date of the acquisition. As of the date of the offering memorandum, we have not performed this valuation and the related allocation of the purchase price. Accordingly, no pro forma adjustment has been made to reflect the estimated fair value of identified intangible assets acquired and the purchase price allocation may result in significant adjustments to the historical values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, resulting in significant increases in depreciation and amortization expense. 113 ----- _3.1 Accounting policies alignments and Intercompany Eliminations 3.1.1 GAAP adjustments and accounting policies alignments:_ We have made the following adjustments to Endemol Shine’s historical income statement and statement of financial position to align the accounting policies of Endemol Shine with accounting policies of Banijay: (a) We have reclassified certain transactions for which Banijay and Endemol Shine have a different assessment of the agent versus principal relationship under IFRS 15 (Revenue from contracts with _customers). The impact of this reclassification between revenue and operating expenses for the year_ ended December 31, 2018, the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 amounted to €3.1 million, €3.3 million and €1.5 million, respectively. (b) We have aligned the discount rates used by Endemol Shine to determine liabilities in connection with put options held by non-controlling interests following an acquisition with the discount rate used by Banijay in the same periods. In the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statements, this adjustment amounted to €5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, €4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and €3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. In the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019, this adjustment resulted in a €0.9 million increase in other long-term liabilities, €0.4 million decrease in other current liabilities and €0.5 million decrease in retained earnings and other reserves. 3.1.2 Intercompany Elimination: (c) Intercompany transactions between Banijay Rights, a subsidiary of the Issuers, and Endemol Shine France have been identified in the amount of €0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, €0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and €1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These intercompany transactions reflect royalties and format fees paid by Endemol Shine France to Banijay Rights. We have not identified any intercompany balances as of September 30, 2019 between Banijay Group and Endemol Shine group, consequently, no elimination of such balances was performed in the Unaudited _Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019. 3.2 Preliminary Purchase Accounting Adjustments_ The Acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination in the pro forma consolidated financial information, in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) which requires that identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at their fair values as of the acquisition date. As of the date of the offering memorandum, we have not estimated the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed for purposes of the preliminary purchase accounting of Endemol Shine. The purchase accounting may result in significant adjustments to the historical values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, resulting in significant increase in depreciation and amortization expense. The purchase accounting is preliminary. In accordance with IFRS 3, the measurement period shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date.

The following pro forma adjustments have been made to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information to reflect the preliminary purchase accounting: (a) In the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019, we made an adjustment of €594.9 million in the “Goodwill” to reflect the difference between the preliminary goodwill amounting to €1,738.5 million and the historical goodwill of Endemol Shine amounting to €1,143.7 million. (b) In the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019, we made an adjustment of €(89.2) million on the cash and cash equivalents. This adjustment results from the difference between: (i) cash increase of €275.0 million corresponding to the equity contribution to be provided by Financière LOV S.A.S. and Fimalac, together through LDH, and by Vivendi to Banijay Group Holding, (ii) cash decrease of €313.6 corresponding to the consideration payable for the Endemol Shine Acquisition to the purchase price for the entire share capital of the Target, (iii) cash decrease of €31.3 million against “trade and other payables” corresponding to the payment of certain fees and expenses due to the Sellers under their existing agreements with Endemol Shine. (iv) cash decrease of €19.3 corresponding to the payment of the estimated acquisition costs (excluding debt issuance costs associated with the Refinancing and the Acquisition Financing which Banijay will capitalize and amortize over the duration period of the debt) including both (a) incurred costs as of September 30, 2019 for €4.9 million and (b) costs not yet incurred as of September 3, 2019 for €14.4 million (see note (e) below). (c) In the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019, we made adjustments to eliminate the net assets of Endemol Shine, that represent the equity of Endemol Shine as of September 30, 2019, including €14.9 million of issued capital, €824.3 million of share premiums and €(1,070.2) million of retained earnings and other reserves. (d) The Endemol Shine capitalized debt issuance costs as of September 30, 2019 amounting to €(50.1) million have been reversed from “Long-term borrowings and other financial liabilities” against “Goodwill” with regard to the purchase price accounting, due to the Endemol Shine’s debt acceleration as a consequence of its change of control/acquisition by Banijay. (e) The estimated costs of the Endemol Shine Acquisition (excluding costs associated with the Refinancing and the Acquisition Financing) not yet incurred as of September 30, 2019 by Banijay (€14.4 million) have been deducted from equity against “Cash and cash equivalents” in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet. Costs of the Endemol Shine Acquisition incurred by Banijay for the year ended December 31, 2018, in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 for €4.0 million, €3.3 million and €1.0 million, respectively, have been excluded from the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statements. An amount of €4.9 million was deducted from the cash position in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet of Banijay to give effect to the cash payment of such costs pursuant to September 30, 2019. No information as to transaction costs incurred by Endemol Shine after September 30, 2019 is available. Therefore, the value of the net assets of Endemol Shine has not been reduced, and the amount of preliminary goodwill has not been increased with respect to such acquisition costs if any. (f) Endemol Shine recorded impairments of its own goodwill for €44.1 million, €0.0 million and €0.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Because we exclude the goodwill recorded in the Target’s historical financial statements (€1,143.7 million as of September 30, 2019) from the value of the net assets of Endemol Shine for purposes of the preliminary purchase accounting of Endemol Shine reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, the related impairments recorded in the historical consolidated income statements of Endemol Shine have been reversed. _3.3 Financing Adjustments_ We intend to roll over Endemol Shine’s Borrowing Base Facility (€44.6 million), its finance leases (€136.9 million) and a portion of its bilateral facilities (€27.2 million). 115 ----- The total gross proceeds from the new debt financing amount to €2,203.0 million, consisting of €325.0 million (equivalent) in aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes, €525.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Euro Senior Secured Notes, €400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and €953.0 million aggregate drawings under the EUR Term Loan B and the USD Term Loan B, together. The proceeds of the offering of the Euro Senior Secured Notes will be used on the Issue Date as set forth in “The Transactions—The Refinancing” and the proceeds of the offering of the Dollar Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes, together with drawings under the EUR Term Loan B and the USD Term Loan B, the Equity Contribution and retained cash proceeds from the offering of the Euro Senior Secured Notes, will be used on the Acquisition Completion Date as set forth in “The Transactions—The Endemol Shine Acquisition.” Consequently, pro forma adjustments relating to these financings have been made, as detailed below, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019: - €2,147.3 million in connection to the issuing of the new debt amounting to €2,203.0 million and the amortization of the Transaction costs for €(55.7) million, - €424.7 million in connection with the repayment of existing debt of Banijay, consisting of the early redemption premium (€7.3 million) and refinancing of Banijay’s historical debt of €417.4 million as of September 30, 2019 (€405.9 million recorded under long-term borrowings and other financial liabilities and €11.5 million recorded under short-term borrowings and bank overdrafts) after reversing through the income statement the unamortized portion of the related debt issuance costs (€7.1 million); - €1,598.0 million in connection with the repayment of existing debt of Endemol Shine, consisting of €1,473.2 million recorded under long-term borrowings and other financial liabilities and €124.7 million recorded under short-term borrowings and bank overdrafts. These adjustments conducted to the following impacts: (a) €124.6 million increase in the “cash and cash equivalents” in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019 as a result of (i) €2,147.3 million of the issuing of the new debt, (ii) €424.7 million of the repayment of existing debt of Banijay and (iii) €1,598.0 million of the repayment of existing debt of Endemol Shine. (b) Reduction of the equity of Banijay to give effect to (i) the redemption costs of the existing Notes of €(7.3) million and (ii) the amortization in full of €7.1 million of capitalized debt issuance costs related to indebtedness refinanced pursuant to the refinancing. (c) €320.9 million increase in the “long-term borrowings and other financial liabilities” and €131.7 million decrease in the “short-term borrowings and bank overdraft” in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019 as a consequence of (i) €2,147.3 million corresponding to issuance of new debt amounting to €2,203.0 million and the amortization of the Transaction costs for €(55.7) million, (ii) refinancing of Banijay’s historical debt of €(410.3) million in connection with the repayment of existing debt of Banijay, and (iii) €(1,598.0) million in connection with the repayment of existing debt of Endemol Shine. The following pro forma adjustments were reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statements: (d) Interest expenses were recorded for Endemol Shine in the amount of €(133.4) million, €(100.8) million and €(110.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Such interest expense consists of (i) interest expenses related to indebtedness of Endemol Shine that will be repaid and cancelled in connection with the Transactions for €(130.7) million, €(95.4) million and €(108.9)million; (ii) amortization fees related to the former refinancing of Endemol Shine for €(19.1) million, €(14.1) million and €(15.7) million and (iii) the write-off of the mark to market value of Endemol Shine’s interest rate swaps for €16.5 million, €8.7 million and €14.4 million, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Accordingly, a corresponding adjustment is reflected for each period to reverse the historical interest expense of Endemol Shine for these periods. (e) Other finance income (costs) were recorded in the amount of €(48.6) million, €(33.0) million and €(38.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. These other finance costs related to foreign exchange impacts on the indebtedness of Endemol Shine. Accordingly, a corresponding adjustment is reflected for each period to reverse the historical finance costs of Endemol Shine for these periods. 116 ----- (f) Interest expenses were recorded in the amount of €(1.3) million, €3.7 million and €(14.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. These interests are made of (i) interests expenses related to indebtedness of Banijay that will be repaid and cancelled in connection with the Transactions for €(17.5) million, €(13.2) million and €(12.8) million; (ii) amortization fees related to the former refinancing for €(2.4) million, €(1.8) million and €(1.9) million and (iii) the write-off of the financing Transaction costs for €18.7 million, €18.7 million and €0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Accordingly, a corresponding adjustment is reflected for each period to reverse the historical interest expense of Banijay Group for these periods. Income taxes were computed on this adjustment using the corporate tax rate of 28% for €(0.4) million, €1.0 million and €(4.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. These interest expenses will be replaced by interest expenses associated with the EUR Term Loan B, the USD Term Loan B, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Euro Senior Secured Notes, the Dollar Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes in connection with the Transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019, interest expenses for new indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions were recorded in an aggregate of € million, € million and € million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a change in interest expense of €2.2 million, €1.7 million and €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. The following table presents interest expenses included in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2019, other than interest expenses on new indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions:",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

(g) The estimated costs related to the acquisition of Endemol Shine mainly include banking, legal and consulting fees and amount to €75.0 million, of which €58.3 million are related to the new indebtedness issuance and amortized over the duration period of the debt. As a result, interest expenses were recorded in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statements for €10.7 million, €8.0 million and €8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively. No income taxes deductions have been computed in connection with the new indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions, as Banijay determined that there was not sufficient visibility on the potential future tax deductions of these interest expenses and the capacity to benefit from those tax deductions in future taxable income. 117 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,280,UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,280.77,,280.77.1,,"The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is presented to illustrate the effects of the Transactions on the historical balance sheet and income statements of Banijay and Endemol Shine. The Transactions consist of the Endemol Shine Acquisition, the repayment of certain existing debt of Endemol Shine in connection with the Endemol Shine Acquisition, the Equity Contribution, the Acquisition Financing and the Refinancing, each as further described in Note 1 (Description of the Transactions) to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information. The Refinancing is an integral part of the Transactions, and will occur prior to the completion of the Endemol Shine Acquisition. See also “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of _Proceeds.”_ The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies and presentation adopted by Banijay in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, and is comprised of: (i) the 2018 Full-Year Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statement, (ii) the 2018 Interim Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statement; (iii) the 2019 Interim Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statement (together with the 2018 FullYear Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statement and the 2018 Interim Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statement, the “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statements”, each of which gives pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2018; and (iv) the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet, which gives pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred as of September 30, 2019 (together with the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statements, the “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information”). The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information is based upon available information, including preliminary estimates that are subject to change once more detailed information is obtained, and certain assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. For example, historical interest expenses in connection with indebtedness of Endemol Shine and Banijay that will be repaid and cancelled in connection with the Transactions will be replaced by interest expenses associated with the Senior Facilities and the Notes and, accordingly, an adjustment is reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statements to reverse the historical interest expense of Endemol Shine and Banijay for these periods. The pro forma adjustments in the Unaudited _Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information in this preliminary offering memorandum do not include interest_ expenses on the Senior Facilities, Euro Senior Secured Notes, Dollar Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes. We will update the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information in the final offering memorandum to reflect the pro forma adjustments on interest expenses using the actual interest rates for the Senior Facilities, Euro Senior Secured Notes, Dollar Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes when available. In addition, the Endemol Shine Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires determination of the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the closing date to record identified acquired assets and assumed liabilities at fair value. As of the date of the offering memorandum, we have not estimated the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed for purposes of the preliminary purchase accounting of Endemol Shine. The purchase accounting may result in significant adjustments to the historical values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, resulting in significant increase in depreciation and amortization expense. See Note 3.1 (Preliminary Purchase Accounting Adjustments) to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information for a further discussion of the purchase accounting reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information and its impact on earnings. In addition, transactions that occurred between Banijay and Endemol Shine were deemed as intercompany transactions and the revenues and expenses resulting from these intercompany transactions were eliminated in the Unaudited Pro _Forma Consolidated Financial Information. See Note 3.4 (Intercompany Eliminations). Moreover, the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not reflect any cost savings, other synergies or revenue_ enhancements that the Combined Group may achieve as a result of the Endemol Shine Acquisition, the costs to integrate the operations of Banijay and Endemol Shine or the costs necessary to achieve such cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements. Accordingly, the estimates and assumptions reflected in the Unaudited Pro _Forma Consolidated Financial Information may be materially different from the Combined Group’s actual or_ future results. In the tabular presentation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet and of the Unaudited _Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statements:_ - the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019 and the Consolidated Income Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 of Banijay have been extracted 101 ----- from the Unaudited Interim Banijay Financial Statements and the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2018 of Banijay has been extracted from the Audited Banijay Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018; - the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019 and the Consolidated Income Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 of Endemol Shine have been extracted from the Unaudited Interim Endemol Shine Financial Statements, and the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2018 of Endemol Shine has been extracted from the Audited Endemol Shine Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, and in each case have been reclassified as disclosed in Note 2.1 (Reclassifications) below, in order to align them with the mapping of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information for Banijay.

Our creative talents are a key element of our success and are constantly working to address customers’ demands or to anticipate trends in the industry. We work with our customers to develop original formats that may become long-running programs if they receive good ratings, making them a success. Periods in which we and our customers have successfully anticipated trends produce more favorable results. Usually a successful program will run until viewers’ preferences change or until broadcasters decide to replace the program, in which case they may ask us to develop a new format. If a new program is successful, this will have a positive effect on the profitability of the local production company that produced the program, since broadcasters will typically renew the program for several seasons. In addition, it will have a positive impact on the Group’s revenues, since a popular program in one country will often be successful in other countries with a similar audience, either by the production in such country by one of our production companies or by licensing the format to third-party production companies in the countries where we are not present. For the year ended December 31, 2018, new shows accounted for 32.2% of our production revenues and we generated 26.3% of our production revenues from programs that have aired for a period between two and five seasons and 41.5% of our production revenues from programs that have aired for more than five seasons. Non-scripted formats benefit from lower production costs, a shorter development period and more advantageous financing arrangements, because the broadcaster who purchases the non-scripted format fully funds production costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated 85.9% of our production revenue from non-scripted programs. Our ability to accurately anticipate new trends and/or changes in consumer preferences and needs, as well as focus our development efforts towards that goal, gives us the opportunity to potentially create the next television blockbuster and accordingly will positively impact our revenues. However, our revenues from broadcaster sales will not be negatively impacted if a new program is not successful because the initial price for the sale of the program is not determined based on its success. Different factors are taken into account when determining a program’s price. The budget that the broadcaster wishes to allocate for the relevant time slot is a key element (since budgets are lower for day time slots than they are for access prime-time or prime-time slots). The pricing also takes into account production costs based on the type of program and the format fee payable for the format rights. The average format fee differs from one country to another but, in our experience, is usually between 5% and 7% of the production budget. In addition, the format fee will be higher if the format is successful and/or has already been successfully aired in certain markets. The price of a program is also based on our bargaining power with broadcasters. Even if a program is not successful in a specific market, we will try to produce the format in another market where we are present or license it to another producer in markets where we do not operate. We can also distribute the program through our Banijay Rights Limited subsidiary and continue to derive distribution and secondary revenues from that program.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Because of these higher production costs, scripted programs also tend to generate lower margins than non-scripted programs, but they can deliver higher revenues, 121 ----- particularly future intellectual property revenues when we manage to retain part of the intellectual property rights. We believe our split between scripted and non-scripted content is generally well-suited to our operations, and while we may seek to slightly increase the proportion of revenue generated by our scripted programs in the coming years, we do not expect to invest significantly to develop our scripted content business, as we expect that third-party funding sources will largely incur the upfront investment costs and that we will benefit from the existing catalogue’s distribution revenue. The financing of scripted programs requires financing commitments from broadcasters and co-producers but also from distributors which may be our distribution subsidiary, Banijay Rights Limited. We may therefore be required to prefund development costs for a scripted program. The timing of the upfront payments and final payments, as well as the participation of Banijay Rights Limited in the financing of scripted programs impact our working capital requirements. In addition, we rely on tax credits in certain jurisdictions as part of the financing of a scripted program. However, we may only be able to claim such tax credits after having finalized the production of the program, which may require the Group to prefund a larger share of the upfront production costs and capital expenditures. Changes in working capital are impacted by the timing of a production and program delivery and by the production of scripted and non-scripted programs. Since non-scripted programs are mainly produced in less than a year, working capital requirements related to our non-scripted business are mainly impacted by fluctuations in the numbers of non-scripted programs we produce. We may record cut-off impacts related to non-scripted activity at the end of each year if some large-scale programs are still under production. On the other hand, scripted productions have a longer production cycle, usually over two years, and higher working capital requirements. Our working capital related to scripted activity can be impacted significantly by cut-off issues at the end of the year.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The number of broadcasters has increased in recent years, which in turn has increased the number of customers available to purchase our programs. At the same time broadcasters are facing increasing competition from companies that deliver video content over the internet, commonly referred to as over-the-top or “OTT programming.” With the growth of OTT programming, viewers’ video content consumption preferences may shift away from broadcasters and existing viewing habits. Younger viewers have already started to shift toward using mobile devices or computers rather than televisions. As a result, many of our customers and potential customers are compelled to find new original formats and programs to deliver content to viewers via the internet. We expect this pressure to become even greater as digital platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video continue to grow. We expect to benefit from this customer diversification as we have historical relationships with many broadcasters and have already developed strong commercial relationships with digital platforms. We expect this diversification to continue as OTT companies increasingly focus on non-scripted content, a genre in which we have strong production know-how. In addition, we are increasingly focusing on formats or programs which, once produced for a local market, can be sold or licensed internationally to customers in other markets, such as broadcasters or digital platforms.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

We distribute and license the content we own through Banijay Rights Limited to a traditional customer base of television broadcasters and to digital platforms. Our distribution business generates revenues with high margins because we have limited costs in connection with managing our portfolio of existing programs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our distribution and secondary business generated revenues of €110.7 million, which represented 13.4% of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our distribution business generated an Adjusted EBITDA of €19.7 million, which represented 16.7% of our total Adjusted EBITDA. We intend to further develop our distribution business and develop other sources of secondary revenues, such as revenues from advertising, live entertainment or branded content.

This creates a mismatch between the revenues we actually receive in connection with such sale and the revenues recognized in our financial statements. For example, we occasionally receive production 122 ----- advances from broadcasters before production is complete and these advances are not recognized in our revenues until the delivery of the program. As of September 30, 2019, we had received production advances in the amount of €192.0 million relating to programs delivered or to be delivered in the last quarter of 2019 or in 2020. In addition, we have entered into contracts for a period longer than a year with some of our customers in France and the Nordic Countries. Broadcasters can also decide to make changes to a program during the production process, which may cause delays in the delivery of the program and therefore impact our revenues. In addition, we offer our customers a period of time during which they can reject or return our programs and until the expiration of this period, we may not be able to recognize the related revenues. Accordingly, our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period and the results of one period may not be representative of the results of any future period.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

We generally focus on acquiring companies with specific creative talents, such as a popular host or successful producer, and structure our acquisitions to incentivize such talents to continue to work for us and to create further value. For example, since the completion of the Bear Grylls Acquisition, we control the production of all shows featuring Bear Grylls. To that effect, we enter into various earn-outs or put option agreements with certain of these talents, who are often the sellers of the targets. Payments pursuant to earn-outs or put options are generally contingent and calculated based on the performance of the acquired company over a specified time period following the acquisition. This period generally corresponds to an exclusivity period during which the key managers and creative talents agree to work exclusively for us. The key commercial points include the performance metrics underlying the contingent payments, the earn-out or put option period (usually in an eight-year range), and the timing and the structure of the contingent payment. We account for these earn-outs and put options as a financial liability on our balance sheet rather than financial debt, because the amounts owed under these incentive agreements vary depending on the performance of the business and because they do not bear interest. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations and _Contingent Liabilities.” If the opportunity arises, we may also decide to acquire companies in order to own the_ intellectual property rights to their catalogue of formats and programs. For example, since the completion of the Castaway Acquisition, we own the intellectual property rights to the Survivor format. Following the completion of the Endemol Shine Acquisition, we will further expand our catalogue of formats and programs, including on a more global basis. We may also acquire intellectual property rights without acquiring a production company. For example, we acquired in October 2016 the intellectual property rights and contracts associated with the popular game show The Legacy (known as Les 12 Coups de Midi in France and L’Eredità in Italy). In December 2018, we also acquired the intellectual property rights to the Intervilles format and its derivatives (including Jeux sans _frontières), which has been relaunched in Italy, Spain and Greece and will soon be relaunched in France. We also_ establish joint ventures with popular local producers and talents to develop new production companies in certain markets. For example, we launched Banijay Asia in April 2018, a joint venture in India with a local partner. If a joint venture is successful, we may acquire the remaining share capital in the production company based on a pre-agreed price calculation formula. In the event that a joint venture is not successful and incurs significant losses, we try to negotiate clauses in the related agreement with the other party to limit any potential losses we may incur in connection with such joint venture. Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several ways. First, our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired entity into our consolidated results. Second, the results of the acquired businesses after their acquisition may be positively affected by synergies. Additionally, we may experience an increase in operating expenses, such as staff costs, as we integrate the acquired business into our Group. Finally, because acquired entities are consolidated from their date of acquisition, the full impact of an acquisition or disposal is only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Broadcasters’ purchases of licenses for our formats and programs have grown through various economic cycles because viewers continue to watch television and demand new content throughout such cycles. However, broadcasters generate lower advertisement revenues during economic downturns and therefore may try to reduce their budgets allocated to the purchase or production of new programs. During these periods, broadcasters 123 ----- become more risk averse and are reluctant to finance the production of untested, new programs to a certain extent.

According to Oliver & Ohlbaum, the global television industry was valued at approximately €386 billion in 2018 and revenues are projected to reach approximately €389 billion in 2019. The industry’s key revenue streams which include pay TV subscriptions, advertising, license fees and subscriptions and licensing fees from SVOD use, are all expected to continue growing from 2019 to 2023 at a CAGR of approximately 1.9%. The global content production industry was valued at approximately €158 billion in 2018, representing approximately 41% of global television industry revenues. Content production revenues have grown in recent years and are projected to continue growing at a CAGR of approximately 4.7% from the period between 2020 to 2025. We expect growth in the television production market in terms of revenues to continue to be influenced by viewership levels and customers’ demand for new programs in order to reach as many viewers as possible, particularly via digital platforms that are available on mobile devices as video consumption continues to increase partly due to a shift from viewings on television to mobile phones and tablets. We also expect customers’ demand for original formats and programs in emerging markets to continue to be driven by a growing middle class.

We are exposed to both transactional and translational risk due to these fluctuations. Transactional risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than their functional currency. We currently have production companies in 16 countries. As a result, we generate a significant portion of our revenues and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than euro, our reporting currency. The primary currencies in which we generated revenues in the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, were the euro, the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling. Where we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, our results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. For example, a stronger euro will increase the cost of euro-denominated supplies for our non-euro businesses and conversely decrease the cost of non-euro supplies for our euro businesses. Our subsidiaries generally execute their sales to broadcasters and digital platforms and incur most of their materials costs in the same currency. As a result, we currently do not seek to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments, except in connection with a few local productions. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 16.0% of our revenues were generated in U.S. dollars and 12.0% of our revenues was generated in GBP. We also face translational currency exchange risk. We present our consolidated financial statements in euro. As a result, we must translate the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency other than euro into euro at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of these currencies against the euro may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, income and expenses with respect to our non-euro businesses in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency, which creates translation risk. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. For example, because we prepare our consolidated financial statements in euro, the decrease of the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro, pound sterling and other major currencies in 2018 negatively affected our reported results of operations.

Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Rights-of-use of leases are being amortized over the contracts’ duration. As a consequence, lease expenses have been restated from external expenses while higher financial interests and depreciation and amortization have been recognized. In addition, IFRS 16 has impacted the presentation of our cash flow statement. Actual lease payments, which were previously part of operating profit / (loss) or movements in payables within net cash generated from operating activities, have now been classified into a payment of lease liability within financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities have been positively impacted and cash flows from financing activities have been negatively impacted. Though presented in different parts of the consolidated cash flow statement, actual total pre-tax cash payments remain unchanged. We have elected to use the exemptions on short-term and low-value leases. We have adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. As of January 1, 2019, the impact of IFRS 16 adoption led to a provisional impact of €68.4 million of both right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, with therefore no impact in the net equity. Discounted rates are an area of significant judgement and estimation, particularly given the term of our leases, which have an average duration of 5.3 years as of September 30, 2019. The weighted average discount rate applied to the lease liabilities on January 1, 2019, was 2.4%. Had we adopted IFRS 16 on January 1, 2018, we estimate that the implementation of IFRS 16 would have resulted in an increase of €13.2 million in EBITDA as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. This estimate is based on our leases as of January 1, 2019, excluding the contribution from Brainpool, and the impact of IFRS 16 on our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This information may not be indicative of the impact of the first application of IFRS 16 on our right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and EBITDA for any future period. In implementing IFRS 16, we prepared the Unaudited Interim Banijay Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. Accordingly, our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (which were prepared after the first application of IFRS 16) are limited in comparability to our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 (which were prepared before the first application of IFRS 16).",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,1362,BANIJAY’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,1362.2,Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements,1362.2.2,Acquisitions,"We have completed a number of selective acquisitions of varying sizes from 2016 to the date of this offering memorandum, which impact the comparability of our financial results between periods. Since we consolidate the results of operations of each acquired business in our financial statements from the completion date of each acquisition, our historical financial periods are not directly comparable to one another. Following the closing date of an acquisition, our results are consolidated with the results of the acquired business, and are thereafter impacted by the revenues and expenses of the acquired business. See “—Factors Affecting Our Results of _Operations—Acquisitions and Joint Ventures.” As we continually assess our markets for opportunistic_ acquisitions of similar businesses to grow our business, including in connection with the Endemol Shine Acquisition, our financial statements in the future will vary from our historical consolidated financial statements contained in this offering memorandum. Set forth below are brief descriptions of certain of our significant acquisitions since the beginning of 2016. _Banijay Zodiak Merger_ On February 23, 2016, we completed the Banijay Zodiak Merger, a reverse merger pursuant to which Banijay Holding, the holding company of the Group prior to the Banijay Zodiak Merger, was merged into Zodiak, which was renamed Banijay Group S.A.S. upon completion of the reverse merger. However, under reverse acquisition accounting principles, Banijay Holding is treated as the accounting acquirer and Zodiak is treated as the accounting acquiree. As a result, the audited consolidated financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes (i) the operations of the accounting acquirer (Banijay Holding) from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, and (ii) the operations of the legal parent (the Senior Notes Issuer, formerly Zodiak) from February 23, 2016, the date of the completion of the Banijay Zodiak Merger, to December 31, 2016. See note 6.2 to the Audited Banijay Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Therefore, the Senior Notes Issuer’s 125 ----- financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, do not fully represent the results of operations and financial condition of the entire business and the comparability of these financial statements with the financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, presented in this offering memorandum is limited. _Brainpool_ In December 2018, our subsidiary, Banijay Germany, took control over Brainpool following a reorganization in the management team of that entity, and as a result Brainpool has been fully consolidated for the purpose of the financial statements (including the balance sheet) of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2018. Therefore, the Senior Notes Issuer’s financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, do not fully represent the results of operations and financial condition of the entire business and the comparability of these financial statements with the financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, presented in this offering memorandum is limited. As of September 30, 2019, we owned 50% of the outstanding share capital of Brainpool. _Bear Grylls_ In October 2019, the Senior Notes Issuer acquired 51.0% of the issued and outstanding share capital of The Natural Studios, the direct parent company of BGV Media Limited.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

(b) Our historical consolidated statement of profit or loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were prepared under IAS 17, and our historical consolidated statement of profit or loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was prepared under IFRS 16. Depreciation prepared on an IAS 17 basis represents depreciation, excluding depreciation of right-of-use assets that were accounted for as operating leases prior to the first application of IFRS 16. Amortization prepared on an IAS 17 basis represents amortization, excluding amortization of lease premiums which, following the first application of IFRS 16, are included within right-of-use assets on our balance sheet, with depreciation charged accordingly. _Revenues_ Revenue increased by €88.9 million, or 16.2%, from €548.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to €637.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to (i) changes in the scope of consolidation, which had a positive impact of €69.7 million on our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, mainly due to the consolidation of Brainpool in Germany in December 2018 (€45.1 million), the integration of Shauna Events (€12.2 million) and the acquisitions of PortoCabo, Good Times, ITV Movie and Screen Media (collectively, €12.2 million), (ii) the organic growth of our business (€30.3 million), driven by the timing of delivery of certain programs and new productions in 2019, and which was partly offset by programs not renewed, and (iii) positive foreign exchange impact (€4.2 million) driven by favorable fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate, partially offset by negative changes in the EUR/SEK exchange rate. 128 ----- This increase in revenue occurred despite the unfavorable (on a comparable basis) non-recurrence in 2019 of two one-off events that had a net positive impact of €15.2 million in 2018, namely: (i) the revenue contribution of a significant intellectual property license over a seven-year period, which was recognized in full in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and (ii) the delivery of the third season of Versailles, one of our leading scripted international programs. _Operating Expenses, External Expenses and Staff Costs_ Operating expenses, external expenses and staff costs increased by €66.3 million, or 14.2%, from €467.7 million, or 85.3% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to €533.9 million, or 83.7% of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the operating expenses, external expenses and staff costs of Brainpool, which was consolidated in our results of operations in December 2018, and to the growth of our business. This increase was partly offset by the impact of IFRS 16 (€11.6 million). _Depreciation and Amortization of Intangible and Tangible Assets_ Depreciation and amortization of intangible and tangible assets increased by €4.6 million, or 14.2%, from €32.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to €37.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the impact of IFRS 16 (€11.3 million), partly offset by the negative impact (€5.9 million) of more fiction programs being delivered and amortized in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, due to the seasonality of scripted production. _Current Impairment Losses And Provisions, Net of Reversals_ Current impairment losses and provisions, net of reversals increased by €0.1 million, or 13.0%, from €0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to €0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the reversal of provisions related to bad debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, following payments from customers. _Other Current Operating Income (Expenses)_ Other current operating income/expenses increased by €0.4 million, from an expense of €0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to an income of €0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the reclassification of the profit share to ITV in Castaway from other current operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. _Other Non-Current Operating Income (Expenses)_ Other non-current operating expenses decreased by €12.0 million, or 58.5%, from €20.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to €8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the non-recurrence of the costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, following the cancellation of Koh Lanta during its nineteenth season (the French version of Survivor) after an incident between two contestants in 2018. This decrease was partly offset by severance costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. _Interest Expenses_ Interest expenses decreased by €1.6 million, or 8.9%, from €18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to €16.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the interest accrued during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, on a shareholder loan that was repaid in full in December 2018. _Other Finance Income (Costs)_ Other finance costs increased by €0.4 million from €5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to €5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to a financial expense of €1.2 million related to IFRS 16 in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, partly offset by higher interest income on current accounts with equity investments. 129 ----- _Income Taxes_ Income taxes increased by €7.0 million, from €4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. We computed income tax expense for the ninemonth periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 using the projected effective tax rate method (based on the latest approved budget after certain restatements related to our long-term incentive plan), after restating the profit/(loss) before tax from certain selected items with no tax impact. _Profit (Loss) for the Year_ Profit for the year increased by €25.5 million, from a loss of €2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to a profit of €22.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the reasons stated above.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Accordingly, decreases in cost items are shown as positive changes in the change in value column, and negative changes in the percentage change (%) column, and increases in cost items are shown as negative changes in the change in value column, and positive changes in the percentage change (%) column. _Revenues_ Revenues decreased by €20.0 million, or 2.4%, from €846.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €826.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an adverse foreign exchange impact of €17.0 million, mainly on the EUR/USD and EUR/SEK foreign exchange rates, and a negative impact of €45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, following the cancellation of certain 130 ----- significant programs (such as Koh Lanta in France following an incident between two contestants, El Programa _de Ana Rosa in Spain following the departure from Cuarzo of Ana Rosa Quintana and the cancellation of Project Runway in the United States). This decrease was partly offset by a change in scope of consolidation, which had a_ positive impact of €23.0 million on our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to the acquisition of PortoCabo in Spain, Wonder Television in the United Kingdom, Terence Films and Shauna Events in France, and by the organic growth of our business, which had a net positive impact of €19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Operating Expenses, External Expenses and Staff Costs_ Operating expenses, external expenses and staff costs decreased by €30.4 million, or 4.2%, from €725.7 million, or 85.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €695.3 million, or 84.1% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower production revenues as well as lower expenses in connection with our long-term incentive plan, following a review of this plan in 2018. _Depreciation and Amortization of Intangible and Tangible Assets_ Depreciation and amortization of intangible and tangible assets increased by €3.7 million, or 7.2%, from €50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €54.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher amortization of fiction production costs in connection with higher intellectual property sales of fiction formats over the period. This increase was also due to a reversal of impairment in 2017 in connection with a provision of the former Zodiak business that was depreciated at the time of the Banijay Zodiak Merger, and which did not recur in 2018. _Current Impairment Losses and Provisions, Net of Reversals_ Current impairment losses and provisions net of reversals decreased by €2.2 million from an income of €1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to an expense of €1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to allowances for doubtful accounts, primarily in the United States. _Other Current Operating Income and Expenses_ Other current operating income and expenses increased by €0.3 million, or 18.8% from an expense of €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to an expense of €1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the share of the profits before tax from Castaway due to ITV in the United Kingdom. _Other Non-Current Operating Income (Expenses)_ Other non-current operating expenses increased by €14.5 million from €8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the cancellation of Koh Lanta during its nineteenth season (the French version of Survivor) and, to a lower extent, higher acquisition costs in 2018. _Interest Expenses_ Interest expenses increased by €1.2 million, or 5.1%, from €23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the refinancing completed in July 2017, which resulted in higher interest expenses for the full year 2018, partly offset by the write-off of transaction costs incurred in connection with our previous financing arrangements in 2017 and not recurring in 2018. _Other Finance Income (Costs)_ Other finance income/costs increased by €4.4 million from a finance income of €3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to finance costs of €1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to (i) a positive net impact of €7.0 million in 2017, which did not recur in 2018, related to the refinancing of certain convertible bonds subscribed in February 2016 by a subsidiary of Vivendi and (ii) a 131 ----- negative foreign exchange impact of €1.0 million. This decrease was partly offset by the net positive impact of €4.1 million following a change in valuation of earn-out rights resulting from an update of our business plan and of the discount rate applied to such rights. _Income Taxes_ Income taxes decreased by €5.7 million, from an expense of €15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to an expense of €9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease of the federal income tax rate in the United States from 35% to 21%, which resulted in a positive impact of €1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the lower basis of profit before tax in the United States and in France. _Profit (Loss) for the Year_ Profit (loss) for the year decreased by €12.4 million, or 49.1%, from €25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the reasons described above.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Accordingly, decreases in cost items are shown as positive changes in the change in value column, and negative changes in the percentage change (%) column, and increases in cost items are shown as negative changes in the change in value column, and positive changes in the percentage change (%) column. 132 ----- _Revenues_ Revenues increased by €120.1 million, or 16.5%, from €726.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €846.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily related to a change in scope of consolidation, which had a positive impact of €62.0 million on our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly attributable to the Banijay Zodiak Merger (amounting to €43.2 million) as well as the consolidation of Castaway, L’Officina and DRY Media in Italy. This increase was also due to the organic growth of our business, which had a net positive impact of €67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly in the United States with new programs sold to Netflix (Bill Nye) or Facebook Watch (Ball in the Family) and in France with a new daily game show sold to France Télévisions “Tout le monde a son mot à dire.” This increase was partly offset by an adverse foreign exchange impact for €9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly on the EUR/GBP and EUR/USD foreign exchange rates. _Operating Expenses, External Expenses and Staff Costs_ Operating expenses, external expenses and staff costs increased by €116.8 million, or 19.2%, from €608.9 million, or 83.8% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €725.7 million, or 85.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to growth of our business in connection with the increase in revenues described above, the full-year impact of the integration of Zodiak and to an increase in expenses related to our long-term incentive plans for certain key managers of the Group, which we implemented in 2017 (see “Management—Remuneration and Other Benefits”). This increase was partially offset by the positive impact of costs savings related to synergies implemented in 2016 following the Banijay Zodiak Merger. _Depreciation and Amortization of Intangible and Tangible Assets_ Depreciation and amortization of intangible and tangible assets increased by €14.7 million, or 40.8%, from €36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the Banijay Zodiak Merger (amounting to €8.1 million) and to the development of our scripted business, which led to higher depreciation of our production costs. _Current Impairment Losses and Provisions, Net of Reversals_ Current impairment losses and provisions, net of reversals, decreased by €7.4 million from a loss of €6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to an income of €1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the reversal of provisions related to loss-making contracts and bad debt for the year ended December 31, 2017, and to a change in the estimated future revenues from our existing catalogue of programs following the completion of the Banijay Zodiak Merger, which had an impact of €4.8 million on our current impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2016, and did not recur in 2017. _Other Current Operating Income and Expenses_ Other current operating income and expenses decreased by €4.2 million from an income of €2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to an expense of €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of the share of the profits before tax from Castaway due to ITV in the United Kingdom in 2017, as well as to showrunner costs incurred in the United States for our program Versailles in 2017. _Other Non-Current Operating Income (Expenses)_ Other non-current operating expenses decreased by €18.1 million, or 68.6%, from €26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to non-current operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2016, due to restructuring costs incurred in connection with the Banijay Zodiak Merger. _Interest Expenses_ Interest expenses increased by €9.4 million, or 65.6%, from €14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to (i) the 133 ----- refinancing completed in February 2016 in connection with the Banijay Zodiak Merger, which resulted in higher interest expenses for the first half of 2017, (ii) the interest on the Existing Notes and Existing Senior Credit Facilities for the second half of 2017, and (iii) the amortization of the transaction costs of the refinancing in 2017. _Other Finance Income (Costs)_ Other finance income/costs decreased by €17.2 million from finance costs of €13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to finance income of €3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a positive net impact of €7.0 million in 2017 related to the refinancing of certain convertible bonds subscribed in February 2016 by a subsidiary of Vivendi, (ii) a positive variation in foreign exchange rates of €2.6 million and (iii) an impact of €2.8 million from a change in valuation of earn-out rights resulting from an update of our business plan and to the discount rate applied to such rights. _Income Taxes_ Income taxes increased by €17.4 million from an income of €2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to an expense of €15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the recognition in 2016 of carried-forward tax losses of the Zodiak and its subsidiaries following the Banijay Zodiak Merger. _Profit (Loss) for the Year_ Profit (loss) for the year increased by €2.8 million, or 12.7%, from €22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis has been our generation of cash flow from operations and drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, non-recourse factoring agreements, production financings and other corporate liquidity resources. Following the Transactions, our principal source of liquidity is expected to be our cash flow from operations, as well as drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility, non-recourse factoring agreements, production financings and other corporate liquidity resources. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily to fund acquisitions, meet our debt service obligations, fund our working capital needs and, to a lesser extent, fund capital expenditures. Our ability to generate sufficient cash for our ongoing operations depends on our operating performance, which in turn depends, to some extent, on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” We believe that, based on our current level of operations as reflected in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, our cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand and the availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditures and debt service for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet such financing needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes, the Senior Facilities or on our other debt when due. If our cash flow from operating activities are lower than expected, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms to us, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depend on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions and capital markets, restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and our general financial performance. On the Issue Date, we will have access to funds under the Revolving Credit Facility, the availability of which will be subject to certain conditions. Giving effect to the Refinancing only, the amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be €75.0 million (equivalent), and giving further effect to the remainder of the Transactions, the amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be €170.0 million 134 ----- (equivalent).

This decrease was primarily due to the seasonality of our productions, in particular following the growth in our scripted business in the Nordic Countries, with shows expected to be delivered in the last quarter of 2019, partly offset by a positive impact related to the first application of IFRS 16 of €10.5 million.

This increase was primarily due to the positive effect of the organic growth of our business and of change in working capital driven by improvement in working capital requirements due to a favorable timing of invoicing and the continuous implementation of a disciplined cash collection approach at the level of our operating subsidiaries.

This decrease was primarily due to the negative effect of change in working capital driven by the deliveries of capital intensive scripted productions as well as certain tax credits not yet cashed in and growth in our business.

Changes in working capital are impacted by the timing of production and program delivery and by the production of scripted and non-scripted programs.

We may record cut-off impacts related to non-scripted activity at the end of each year if some large-scale programs are still under production. On the other hand, scripted productions have longer production cycles, usually over two years, and higher working capital requirements. Our working capital related to scripted activity can be impacted significantly by cut-off issues at the end of the year.

In connection with the acquisition of companies in various jurisdictions, we have entered into, and will continue to enter into, earn-outs or put option agreements with certain key managers and creative talents of these companies, when they are the sellers of such companies, to incentivize them to continue to work with us following the relevant acquisition. Although we do not use a standard earn-out agreement across all such acquisitions, payments pursuant to such earn-outs are generally contingent and are calculated based on the performance of the acquired company over a specified time period following the acquisition. This period also corresponds to an exclusivity period during which key managers or creative talent agree to work exclusively for our Group. We usually pay a portion of the acquisition purchase price on the acquisition completion date and the remaining portion in installments over the exclusivity period, which vary based on the performance of the acquired company. The key commercial points involved in negotiating these earn-out agreements are the performance metric on which we base the contingent payments, the establishment of the earn-out period (usually in an eight-year range), and the timing and the structure of the contingent payments. As of September 30, 2019, we had €60.9 million of other long-term and other current liabilities to reflect earn-outs and put option agreements that remain outstanding.

In connection with the acquisition of companies in various jurisdictions, we have entered into, and will continue to enter into, earn-outs or put option agreements with certain key managers and creative talents of these companies, when they are the sellers of such companies, to incentivize them to continue to work with us following the relevant acquisition. Although we do not use a standard earn-out agreement across all such acquisitions, payments pursuant to such earn-outs are generally contingent and are calculated based on the performance of the acquired company over a specified time period following the acquisition. This period also corresponds to an exclusivity period during which key managers or creative talent agree to work exclusively for our Group. We usually pay a portion of the acquisition purchase price on the acquisition completion date and the remaining portion in installments over the exclusivity period, which vary based on the performance of the acquired company. The key commercial points involved in negotiating these earn-out agreements are the performance metric on which we base the contingent payments, the establishment of the earn-out period (usually in an eight-year range), and the timing and the structure of the contingent payments. 139 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flow of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

In addition, operating companies may, under strict conditions, opt for hedging currency risks from firm commitments and forecasted transactions. The currencies giving rise to these risks are primarily the euro, the U.S. dollar and pound sterling. As of December 31, 2018, sales in entities located in the United States represented 16.0% of our revenues. A decrease of 5% or an increase of 5% of the U.S. dollars foreign exchange rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenues of €(6.4) million and €7.1 million, respectively.

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured on the acquisition date, at fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the target. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the target either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the target’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed. When we acquire a business, we assess the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the target. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the target is remeasured to fair value as of the acquisition date through profit and loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognized either in profit or loss or as change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it will not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over our net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of our CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the target are assigned to those units. Where goodwill forms part of a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

If an asset does not generate sufficient independent cash flow, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGUs to which the asset belongs. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market interest rates and the risks specific to the asset. All financial assets are reviewed for impairment. If there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events after initial recognition, an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. The annual impairment tests are performed at year end. The recoverable amount of the CGUs concerned is based on a value-in-use calculation. The model is based on a four-year forecast of discounted cash flows, plus a terminal value. The net discounted cash flows are calculated before tax. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. As for audiovisual rights, they are depreciated on an accelerated basis following the decline in the net value of the asset following its initial broadcast. Other intangible and tangible assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets. The management of the Group uses its experience to estimate the remaining useful life and residual value of an asset. When the recoverable amount of a non-current asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is impaired to its recoverable amount and an impairment charge is recognized in the income statement. An impairment loss is reversed when there has been a change in estimate that is relevant for the determination of the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. 143 ----- The key assumptions in the cash flow projections relate to the market growth for the CGUs and the related revenues projections. The growth assumptions for these cash generating units are based on the growth of the global and regional markets for our products and services.

Audiovisual rights are considered to have a definite useful life. Intangible assets should be depreciated based on the consumption of the associated economic benefits and on the remaining useful life of the asset. Therefore, audiovisual rights are depreciated on an accelerated basis following the decline in the net value of the asset after its initial broadcast. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are depreciated as follows: - catalogue: on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period; and - customer contracts: on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contract. The depreciation period and the amortization method are reviewed at least once per year, generally at the end of the financial year. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected projections of economic benefits of the asset are accounted for by changing the depreciation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at their acquisition cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of such fixed assets.

The number of broadcasters has increased in recent years, which has increased the number of customers available to purchase Endemol Shine’s programs and therefore impacts its revenues. At the same time, broadcasters are facing increasing competition from companies that deliver video content over the internet. With the growth of OTT programming, viewers’ video content consumption preferences may shift away from broadcasters and diverge from existing viewing habits. Younger viewers have already started to shift toward using mobile devices or computers rather than televisions. As a result, many of Endemol Shine’s existing and potential customers are compelled to find new original formats and programs to deliver content to viewers over the internet. Endemol Shine expects this pressure to increase as digital platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video continue to grow, and expects to benefit from this customer diversification. Endemol Shine has historical relationships with many broadcasters and has already developed strong commercial relationships with digital platforms. OTT companies are also increasingly seeking out non-scripted content, a genre in which Endemol Shine has strong production know-how. In addition, Endemol Shine is increasingly focusing on formats or programs which, once produced for a local market, can be sold or licensed internationally to customers in other markets, such as broadcasters or digital platforms (including OTT platforms). Such increased diversification in customers and the resulting opportunities for distribution revenues has historically and will likely continue to impact Endemol Shine’s results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

For example, scripted programs generally require a longer and more extensive development and production process, incurring higher costs and consequently generating lower margins than non-scripted programs. Endemol Shine is continuously focused on improving the cost efficiencies within the production process. To support this goal, Endemol Shine has implemented a flexible organization whereby shows are mainly produced by freelancers with minimal investments in fixed assets. Furthermore, Endemol Shine does not in principle start any production which is not fully funded and committed, thereby limiting its risks of not recovering production costs incurred. One of Endemol Shine’s key strategic priorities for managing its cost structure has been to improve its product mix of scripted and non-scripted programs. By selectively increasing its production of non-scripted programs with a constant focus on efficiency in the production of shows, Endemol Shine has decreased its overall production costs and simultaneously driven margins in its core production business. Endemol Shine believes these initiatives have contributed to EBITDA growth and increased operating cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, and contributed to its margin protection in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 147 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

This creates a mismatch between the revenue amounts Endemol Shine actually receives in connection with such sale and the revenues recognized in its financial statements. For example, Endemol Shine receives production advances from broadcasters before production is complete and these advances are not recognized in its revenues until the final delivery of the program.

Under the new lease standard, assets leased by Endemol Shine are being recognized in the statement of financial position with a corresponding lease liability. Endemol Shine adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019, which impacts the comparability of its financial results between periods. The comparative figures were not required to be, and have not been, restated. Lease contracts that have an impact on Endemol Shine’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements relate to office buildings, car fleet, studios, production related leases and office equipment. The effect of the first application of IFRS 16 had no impact on Endemol Shine’s revenue, while operating result was positively impacted by €2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This was caused by the operating lease expenses in the amount of €20.6 million being replaced by depreciation in the amount of €18.3 million and interest expenses amounting to €3.5 million, of which the latter is not recognized in operating result. In addition, the cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was positively impacted in an amount of €20.6 million, as the operating lease expenses are classified as cash outflow used in financing activities. Had we adopted IFRS 16 on January 1, 2018, we estimate that, based on our leases as of January 1, 2019, the implementation of IFRS 16 would have resulted in an increase of approximately €27 million in EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018. This information may not be indicative of the impact of the first application of IFRS 16 on our right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and EBITDA for any past or future period. Endemol Shine recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for those leases previously classified as operating leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Lease liabilities were recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. The lease payments include (in-substance) fixed payments (less any lease incentives), variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by Endemol Shine and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects Endemol Shine exercising the option to terminate. Endemol Shine recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless Endemol Shine is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment under IAS 36. 148 ----- At the commencement date of the lease, Endemol Shine recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include (in substance) fixed payments (less any lease incentives), variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by Endemol Shine and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects Endemol Shine exercising the option to terminate. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. Endemol Shine applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of twelve months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered of low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Endemol Shine determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. When determining the lease term, Endemol Shine considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. These circumstances include Endemol Shine’s strategic plans, the industrial footprint of Endemol Shine and the importance of the asset to Endemol Shine’s operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The new accounting policies are set out in Note 2 to the Audited Endemol Shine Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 15, Endemol Shine has adopted the modified retrospective approach, as a result of which the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 is recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance as at January 1, 2018. As of January 1, 2018, the adjustment resulting from the transition to IFRS 15 on retained earnings was €6.7 million, an €8.0 million decrease in revenue and a €1.3 million increase in deferred tax liability. Endemol Shine applied the requirements of the new standard only to contracts that were not complete at January 1, 2018. Application of the new revenue recognition standard has no effect on the cash flows that Endemol Shine expects to receive. No other practical expedients were applied for the adoption of IFRS 15. The significant changes from IAS 18/IAS 11 to IFRS 15 are: - Production revenue is recognized on an output method (per program or milestone reached) rather than a percentage of completion method under IAS 11; and - Minimum guarantees are recognized at a point in time as opposed to over time under IAS 18.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The comparative figures were not required to be, and have not been, restated. Therefore, the cumulative impact of the adoption is recognized in retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. Under IFRS 9, the classification and measurement requirements have no material impact on Endemol Shine’s financial statements. Considering the nature of the financial instruments Endemol Shine currently holds (under assets and liabilities), there is no change to current valuations used (at amortized cost or at fair value) and Endemol Shine does not hold financial assets that require measurement at fair value with changes in fair value to be recorded through other comprehensive income under IFRS 9. 149 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Since Endemol Shine consolidates the results of operations of each acquired business in its financial statements from the completion date of each acquisition, its historical financial periods are not directly comparable to one another. Following the closing date of an acquisition, the results of the acquired business are consolidated with the results of Endemol Shine, and are thereafter impacted by the revenues and expenses of the acquired business. In addition, Endemol Shine’s results are affected by other items such as its ability to realize synergies, including in sales and marketing, increases in profit margin due to its application of best practices and costs incurred to consolidate businesses. For example, in 2017, Endemol Shine acquired 100% of No Doubt Productions Inc. in the United States. No Doubt Productions Inc. owns post-production equipment facilities. This acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase of assets as of February 14, 2017. In 2016, Endemol Shine acquired 51% of Wild Mercury Limited in the United Kingdom. Wild Mercury is a scripted production company. In addition, in October 2016, Endemol Shine acquired the remaining 51% of Human Factor B.V., resulting in a 100% ownership in Human Factor B.V. Endemol Shine purchased the remaining shares (30%) in Kemna & Zonen B.V. during 2018 (subsequently renamed to Curtain Call Media B.V.), resulting in a 100% ownership. _Joint Ventures_ Endemol Shine completed a number of joint ventures of varying sizes during the periods presented, which impact the comparability of its financial results between periods. In 2017, Endemol Shine entered into an agreement with Boomdog, a leading independent production company in Mexico, to jointly develop opportunities both locally and in the fast-growing U.S. Spanish-language market. The transaction closed in January 2018. Endemol Shine contributed its Latino activities with an equity value of €2.5 million into the newly founded company Endemol Shine Boomdog LLC (“ES Boomdog Miami”). 49% of the shares in ES Boomdog Miami were sold to Boomdog US Inc., a 100% subsidiary of BDF Productions. In exchange BDF Productions gave up 51% in Endemol Shine Boomdog Holding S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“ES Boomdog Mexico”). ES Boomdog Mexico, a newly founded entity holds a 100% interest in Boomdog Films (now EndemolShine Boomdog S.A.P.I. de C.V.) and Boomdog Studios S.A.P.I. de C.V. The equity value of ES Boomdog Mexico, at the time of the transaction, was approximately zero, which resulted in the creation of goodwill amounting to €1.2 million. _Divestments_ Endemol Shine completed a number of selective divestments of varying sizes during the periods presented, which impact the comparability of its financial results between periods. In 2016, Endemol Shine sold its 90% interest in Endemol Shine Argentina and in Estudio Mayor in connection with refocusing its regional strategy. As of the closing date of a divestment, the results of operations and assets and liabilities attributable to the divested business are classified as discontinued operations, and Endemol Shine’s results are thereafter no longer impacted by the revenues and expenses of the divested business. Divestments may either allow Endemol Shine to generate profit therefrom, which would positively impact its cash position, or otherwise result in lower revenue, impairments of goodwill and a lower amount of total assets on Endemol Shine’s balance sheet. In 2017, Endemol Shine sold its 100% interest in Studios A/S Denmark and Studios AS Norway as part of refocusing its regional strategy and terminated its operations in Turkey and Chile. Endemol Shine also closed down its production activities in its non-core market of Singapore in 2018. Additionally, in 2018, Endemol Shine sold its 100% interest in Endemol Shine South Africa, to local management as part of refocusing on its key markets and its 51% share in Herr P in Germany to the original founder in exchange for an increase in the percentage of net income that Endemol Shine is entitled to receive in connection with its right to distribute for The Brain internationally. 150 ----- _Loss of Control of CORE Entertainment Inc._ On October 17, 2016, the Target completed bankruptcy proceedings with respect to CORE Entertainment Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries. See “Endemol Shine’s Business—Legal Proceedings—Core Media Group.” As a result, CORE Entertainment Holdings Inc.’s shares in CORE Entertainment Inc. were cancelled such that CORE Entertainment Holdings Inc. no longer owns CORE Entertainment Inc. or any of its subsidiaries nor has the right to manage their businesses. The loss of control over these businesses triggered their immediate deconsolidation from the consolidated statement of financial position of the Target as of the date of loss of control, which was October 17, 2016. Therefore, the audited consolidated financial information of the Target as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the operations of CORE Entertainment Inc. and its subsidiaries from January 1, 2016 to October 17, 2016, such that the comparability of these financial statements with the financial statements of the Target as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, presented elsewhere in this offering memorandum, is limited.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

This includes only those amounts to which Endemol Shine is entitled to under the present contract and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The commitment under a contract with a customer to produce a non-scripted or scripted show that consists of a certain number of episodes, including the commitment to grant a license, is considered to be a single performance obligation. When a contract has multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on stand-alone selling prices. This performance obligation will be satisfied over time, given that the customer gains control over the produced content at separate moments during the project, or the content produced does not have an alternative use and Endemol Shine has an enforceable right to payment while the produced content is being transferred. Endemol Shine measures the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation based on output measurement, which can either be the delivery of a program or the reaching of certain milestones specifically stated in the contract. Milestones are considered to be reached once the customer approval has been obtained. Distribution revenue is derived from contracts with customers including a license. Endemol Shine provides a right to use the format or program as they exist at the point in time at which the license is granted to the customer. This means that the customer can direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the license at the point in time at which the license transfers. Endemol Shine does not have any obligations towards improving or renewing the licensed format or program after the beginning of the license date. Therefore, distribution revenue is recognized at a certain point in time. If the transaction price for granting a license is based on usage-based royalties, Endemol Shine recognizes the revenue as the underlying usage occurs. Other revenue is ordinarily recognized in accordance with the substance of the underlying agreement. Revenue from commercial contracts is based on production of content and/or granting a license. Commercial, digital and other revenue is recognized, for example, on the basis of the number of calls or minutes spent on calls, the number of messages sent or received, the amounts of data traffic generated, the number of internet hits, the number of games sold and/or subscriptions sold in relation to the platforms provided. As a result of the application of IFRS 15, since January 1, 2018, the description of revenue in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income was replaced with revenue from contracts with customers.

Endemol Shine’s shows are mainly produced with freelancers requiring minimal investment in fixed assets, which is reflected in the variable nature of cost of Endemol Shine’s cost of sales. Endemol Shine also allocates the amortization of its format and program catalogue as well as the amortization of its brand value to cost of sales. The value of Endemol Shine’s format and program catalogue and brand value has been determined for purposes of the purchase price allocation at the inception of the joint venture structure of Endemol Shine created by Apollo and 21st Century Fox.

Indirect cost of sales relates to activities or services that are not specifically incurred or hired for one project or production but rather benefit more than one project. The precise benefit to a specific project is difficult to allocate. These costs can be fixed or variable and are scrutinized by management to ascertain that the cost structure is adjusted in line with the development of commissioning- and production volume. Overhead costs correspond to cost incurred for activities or services that are required to allow for continuation of the business, but not directly linked to the realization of productions. These costs are expected to be fixed in their vast majority and not subject to phasing through the year.

This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of €18.2 million in distribution revenues from Endemol Shine International Limited in 2019 (due to formats such Troy which did not return in 2019), Endemol Shine France (with Guyane, Papa ou _Maman, The Bridge and The Island which were not renewed in 2019), the non-recommissioning of Big Brother_ in the United Kingdom and timing of delivery of certain programs in the Netherlands and India. This decrease was partly offset by higher revenues in Germany (due to delivery of the second season of Dark), the United States (due to the return of Deal or No Deal and the commissioning of Family Food Fight) and Australia (due to the new commissioning of, for example, Lego Masters, Changing Rooms and the scripted production Lambs of _God) as well as positive foreign exchange effects amounting to €14.1 million in 2019, following the_ strengthening of the U.S. Dollar. _Revenues by Genre_ The following table sets forth Endemol Shine’s revenues by genre for the periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Change in value represents the mathematical difference between the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, as set forth in the table above. Revenues from non-scripted programs increased by €13.1 million, or 1.5%, from €848.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €861.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This 154 ----- increase was primarily due to higher revenues in the United States (as a result of the return of Deal or No Deal and the commissioning of Family Food Fight), Australia (due to the new commissioning of, for example, Lego _Masters, Changing Rooms and the scripted production Lambs of God), Brazil and Mexico. This was offset by the_ timing of delivery of productions in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and in particular, India, where the regional _Big Brother versions started later, as well as lower revenues in the United Kingdom (due to Big Brother not_ returning in 2019) and north and western Europe (particularly Germany). Revenues from scripted programs decreased by €7.9 million, or 3.3%, from €236.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €228.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower revenues in France and phasing of distribution revenues in Endemol Shine International Limited. This decrease was partially offset by the delivery of the second season of Dark in Germany, the introduction of Deep Water, the return of Grantchester and Peaky Blinders and higher revenue from Tin Star in the United Kingdom and revenue growth in Australia (with the delivery of Lambs of God in the first quarter). Revenues from other genres decreased by €7.2 million, or 15.8%, from €45.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €38.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower activity of OP Talent in the United Kingdom and the reallocation of revenues from certain music and secondary rights from other genres to non-scripted revenue. _Revenues by Income Category_ The following table sets forth Endemol Shine’s revenues by income category for the periods presented. (a) Change in value and percent change are unaudited. Change in value represents the mathematical difference between the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, as set forth in the table above. Production revenues increased by €22.0 million, or 2.4%, from €904.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €926.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to revenue of €7.2 million generated from the scripted business (relating to, among others, the delivery of the second season of Dark in Germany) and a €13.7 million positive foreign exchange impact. The non-scripted production revenue remained stable, whereby the impact of Big Brother not being re-commissioned in the United Kingdom in 2019, lower revenues in France and the phasing of productions in Asia, Africa and the Middle East (the “Rest of the World”), were offset by increased revenues in the United States and Australia. Distribution and other revenues decreased by €18.2 million, or 12.2%, from €149.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €131.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of delivery of certain programs more skewed towards the fourth quarter of 2019. Other (Commercial) revenues decreased by €5.8 million, or 7.5%, from €77.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €71.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the finalization of certain digital inventory and brand licensing contracts more skewed towards the fourth quarter of 2019 and the recognition in 2018 of certain minimum guarantees on gaming and brand licensing contracts. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales decreased by €0.4 million from €868.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €867.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in revenues and change in product mix, as well as production efficiency improvements and the lower amortization of Endemol Shine’s capitalized format rights and program catalogue. 155 ----- _Gross Profit_ Gross profit decreased by €1.5 million, or 0.6%, from €263.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €261.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower contribution from the United Kingdom, France and distribution activities. This decrease was partly offset by higher profitability in the United States, and Iberia and lower amortization of intangible assets. _Indirect Cost of Sales and Overhead_ Indirect cost of sales and overhead decreased by €16.9 million, or 6.7%, from €251.1 million, or 22.2% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €234.2 million, or 20.7% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to cost savings in connection with restructuring plans in France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands as well as non-recurring transaction costs incurred in 2018 following the sales process of Endemol Shine and shareholder costs relating to legal fees and certain other shareholder expenses incurred in 2018. _Financial Income_ Financial income increased by €9.6 million, or 69.1%, from €13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €23.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the fair market value revaluation of cross currency swaps following the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. _Financial Expense_ Financial expense increased by €13.5 million, or 8.5%, from €158.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €171.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher interest expenses on Endemol Shine’s first and second lien debt due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the increase of the base LIBOR rate. _Share in Profit/(Loss) of Associates and Joint Ventures_ Share in profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures increased by €3.8 million from €3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to additional license fees received from Eredivisie Media & Marketing CV, which holds the Dutch soccer television rights. _Income Tax Benefit/(Expense)_ Income tax benefit decreased by €3.6 million, or 69.2%, from €5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to €1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the receipt of prepaid state taxes in the United States relating to prior years. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, Endemol Shine incurred higher taxes due to unrecognized tax losses and lower tax credits. _Profit/(Loss) for the Period_ Loss for the period decreased by €11.6 million, or 9.3%, from a loss of €124.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, to a loss of €112.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 156 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

This reclassification is unaudited and has no impact on operating results. The restated consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 presented in this offering memorandum includes a reclassification of €149.1 million between cost of sales and indirect cost of sales and overhead. This reclassification aims at fully presenting the impact of the functional allocation implemented for the first time in the Audited Endemol Shine Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Accordingly, decreases in cost items are shown as positive changes in the change in value column, and negative changes in the percentage change (%) column, and increases in cost items are shown as negative changes in the change in value column, and positive changes in the percentage change (%) column. _Revenue_ Revenue decreased by €68.1 million, or 3.7%, from €1,847.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €1,779.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to foreign exchange effects amounting to €47.1 million and the winding down of operations in Turkey (amounting to €8.3 million) and the disposal of Endemol Shine’s operations in South Africa (amounting to €7.4 million). The decrease in revenues was also due to a decrease in revenues in France with the termination of The Voice contract, non-recommissioning of The Wall and lower scripted revenues in Italy and Australia which was partly offset by an increase in revenues in the United States and the United Kingdom. The negative foreign exchange impact of €47.1 million was primarily a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar (amounting to €17.4 million), the Australian dollar (amounting to €7.9 million), the British pound (amounting to €5.4 million), the Russian rubble (amounting to €3.6 million), the Swedish krona (amounting to €3.8 million) and the Indian rupee (amounting to €3.2 million). 157 ----- _Revenues by Genre_ The following table sets forth Endemol Shine’s revenues by genre for the periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The United Kingdom also showed higher volumes for All Together Now and Pointless offsetting_ France’s loss of The Voice and non-commissioning of The Wall in 2018. Revenues from scripted programs decreased by €54.1 million, or 10.7%, from €506.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €452.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to negative foreign exchange impact amounting to €10.4 million and a number of shows not returning in Australia (Offspring, Sisters and Wake in Freight), Italy (La Profia and Le Tre Rose di Eva) and the Nordic Countries (Bron), as well as lower production volume in the Rest of the World (with the termination of Endemol Shine’s activities in Turkey in 2017). This was only partially offset by increased production revenues in the United Kingdom and the U.S. with the delivery of key programs including Curfew, Troy, Black Mirror, Humans and Utopia. Revenues from other genres increased by €1.3 million, or 2.1%, from €61.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €62.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to additional activities of OP Talent in the UK. _Revenues by income category_ The following table sets forth Endemol Shine’s revenues by income category for the periods presented. (a) Change in value and percent change are unaudited. Change in value represents the mathematical difference between the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, as set forth in the table above. Production revenues decreased by €53.4 million, or 3.6%, from €1,487.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €1,434.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a negative foreign exchange rate impact amounting to €41.8 million and lower scripted revenues and lower non-scripted revenues in France in 2018. Distribution revenues decreased by €13.9 million, or 5.6%, from €246.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €232.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower distribution revenues from 24 Hours and no profit share for the Steve Harvey Show, which ended in 2017. 158 ----- Other (Commercial) revenues remained stable at €112.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from €112.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales decreased by €77.4 million, or 5.4%, from €1,432.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €1,355.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower revenues in 2018 reflective of the largely variable nature of Endemol Shine’s cost of sales combined with production efficiency improvements and better cost utilization across all segments and the lower amortization of Endemol Shine’s capitalized format rights and program catalogue. _Gross Profit_ Gross profit increased by €9.3 million, or 2.2%, from €414.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €424.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to lower amortization of intangible assets (€13.2 million) in 2018. _Indirect Cost of Sales and Overhead_ Indirect cost of sales and overhead decreased by €17.5 million, or 4.4%, from €400.1 million, or 21.7% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €382.6 million, or 21.5% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to cost savings in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, the United Kingdom and other European countries, as well as savings following the termination of production activities in favor of format sales in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, partly offset by the impairment losses on goodwill in France (amounting to €44.1 million) due to the loss of formats and non-commissioning of scripted titles combined with the ongoing challenging and competitive market in France, non-recurring transaction related costs following the sales process of the Endemol Shine and shareholder costs relating to legal fees and certain other shareholder expenses incurred, in each case, in 2018. _Financial Income_ Financial income decreased by €79.7 million, or 73.9%, from €107.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €28.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro in 2018 resulting in foreign exchange loss of €43.3 million, compared to a profit of €103.9 million in 2017. This decrease was partly offset by the positive fair market value revaluation of the cross currency swap following the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. _Financial Expense_ Financial expense increased by €17.5 million, or 8.6%, from €204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €222.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to interest costs related to Endemol Shine’s first and second lien term loans and foreign currency exchange losses following the revaluation of the GBP and USD portion of Endemol Shine’s external loans. This was partly offset by the positive adjustment to the fair market value of the cross currency swap following the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In 2017, the revaluation of the cross currency swap led to a loss of €42.0 million, while in 2018 the revaluation led to a profit of €16.5 million. _Share in Profit/(Loss) of Associates and Joint Ventures_ Share in profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures increased by €3.8 million, from €2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the exclusion of the Reshet losses in 2018 following the full impairment of the investment in 2017 and better results of Endemol Shine’s investment in Eredivisie Media & Marketing CV, which holds the Dutch soccer television rights. _Income Tax Benefit/(Expense)_ Income tax benefit/(expense) decreased by €9.6 million, from an expense of €8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to a benefit of €0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was 159 ----- primarily due to an increase of the losses before tax in 2018, an adjustment to the total tax that affected the number of non-valued tax losses and credits, a decrease of the non-deductible expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 and the country mix where Endemol Shine realizes taxable profits leading to a lower tax expense and an increase of benefits of tax losses recognized. _Profit/(Loss) for the Period_ Loss for the period increased by €57.0 million, or 64.6%, from a loss of €88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to a loss of €145.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the negative foreign exchange impact following the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the impairment loss on goodwill relating to cash generating unit France (€44.1 million), non-recurring transaction related costs and a true up of shareholder costs in 2018. This decrease was partly offset by the increase in gross profit.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

This reclassification is unaudited and has no impact on operating results. The restated consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 presented in this offering memorandum includes a reclassification of €149.1 million between cost of sales and indirect cost of sales and overhead. This reclassification aims at fully presenting the impact of the functional allocation implemented for the first time in the Audited Endemol Shine Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. See “Presentation of Financial and Other _Information—Endemol Shine Financial Statements.”_ (2) Change in value and percentage change are unaudited and represent the absolute difference and percentage difference, respectively, between the results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, based on the appropriate mathematical formula. Accordingly, decreases in cost items are shown as positive changes in the change in value column, and negative changes in the percentage change (%) column, and increases in cost items are shown as negative changes in the change in value column, and positive changes in the percentage change (%) column. _Revenue_ Revenue decreased by €44.5 million, or 2.4%, from €1,892.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €1,847.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to foreign exchange effects amounting to €42.3 million and €40.0 million of non-organic negative impact following divestitures in Denmark (amounting to €4.9 million), Norway (amounting to €0.4 million), Turkey (amounting to €18.0 million), Argentina (amounting to €9.1 million), Chile (amounting to €3.0 million) and the Middle East (amounting to €4.2 million), as well as the restructuring of operations in South East Asia in 2017. The decrease was partly offset by the strong performance of Endemol Shine’s programs such as Broadchurch, The Bridge and _Tin Star, reflecting a €34.5 million growth in the distribution business, excluding the impact of foreign exchange_ rates, and a €25.6 million growth in revenue in Iberia, driven by additional volume on both scripted (La Catedral 160 ----- _del Mar) and non-scripted (Your Face Sounds Familiar, Operación Triunfo and MasterChef) programs. The_ negative foreign exchange impact of €42.3 million was primarily due to the weakening of the British pound (amounting to €34.5 million) and the U.S. dollar (amounting to €6.3 million). _Revenues by Genre_ The following table sets forth Endemol Shine’s revenues by genre for the periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Change in value represents the mathematical difference between the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, as set forth in the table above. Revenues from non-scripted programs decreased by €24.8 million, or 1.9%, from €1,304.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €1,279.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to negative foreign exchange impact of €18.9 million in 2017 and lower revenues from Big Brother and The Steve Harvey Show in the United States, the cancellation of The Voice in Australia and non-commissioning of The Money Drop in France and the impact of the divested operations in Argentina, Chile and the Middle East, partly offset by the re-introduction of Fear Factor in the US and new shows like Hunted (the United States) and The Wall (Germany, France and Spain). Revenues from scripted programs decreased by €14.1 million, or 2.7%, from €520.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €506.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to negative foreign exchange impact amounting to €22.6 million in 2017 and lower production volumes in the United Kingdom due to non-returning formats (Humans, Guerilla) and in Turkey and Italy (with Sacrificio _D’Amore not returning). This decrease was partly offset by strong distribution performance (Humans, Tin Star)_ and UK and Iberia new commissions (Broadchurch, Tin Star and La Catedral del Mar). Revenues from other genres decreased by €5.6 million, or 8.4%, from €66.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €61.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by a 2016 one-off Mariah Carey event in the United States. _Revenues by Income Category_ The following table sets forth Endemol Shine’s revenues by income category for the periods presented. (a) Change in value and percent change are unaudited. Change in value represents the mathematical difference between the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, as set forth in the table above. Production revenues decreased by €59.9 million, or 3.9%, from €1,547.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to €1,487.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the negative foreign exchange impact amounting to €27.5 million in 2017 and lower scripted volumes following non-commissioning of The Money Drop in France, The Voice in Australia and Gran Hermano and The _Biggest Loser in the United States combined with various other scripted titles not being produced in 2017._ 161 ----- Distribution revenues increased by €21.7 million, or 9.6%, from €225.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to €246.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to increased distribution revenues from scripted titles, predominantly coming from Humans 2, Broadchurch 2, Tin _Star and The Frankenstein Chronicles._ Other (Commercial) revenues decreased by €6.3 million, or 5.3%, from €119.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to €112.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to negative foreign exchange effects. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales decreased by €75.5 million, or 5.0%, from €1,508.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €1,432.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes, production efficiency improvements, better cost utilization across all segments, different product mix (higher contribution of distribution business, with relatively high margin) and the degressive amortization of Endemol Shine’s capitalized format rights and finished program catalogue. The value for the format rights and finished program catalogue originates from the purchase price allocation in 2014. _Gross Profit_ Gross profit increased by €31.0 million, or 8.1%, from €383.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €414.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to different product mix (higher contribution of distribution business, with relatively high margin) and the degressive amortization expense. _Indirect Cost of Sales and Overhead_ Indirect cost of sales and overhead decreased by €115.4 million, or 22.4%, from €515.5 million, or 27.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €400.1 million, or 21.7% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the impairment loss on goodwill in 2016 amounting to €114.0 million relating to the US (€75.4 million), Rest of the World (€16.6 million), relating to the exited countries and regions of Argentina, Chile, the Middle East, Kenya and South Africa, and an impairment on investments in associates and joint ventures in Brazil and Israel (€21.9 million). The impairment for 2017 amounted to (€23.8 million) relating to France (€18.6 million), Turkey (€5.2 million) and the investment in Reshet Media Ltd. (€5.9 million). This decrease in indirect cost of sales and overhead was further strengthened by cost saving plans materializing in the Americas, France and other European entities as well as savings following the sale of the studios in Denmark and Norway. _Financial Income_ Financial income increased by €90.4 million, from €17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €107.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar (against the Euro) in 2017 leading to a foreign exchange income of €103.9 million for Endemol Shine, while in 2016 Endemol Shine incurred a loss of €53.0 million. The positive foreign exchange impact in 2017 of €103.9 million was partly offset by the negative fair market value revaluation of €42.0 million of the cross currency swap following the weakening of the U.S. dollar. _Financial Expense_ Financial expense decreased by €17.4 million, or 7.8%, from €221.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to foreign currency exchange profits in 2017 following the appreciation of the U.S. dollar portion of Endemol Shine’s external loans (2016 Endemol Shine incurred a loss). This was partly offset by the negative adjustment to the fair market value of the cross currency swap following the weakening of the U.S. dollar (in 2017 the revaluation of the cross currency swap lead to a loss of €42.0 million, while in 2016 the revaluation lead to a profit of €8.7 million). _Share in Profit/(Loss) of Associates and Joint Ventures_ Share in profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures decreased by €0.7 million, or 20.6%, from €3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was 162 ----- primarily due to increased losses in 2017 of Endemol Shine’s investment in Reshet Media Ltd., partly offset by better results of Endemol Shine’s investment in Eredivisie Media & Marketing CV, which holds the Dutch soccer television rights. _Income Tax Benefit/(Expense)_ Income tax expense decreased by €10.2 million, or 53.7%, from €19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the tax effect of non-deductible expenses amounting to €45.7 million in 2016 (mainly the fair value adjustment to goodwill) and the tax on unrecognized tax losses. _Profit/(Loss) for the Period_ Loss for the period decreased by €26.2 million, or 22.9%, from a loss of €114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to a loss of €88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the higher impairment loss on goodwill in 2016 and cost efficiencies realized in 2017, which were fully offset by the negative foreign exchange impact following the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Because non-scripted programs are mainly produced in less than a year, working capital requirements related to Endemol Shine’s non-scripted business is mainly impacted by fluctuations in the number of non-scripted programs Endemol Shine produces. Endemol Shine may record cut-off impacts related to non-scripted activity at the end of each year if some large-scale programs are still under production. On the other hand, scripted productions have longer production cycles, and higher working capital requirements. Endemol Shine’s working capital related to scripted activity can be impacted significantly by cut-off issues at the end of the year. In addition, Endemol Shine sometimes finances a part of Endemol Shine’s scripted programs through tax credits or subsidies paid after the delivery of the program, which has an impact on Endemol Shine’s working capital for the year during which Endemol Shine produce the program but have not yet delivered it. Endemol Shine through Endemol Shine International Limited sometimes provides distribution advances for its production companies to secure deficit funding for these companies. The outstanding amount of these distribution advances is, on average, approximately €100 million, the majority of which represents advances paid to third-party owners for distribution rights. Net working capital improved over the years due to stricter collection efforts and the introduction of production financing through bilateral loans and the Borrowing Base Facility, which was entered into in 2016. Taxes receivable movements are mainly driven by timing of the receipt of production related tax credits and tax incentives. Receipt of these credits and incentives is subject to external tax audit finalization. Endemol Shine manages its production portfolio on a production-by-production basis, with detailed production budgets and monthly actual performance reviews. Every country has its own Production Working capital dynamics following local market and funding patterns. Endemol Shine’s working capital requirement for manageable working capital (excluding external production funding) ranges from 8% to 11% as a percentage of total revenue from the last twelve months. Under the Endemol Shine production cycle, Endemol Shine has a higher utilization of working capital and inventory in the first half of the year, which is mitigated with production funding. Endemol Shine’s revenues are typically largely concentrated in the second half of the year, mainly in the fourth quarter.

Changes in Endemol Shine’s interest in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. _Loss of Control_ When Endemol Shine loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. The resulting foreign currency differences are recognized in profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. _Foreign Operations_ The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. Income and expenses of foreign 168 ----- operations are translated into euro at exchange rates prevailing at transaction date. The resulting foreign currency differences are recognized in the translation reserve as part of equity, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to non-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of and control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is recycled to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If Endemol Shine disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to non-controlling interests.

Endemol Shine uses market observable data (to the extent practically possible) when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability. Fair values are categorized into different fair value hierarchy levels based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. Endemol Shine recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of net assets acquired and represents the future economic benefits that arise from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognized. Any gain on a bargain purchase (negative goodwill) is recognized in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities. Goodwill on acquisition of associates/joint ventures is included in investments in associates/joint ventures. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognized in profit or loss. Adjustments to the fair value of the consideration transferred and the provisional fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities in a business combination, identified within twelve months of the date of acquisition, are recognized retrospectively, provided that the new information relates to conditions that existed at the date of acquisition. In case the consideration transferred consists of (an) initial cash payment(s) and estimated future earn-out obligation based on (or related to) estimates of future results, any such obligations are only recognized as consideration if payments are not depending on future employment of the seller. An adjustment in the earn-out obligation recognized as consideration is accounted for in profit or loss. As part of a business combination, Endemol Shine can grant an option to non-controlling interests (for example, a minority shareholder), to sell to Endemol Shine (part of) their remaining interest in the business 169 ----- acquired. If such a put option provides for settlement in cash, any such obligations are only recognized as consideration if payments are not dependent on future employment of the seller. Endemol Shine treats such a transaction as if the put option has been exercised at acquisition date (the so-called ‘anticipated-acquisition method’) when analysis confirms all significant risks and rewards of the non-controlling interest have been transferred to Endemol Shine. Accordingly, no non-controlling interest is recognized. An adjustment in the put option liability recognized as consideration is accounted for in profit or loss. When a business combination is achieved in stages, the carrying value of the previously held equity interest is re- measured to fair value at acquisition date and the difference is recognized in profit or loss. If share-based payment awards (for example, replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to pre-combination service.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate components of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to Endemol Shine and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized whenever Endemol Shine disposes of it, or when no more future benefits are expected by its use. Gain or loss from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is calculated as the difference between the net amount of the disposal and the book value of the asset.

Goodwill recognized by Endemol Shine has arisen as a result of business combinations and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Note 2.10 of Audited Endemol Shine Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, sets out the recognition and measurement principles for impairment. _Other Intangible Assets_ Other intangible assets are those assets which are identifiable and can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights and primarily consist of format rights, movie and TV movie rights, contracts with customers and brand names. These assets can either be purchased, acquired in a business combination or internally developed if certain criteria for capitalization are met. Purchased other intangible assets are stated at cost, which is the purchase price, less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Note 2.10 of Audited Endemol Shine Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 sets out the recognition and measurement principles for impairment. Amortization occurs over the period Endemol Shine is expected to benefit from the use of the intangible asset and commences when the assets are available for use. 170 ----- Format rights are amortized as from the time the format is taken into production and in proportion to the number of programs produced. TV movie rights are amortized using a declining balance method based on the expected consumption of economic benefits from these assets. Development expenditures on individual projects are only recognized as an intangible asset when the following can be demonstrated: - it is technically feasible to complete the project so that it will be available for either use or sale; - there is an intention to complete the project; - the completed project is able to be either used or sold; - the manner(s) in which the asset is expected to generate future economic benefits; - resources are available to complete the project; and - development expenditures can be measured reliably. The amount initially recognized for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria. Where no internallygenerated intangible asset can be recognized, development expenditure is recognized in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred. Amortization of development expenditure starts when the project is available for use.

Joint control exists when decisions relating to the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognized initially at cost, which includes transaction costs.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.

Short-term employee benefits are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. Endemol Shine recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and other current employee benefits on an accrual basis. Furthermore, a provision is recognized where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. _Goodwill and Other Non-Current Intangible Assets with Infinite Lives_ Goodwill and other intangible assets with infinite lives are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication for impairment. Endemol Shine performed and completed annual impairment tests in the last quarter of the financial year. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost of disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement and allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent years. Except for goodwill, Endemol Shine assesses in subsequent years whether indications exist that impairment losses previously recognized for non-current assets may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of that asset (or cash generating unit) is recalculated and its carrying amount is increased to the revised recoverable amount. The increase is recognized in the income statement. A reversal is recognized only if it arises from a change in the assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. _Other Non-Current Assets with Finite Lives_ Other non-current assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated using an approach similar to that applied for non-current assets with infinite lives. For an asset that does not generate independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if and to the extent there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.

Where contingent consideration payable in the future is employment linked, it is treated as an employee benefit expense in the income statement over the period of required employment. The liability is stated at the net present value of the accrued part of the future obligation.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where Endemol Shine is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which Endemol Shine expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and Endemol Shine intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 176 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Endemol Shine classifies and subsequently measures financial assets at either amortized cost or FVTPL. Financial assets measured at amortized cost include trade receivables, other financial receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Derivative such as purchased options, swaps and forward contracts are measured subsequently at FVTPL. There are no financial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive income. Since January 1, 2018, Endemol Shine has applied the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and uninvoiced revenue (as defined in Note 2 to the Audited Endemol Shine Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018). For trade receivables or uninvoiced revenue that do not contain a significant financing component, the loss allowance should be measured at initial recognition and throughout its life at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss. Endemol Shine uses a provision matrix which is based on the historical credit loss experience over the life of the trade receivables. Endemol Shine subsequently measures financial liabilities at amortized cost, unless they are required to be measured at FVTPL. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include trade payables, other financial payables, cash and cash equivalents and loans and borrowings. Liabilities required to be measured at FVTPL include derivatives (such as foreign currency forwards or interest swaps), earn-out obligations and put-option liabilities. The amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is defined as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance. Financial assets are derecognized when, and only when, the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expires or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer has qualified for derecognition.

Valued at approximately €386 billion in 2018, the global television industry is projected to continue growing at a CAGR of approximately 1.9% from 2019 to 2023, reaching a value of approximately €419 billion, which is slightly slower growth as compared with a CAGR of approximately 2.2% between 2014 and 2018. The television industry’s key revenue streams, pay TV subscriptions (approximately 45% of value in 2018) and advertising (approximately 36% of value in 2018), are both expected to continue growing from 2019 to 2023, albeit more slowly than in recent years in the case of subscriptions and license fees due in large part to increasing SVOD use. License fees (approximately 7% of value in 2018) are expected to remain stable with a growth at a CAGR of less than 1% from 2019 to 2023, which is somewhat slower growth as compared with the growth in license fees of approximately 1% in the period between 2014 and 2018.

458_2,Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview,18.1.2,,"We operate in the global television and digital content industry, which has traditionally had a value chain made up of five component groups: producers, distributors, broadcasters, channels and platforms, each of which traditionally committed to addressing a single vertical within the market. The production and distribution components have largely consolidated, with many broadcasters (such as BBC Worldwide), major studios (such as Disney, Warner Brothers and NBC Universal) and scaled studios (including independents) (such as Banijay) having both production and distribution in-house. There remain a large number of independent producers who tend to operate on a somewhat smaller scale and usually do not have distribution capabilities. Next in the value chain are broadcasters/channels, which may be public service broadcasters (such as PBS in the United States, France Télévisions in France, ARD in Germany, ABC in Australia and the BBC in the United Kingdom), commercial channels (such as ABC in the United States, ProSieben in Germany and TF1 in France), thematic pay TV channels (such as Canal Plus Group in France and HGTV in the United States) or premium pay TV channels (such as Sky in the United Kingdom, Canal Plus in France, Movistar in Spain and HBO in the United States). Platforms are also an important part of the global television value chain and may be cable (such as Virgin Media), satellite (such as Sky or DIRECTV), internet protocol television “IPTV” (such as BT), digital terrestrial television “DTT” (such as Freeview) or VOD. VOD platforms, which are recent market entrants and are driving change in our industry, may be AVOD (such as YouTube), subscription-funded “SVOD” (such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and Hulu) or transactional “TVOD” (such as iTunes Store and Google Play). Television viewing generally has two axes: traditional “linear” viewing, ordinarily on a TV set, and OTT viewing on a TV set, computer or mobile device (including VOD viewing), with some platforms, such as the BBC, offering both linear and VOD viewing options. In addition, a number of newer SVOD options have recently, or are expected to, come online, including Apple TV+ (offering exclusive television show and movies and launched in November 2019), Disney+ (aggregating content from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Lucasfilm and Fox and launched in November 2019), HBO Max (offering original content from Warner Brothers, HBO and the CW and expected to launch in the first half of 2020) and Peacock (a streaming service from NBC Universal offering original programming, catalogue titles and reboots and expected to launch in April 2020). Over its almost 70-year history, the global television industry has grown consistently and is currently in a period of significant transition and development. At its advent, television was a relatively restricted local industry, with two to four broadcasters in most countries, public service broadcasters dominating and highly regulated commercial networks. From the late 1970s, the industry entered a period of liberalization in which pay TV channels emerged and expanded in an environment of regulatory relaxation and economies that boosted demand for advertising. In the late 1980s, satellite and cable offerings drove multi-channel offers in many markets, while premium sports and movie programming also expanded. Beginning around 2000, the “content revolution” saw formatted non-scripted content spread across the globe and become international brands, which was boosted by technological improvements such as digital television and broadband acceleration. The present period is characterized by another set of technological improvements and consumption shifts, with the rapid expansion of OTT viewing as well as internet-based television content aimed at the global market, the growth of the Asian and Latin American television markets and a shift in power along the value chain in favor of content and direct-to-consumer offerings. 178 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

In 2018, network television accounted for approximately €124 billion in revenues, thematic channels accounted for approximately €81 billion in revenues, premium services accounted for approximately €55 billion in revenues and SVOD accounted for approximately €26 billion in revenues. As regards revenue sources, network television is largely advertising-funded (approximately 71% of revenues in 2018) and is thus reliant on revenues that are highly sensitive to macroeconomic trends, as compared with premium services and SVOD, which rely on subscriptions (approximately 89% and 100%, respectively, of revenues in 2018). Premium service revenues are highly exposed to the “cord cutting” trend (whereby viewers abandon expensive pay and premium services in favor of less expensive OTT options) in the U.S., although subscription revenues have increased in other geographies. SVOD has proven to be an attractive complement and alternative to traditional pay TV models, particularly among younger populations. SVOD also has a potent ability to impact the wider market. For example, their comparatively high spending on original content is forcing other players to increase content spend, as further discussed below. Thematic channels, which are packaged by platforms as part of a basic pay TV offer, have the most diversified and balanced revenue mix, with advertising and carriage fees (fees paid by platforms to broadcasters to carry their channels) composing the majority of revenues, but their exposure to advertising revenues still remains high and the specialized nature of their content can make them less attractive to advertisers. As regards geographic revenue trends, the North American television market is characterized by higher advertising spend per capita and higher pay TV penetration as compared with the Rest of the World, while the two dominant European markets, Germany and the United Kingdom, are supported by comparatively high pay TV spend, as well as advertising and license fees. The graph below shows content spend in Western Europe, which has remained stable throughout the economic downturns, notably between 2007 and 2009 where total content spend, excluding sports rights content, grew 0.3% while aggregate television advertising revenues dropped by 14.2%. 35 30 25 20 15 10",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Programs and formats may be either “non-scripted,” such as reality shows, entertainment shows, game shows or talk shows, or “scripted,” such as comedies or dramas that follow a written story and plot line. Content may either be produced by the producer who created the program/format or by a third party that acquires the rights to produce the content through a license agreement for a specific program/format and a specific geography. Content has traditionally been developed to cater to the viewer preferences of specific geographic markets but is increasingly being developed for wider audiences on a global scale, driven by the content offer of global VOD services. _Commissioning and sale of new content: Once a program/format has been developed, it is pitched to_ broadcasters and/or digital platforms. A pitch generally includes a detailed description of the program/format or, in certain instances, a full “pilot” is prepared by the production company, either at its own expense or with the financial support from the broadcaster or digital platform. The sales process for a format also generally includes the preparation of detailed production schedules and budgets for the broadcaster or digital platform to consider when deciding whether or not to commission a program/format. A program or format may either be originated (for example, a new program or format is commissioned by a broadcaster or digital platform), or it may be acquired (for example, the rights to an existing format are licensed for local adaptation by a broadcaster or digital platform). _Production and airing of new content: Once a broadcaster or digital platform has confirmed the_ commissioning or purchase of a program/format, the production process begins and programs based on the format are put into production. Production processes vary significantly depending on the type of format/program, but generally involve pre-filming preparatory work, filming, content editing and preparation of the program for 181 ----- delivery to the broadcaster or digital platform.

458_2,Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Financial Crisis (2-yr change),18.3.2,The Global Content Distribution Industry,"Content distributors control the rights to the content developed as described above. Distributors enter into license agreements with licensees (mainly broadcasters and digital platforms), whereby such licensees may exercise certain rights to a given format/program, including the right to produce and/or air a format/program for a certain period of time and for a predetermined number of runs in a specific territory. Distribution of content allows production companies to increase their profits because costs associated with managing and selling a content library are relatively low, as compared to production costs. As a result, our industry has witnessed significant consolidation of production and distribution functions in recent years. Certain producers have pursued a vertically-integrated strategy, owning their own distribution business, as we do with our distribution companies. However, not all producers have their own distribution business and, as such, will grant licenses to distribution companies to distribute their formats/programs on their behalf, in exchange for a distribution commission. Historically, large international production groups such as Fremantle have been focused on maintaining exclusive intellectual property rights to their content catalogues within the territories in which they operate: this business model generates additional production value and distribution revenues from format fees paid by broadcasters. The royalties generated by the distribution business (the fees distributors receive from their licensees after deducting their commission) constitute important secondary revenues for the owners of the intellectual property rights to the format or program. As part of the commissioning and sale process, the broadcaster or digital platform may try to obtain ownership of the intellectual property rights to the program and/or the format itself. The owner of the intellectual property rights will generally control the future use of the program and/or format across jurisdictions and will, as a result, benefit from additional revenues generated, for example by exporting the format to additional markets and worldwide program sales. Depending on the market, broadcasters may retain all or part of such rights in the program and/or format. Otherwise, production companies, including the Combined Group, retain full intellectual property rights to the format and program. The ability to capitalize on formats or programs in forms other than the initial licensing to broadcasters and digital platforms varies from one format or program to another. The additional rights received by a producer from the content it has produced are known as “secondary rights.” In some cases, the producer has no secondary rights, and in other cases, it may only have the right to distribute the content in certain media and territories for a limited term, depending on the ownership of the format and the agreement with the relevant broadcaster or digital platform. Additional rights, or “ancillary rights,” related to a format or program may also be granted to licensees, such as for merchandising, music rights, DVD sales, digital services and mobile applications. These ancillary rights can drive further revenues.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Financial Crisis (2-yr change),18.3.3,Key Market Drivers,"Companies that are in the television and digital content production and distribution industry have historically operated a B2B business model, with broadcasters, channels and platforms as their primary customers. As a result, the dynamics affecting the production and distribution markets were for a long time closely tied to those that impacted the wider broadcasting and television industry. However, due to the emergence of new content buyers (such as VOD platforms) and even some vertically-integrated direct-to-consumer offerings (such as Netflix), this traditional approach is changing. Traditional industry players are increasing their investments in original content (both scripted and non-scripted) largely driven by the entry of new OTT players such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, among others, which place independent content developers, producers and distributors such as the Combined Group in a favorable position. The key forces that are currently driving the global television and digital content industry are technological shifts caused by the rise of OTT services, shifting consumer behavior favoring increased content spend and competition-driven consolidation. _Tailwinds in OTT Viewership and Global Proliferation of Content_ The key technological force that is driving our market today is the rise of OTT services, on the back of the “broadband revolution” of the early 2000s. While OTT platforms currently represent a relatively small portion of the market, their rise is likely to be one of the greatest disruptive forces challenging traditional industry players in the years to come. 182 ----- The reach of OTT technology is significant and growing. By the end of 2018, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and Hulu collectively accounted for almost half of the combined content spend of the ten largest global networks/ platforms. Netflix has approximately 158 million subscribers worldwide, while Amazon had over 100 million subscribers to its “Prime” service, which includes its streaming video offering. Another useful measure of the rise of OTT is the number of SVOD subscriptions per household. The number of SVOD subscriptions per household varies across geographies, but is generally on the rise. The number of SVOD subscriptions per household is currently highest in the United States (with an average of 1.4 SVOD subscriptions per household), where “cord cutting” is also most prevalent, due in large part to consumer willingness to replace expensive pay TV services with one or more relatively less expensive OTT offerings. Denmark trails the United States in terms of average SVOD subscriptions per household (0.8), followed by Sweden (0.6), the United Kingdom (0.6) and Australia (0.5). Even where the number of SVOD subscriptions per household is already relatively high, there may be room for further growth, as it is relatively common for users to subscribe to more than one SVOD provider. Multiple SVOD subscriptions are expected to become more common as niche services with lower price points become more common. On the other end of the spectrum are other European countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, where the average SVOD subscription per household is at or below 0.4, which may also represent a growth opportunity. Lower penetration of SVOD is primarily the result of slower broadband speed, lack of local content and late market entry of local players.

Both Amazon Prime Video and Netflix are increasing their budgets and demand for content significantly. Excluding spending on sports content, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video spent the highest amounts (approximately €10.2 billion and €5.3 billion, respectively) on content in 2018, representing an increase from 2017 (approximately €7.6 billion and €5.0 billion, respectively). This increased spending was made up of both commissions and acquisitions. Among VOD platforms, Netflix delivers the most original shows and has increased the overall demand for content. Netflix has added approximately 1,000 original titles, including commissions, to its catalogue since 2012 and spent approximately 85% of its total programming budget on originations in 2018. Other traditional players have recently launched or are expected to launch OTT platforms, such as Britbox (ITV/BBC), RTL Group, Pro7, Salto (TF1/France Télévisions / Groupe M6), Mediaset Espana, Disney+, Peacock (NBC Universal), Apple+, Warner and HBO Max. In addition to their increasing consumer base, OTT have an outsized influence on the content market, as trends that first manifest at the OTT-level, such as binge-watching of boxed set content, tend to migrate to traditional platforms. For example, networks now look for global reach with brands such as Planet Earth. 183 ----- _Shifting Consumer Behavior Favoring Increased Content Spend_ The rise of OTT services described above is driving changes to consumer behavior, first in regards to viewing patterns and second in regards to demand for content. Viewing patterns show shift toward on demand viewing Generally, while “linear” viewing on a television set remains the most common form of viewing, global viewing habits are moving towards more on demand viewing. On demand viewing may take many forms, from time-shifted viewing on traditional broadcast television channels to the various online and/or streaming VOD options. The graphics below show this shift away from linear viewing in the United States between 2011 and 2016 and the United Kingdom between 2012 and 2018 in terms of daily viewing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Our largest geographic markets for television and digital content production include France, the Nordic Countries, the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom. While we expect that most of our key markets will generally continue to expand in the near future, growth will likely be slower than in previous years. Although macroeconomic conditions in our key markets are expected to continue to generally support accelerated GDP growth, the television industry is generally highly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, particularly in sectors that rely on advertising revenues. Further, while the rise of OTT may challenge traditional broadcasters, channels and platforms, we believe their growth represents an opportunity for content producers, especially for players like the Combined Group, because they drive content demand and represent a growing segment of content consumers. Each of our key markets requires a tailored approach to produce and distribute content successfully. In particular, the balance between traditional platforms and emerging OTT services vary in popularity and penetration across our key markets. _France_ Television revenues in France remained broadly flat in recent years, shrinking slightly from approximately €9.0 billion in 2016 to approximately €8.7 billion in 2018. Revenues are fairly evenly spread between license fees, advertising and subscriptions. Content spend as a proportion of revenues in France has also been relatively stable, at approximately 70% in 2016 and approximately 74% in 2018, of which more than half were acquisitions, approximately 25% were external commissions and approximately 14% were in-house commissions in 2018. In 2018, the main pay TV player in the French market was SFR (since its merger with Numericable), followed by Canal Plus and Orange, while TF1 is the main broadcaster, followed by France Télévisions and M6. SVOD penetration is increasing in France, from approximately 4% in 2016 to approximately 12% in 2018 and projected growth to approximately 17% by 2020. Independent producers outnumber in-house broadcast production companies and are very active in the television production sector. The high number of independent producers in France is due in part to the fact that French law requires broadcasters to dedicate a certain percentage of their revenues to commissioning independent audiovisual works. The largest players in the French independent production sector, other than the Combined Group, are Fremantle, Lagardère Studios and Newen. _Nordic Countries (Denmark and Sweden)_ Television revenues in Denmark and Sweden remained relatively stable from approximately €1.8 billion in Denmark and €2.2 billion in Sweden in 2016 to €1.7 billion in Denmark and €2.2 billion in Sweden in 2018. Revenues in Denmark and Sweden are fairly evenly spread between license fees, advertising and subscriptions, with subscriptions representing the largest source of revenues. Content spend as a proportion of revenues in Denmark and Sweden has also been relatively stable, at approximately 55% in Denmark and approximately 49% in Sweden over the 2016 to 2018 period. The main pay TV players in Denmark are TDC and Boxer Denmark and in Sweden were Tele 2 and Canal Digital, while DR and TV 2 are the main broadcasters in Denmark and SVT, TV4 and NENT Group are the main broadcasters in Sweden. SVOD penetration is high and increasing in Denmark and Sweden, from approximately 37% and 35% respectively in 2016, to approximately 58% and 52% respectively in 2018 and projected growth to approximately 70% and 65%, respectively, in 2020. The major independent production players in Denmark, other than Banijay and Endemol Shine, are Fremantle, NICE Entertainment, Red Arrow Studios and Warner Brothers. The Swedish independent production industry is dominated by local independent producer NICE Entertainment, who competes with international production houses like the Combined Group, Fremantle and ITV Studios. _United States_ The United States is an important geographic market in terms of both production and consumption. Television revenues have declined in recent years, shrinking slightly from approximately €125 billion in 2016 to approximately €115 billion in 2018. Revenues are heavily skewed towards subscriptions, which accounted for approximately 64% of revenues in 2018. Content spend as a proportion of revenues in the United States has increased in recent years, from approximately 38% in 2016 to approximately 41% in 2018, of which almost half were acquisitions, approximately 39% were external commissions and approximately 10% were in-house commissions in 2018. The primary commercial networks are CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox and the primary pay TV market was fragmented, with many platforms (such as Charter, Comcast and AT&T) offering similar packages. SVOD penetration is high and increasing in the United States, from approximately 36% in 2016, to approximately 56% in 2018 and projected growth to approximately 78% in 2020. The major U.S. studios (including Disney and Warner Brothers, as well as independent players MGM and Lionsgate) dominate the production sector, but the independent production sector remains fragmented. 186 ----- _Italy_ Television revenues in Italy decreased slightly in recent years, from approximately €8.4 billion in 2016 to €8.0 billion in 2018. Revenues are spread between license fees, advertising and subscriptions, of which advertising has the largest share (over 40% in 2018). Content spend as a proportion of revenues in Italy has increased slightly, from approximately 59% in 2016 to approximately 61% in 2018, of which approximately 58% were acquisitions, approximately 18% were external commissions and approximately 15% were in-house commissions in 2018. The broadcast market in Italy is fairly consolidated, with four networks (RAI, Mediaset, Discovery and La7) dominating the market. In 2018, the main pay TV players were Sky, Mediaset and Telecom Italia. SVOD penetration is increasing in Italy, from approximately 1% in 2016 to approximately 3% in 2018 and projected growth to approximately 6% by 2020. The production industry in Italy has had success in altering global formats for an Italian audience and is led by, other than the Combined Group, independent production players such as Fremantle and MGM. _United Kingdom_ The United Kingdom is a leading geographic market for the creation and launch of formats because broadcasters demonstrate a willingness to experiment with new ideas and the legal framework protects producers’ rights to their programs. Television revenues in the United Kingdom have fluctuated in recent years, from approximately €17.1 billion in 2016, to approximately €16.8 billion in 2017 and approximately €16.1 billion in 2018. Revenues are spread between license fees, advertising and subscriptions. Content spend as a proportion of revenues in the United Kingdom has been increasing, from approximately 50% in 2016 to approximately 52% in 2018, of which approximately 58% were acquisitions, approximately 21% were external commissions and approximately 15% were in-house commissions in 2018. Competition is high among network broadcasters, as the broadcast market is highly fragmented, with BBC1 holding the single largest viewing share (approximately 21%) in 2018, followed by ITV1, BBC2, Channel 4 and 5, and with all other channels accounting for more than 47% of the viewing market. In 2018, the main pay TV players were Sky, Virgin Media, BT and Talk Talk. SVOD penetration is increasing in the United Kingdom, from approximately 19% in 2016 to approximately 29% in 2018 and projected growth to approximately 37% by 2020. The production industry in the United Kingdom is highly competitive and was valued at over £3 billion in 2018. The key independent production players in the United Kingdom are Endemol, All3Media, Avalon TV, Carnival, Fremantle and Left Bank.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.6,"UK daily viewing, 2012-18",18.6.2,Competitive Landscape,"Competition in the television and digital content production and distribution sectors remains fragmented: in many markets, a number of small, independent groups are important market participants. We have observed in recent years a trend towards significant consolidation within our industry, particularly through vertical consolidation and business combinations of market participants with one another. We believe that this consolidation is driven, in part, by market players’ desire to expand their content portfolios, thereby allowing them to further develop their capacity to successfully distribute their formats and programs. For example, most leading production groups also have established distribution businesses. This branch of activity allows them to market and sell their content and formats internationally to broadcasters and digital platforms. We have been an active and successful player in the consolidation of our industry and Banijay has been the only significant producer and distributor with worldwide operations that has managed to remain independent, as the majority of large European production houses are now controlled by established broadcasting groups. The Combined Group is the largest independent content producer based on revenues and content production hours for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Combined Group competes with other integrated production and distribution groups such as ITV Studios, Fremantle and All3Media, as well as smaller independent production companies, such as Tinopolis. Certain competitors, such as ITV Studios, have experienced significant growth through M&A activity in recent years. This is a reflection of the overall consolidation trend in the industry. There are four key types of players in the global content production and distribution industry: major studios (such as Warner Brothers and Disney), in-house content divisions (such as ITV Studios and BBC Worldwide), scaled studios (including independents) (such as Banijay) and smaller independents (such as Hat Trick and Beta), with local players, although locally significant, having a comparatively small global role. _Major studios: major studios, most of which are based in the U.S., such as Warner Brothers and Disney,_ tend to produce high-quality and expensive scripted content. Although we do produce scripted content and intend 187 ----- to focus more resources on scripted content in the future, we do not typically directly compete with major studios for content production contracts. Major studios tend to have integrated production and distribution businesses. _In-house content divisions: certain broadcasters, such as BBC or ITV in the United Kingdom, maintain their_ own in-house production departments. Some players have large in-house departments, as opposed to outsourcing their content production to third parties. Companies with in-house production capacities are integrated, as both production and distribution is done in-house. _Scaled studios (including independents): scaled studios (including independents) are often established_ through business combination transactions whereby independent producers in various markets are combined into one international group. In order to succeed and maximize market share, these groups typically maintain a presence in the United Kingdom and the United States in light of these markets’ importance for the overall industry. Scaled studios (including independents) are free to experiment with different content formats and pursue various production avenues. They are well-known for producing non-scripted formats which are popular with broadcasters as they tend to be low-risk opportunities as their production costs are significantly lower than scripted content. Scaled studios (including independents), including Banijay, tend to have integrated production and distribution businesses. _Smaller independents: independent companies are generally groups whose activities are limited to a specific_ domestic or specialist market. In general, small independents focus on a particular niche area or may even specialize in a specific show format and are known for producing creative content and are often on the cutting edge of innovation. Smaller independent companies include Elephant & Cie and Coyote in France, Hat Trick and Avalon in the United Kingdom and Ballandi in Italy and 7 y Accion and Zebra TV in Spain. Smaller independents tend not to, but may, have integrated production and distribution businesses. The major players in the global content distribution industry are largely the same as in the global content production industry, following the consolidation of many key producers with distributors in recent years. 188 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Viewer preferences and platform strategies are driving increasing content spend As a result of this shift toward online and on demand viewing, content supply is expected to increasingly reflect the demands of OTT audiences, which are currently characterized by viewer appetite for high-budget scripted content and more globalized viewer tastes. Content spend is expected to continue increasing, due in part to increased investment by VOD players and traditional players seeking to compete with VOD players, new sources of revenue from online offerings and innovation in content forms. At present, viewer demand is largely focused on high-budget scripted content, which is driving polarization of spend and schedule allocation. Global annual commission spending grew at a CAGR of approximately 2% between 2012 and 2018, within which drama content was the fastest growth area (approximately 7%), followed by formatted non-scripted entertainment (approximately 3%), sports, children’s and current affairs content (approximately 2%) and factual entertainment (approximately 2%). On one hand, increased spending on drama content has been driven in part by a shift in consumer habits to binge-watching of boxed set content and competition among cable channels for subscription fees, with the largest volume gains in the United States. On the other hand, spending on formatted non-scripted entertainment, which increased markedly (above 10%) between 1998 and 2008, has slowed as schedules have filled with established programs and formats. However, demand for non-scripted content, in which the Combined Group has particular experience and strength, continues to be high. For example, audience preferences in the APAC market, which is expected to drive total content spend and growth in the size of the global TV market, are skewed towards non-scripted formats such as game shows, quiz shows, talent shows and reality competitions. Additionally, as a counter to increased spending on high-budget drama, some spending has shifted to more cost-effective formats, including non-scripted and factual entertainment programs such as “lifestyle shows,” another trend that may benefit the Combined Group in the years to come. Content spend as proportion of revenues varies across business models: in 2018, premium services invested approximately 75% of revenues in content (after platform margins) followed closely by SVOD (72%), as compared with 64% by network television and 43% by thematic channels. High content spend by SVOD players 184 ----- is expected to decline once SVOD reaches scale, as these players begin to see higher margins. Content spend has been relatively resilient during downturns. During the dot-com crash in the early 2000s content spend continued to rise, even as advertising revenues fell, and during the 2008 financial crisis, content spend remained stable in Western Europe, even as advertising revenues dropped precipitously. Content spend is projected to expand at a CAGR of approximately 4.7% between 2020 and 2025 (compared to a CAGR of approximately 6% between 2017 and 2020), with growth expected across all service provider types (network television, thematic channels, premium services and SVOD) through 2025, as shown by the graphic below.

Estimated content spend ratio is highest in Europe (60% of revenues in 2018, with 26% of revenues spent on commissions), as compared with 40% (with 18% of revenues spent on commissions) for North America and 45% (with 21% of revenues spent on commissions) for APAC. High spend on content in Europe is driven by the strength of public service broadcasters that tend to invest in local content and external producers. Within Europe in 2018, content spend as a proportion of revenues was highest in France and Spain, followed by Italy and Denmark. Content spend in North America, which has historically been comparatively lower than Europe and APAC, is expected to increase as major networks are pushed to invest more heavily in content to compete with VOD players as competition increases between VOD players. In addition, in most of the countries where the Combined Group operates, these content demand patterns tend to favor the growth of the independent sector in which the Combined Group operates. For example, in 2018, external productions accounted for over a third of all non-news commissions in the United Kingdom (58%), Germany (40%), France (64%), Italy (54%), Spain (64%), the Netherlands (38%), Sweden (73%) and Denmark (51%). _Consolidation Shifting the Dynamics Among Content Industry Players_ The global television and digital content production and distribution industries are in a period of consolidation, in which large integrated media companies are consolidating and undertaking M&A to strengthen their positions across the supply chain, scaled studios (including independents) like Banijay are acquiring smaller indies to maintain a fresh flow of intellectual property and platforms are acquiring channels and investing more in content production, as discussed above, as a result. Horizontal consolidation has led to the emergence of very large production groups and vertical consolidation has led to broadcasters and digital platforms increasingly owning their own content. VOD players, such as Netflix and Amazon, are also expanding their content businesses. We believe that this consolidation is driven, in part, by market players’ desire to expand their content portfolios, thereby allowing them to further develop their capacity to successfully distribute their formats and programs. For example, most leading production groups also have established distribution businesses. This branch of activity allows them to market and sell their content and formats internationally to broadcasters and digital platforms. The rise of OTT technology and shifting consumer behavior patterns described above have both increased competition in our industry, with the increasing popularity of OTT viewing putting pressure on traditional players and with evolving viewing habits creating room for different players to distinguish themselves from their competitors. Traditional linear broadcasters are expanding their reach in the VOD space to respond to the rise of the players such as Netflix and Amazon, both at a local/regional scale and a global scale, if their market position allows it. U.S. networks such as Disney, Warner Bros or NBC are currently taking back their content portfolios for their own global VOD offerings. For example, in August 2017, Disney announced its plans to end its distribution agreement with Netflix for subscription streaming of new releases in anticipation of its own Disney+ streaming service, and in June 2019, NBC Universal announced that it had secured the exclusive domestic streaming rights to The Office for its soon-to-be-launched streaming service, ending The Office’s successful run on Netflix. 185 |176|217|Col3| |---|---|---| |176 158 24 18 24 28 36 40 80 82|37|| ||35 53|| ||89|| -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

We develop a wide variety of formats in order to limit our exposure to blockbusters and to keep a diversified portfolio of formats. We classify our formats in two main genres: non-scripted and scripted. Non-scripted content includes formats that do not follow a written story (for example, entertainment, game shows or reality shows), which are the majority of the formats we develop; while scripted content includes formats that follow a written scenario, mainly drama and comedy. We have historically focused on developing non-scripted formats, which is the core 191 ----- business implemented by our founder and Chairman, Stéphane Courbit. Non-scripted formats benefit from lower production costs, a shorter development period and more advantageous financing arrangements, because the broadcaster who purchases the non-scripted format typically funds the full production costs. Non-scripted formats can generate significant secondary revenues because they can be licensed and produced in several countries under different names. For example, a game show with a strong brand awareness can be developed in many countries, sometimes under different names but with an identical concept. Several large production groups, such as ITV Studios or Fremantle, have grown by exporting successful non-scripted formats in all countries where they maintain operations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, non-scripted contents generated in total €615.1 million, or 85.9%, of our production revenues. On the other hand, scripted formats require higher upfront development costs and often need to be co-produced by several parties. We have significantly expanded our scripted activity to meet our customers’ and the market’s increasing demand for scripted content. We currently have companies producing scripted programming in the majority of the 16 countries where we are present. Scripted programs can also generate significant secondary revenues, especially if such programs are in English because they can be sold worldwide to broadcasters and to local or global digital platforms. We develop new formats in each of our geographic markets. Our local subsidiaries have their own creative teams which work together with a central content team at the Group-level. Our central content team coordinates the local teams, keeps them informed of market trends outside their own territories and contributes to the creation of formats that address both local markets needs and global trends. If successful, these formats may be licensed and used in different markets and via different platforms. We develop original formats and programs in five principal genres: Non-scripted: - _Entertainment and Talk Shows: Entertainment and talk shows mainly encompass entertainment formats and programs that are studio-based. We believe our most successful entertainment programs include _Touche pas à mon poste! (internationally named It’s Only TV!), Go, Beat the Star, Versus, All Against 1, Fort Boyard, Big Class Reunion, The Best Singers and Child Support. Entertainment titles have_ significant potential for secondary format sales because they are easily adaptable to different local markets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our entertainment content and talk shows generated €183.6 million in production revenues. - _Reality: Reality includes television programs in which ordinary people are continuously filmed outside their usual environment, designed to be entertaining rather than informative. We believe our most successful reality programs include: The Challenge, Real World, Paradise Hotel, Survivor, Temptation _Island, and Party Workers (called Les Marseillais and Les Ch’tis in France). For the year ended_ December 31, 2018, our reality content programs generated €179.8 million in production revenues. - _Factual_ _Entertainment:_ Factual entertainment is a combination of factual/documentary and entertainment programs, focusing on social experiments and popular topics. We believe our most successful factual entertainment programs include The Secret Life of 4 Year Olds, Location, Location, _Location, Revealed, Wife Swap, Keeping up with the Kardashians, Ball in the Family and Eat Well For Less. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our factual entertainment content programs generated_ €134.6 million in production revenues. - _Game Shows: Game shows are predominantly programs in which contestants compete for prizes during games of knowledge, physical challenges or by luck. We believe our most successful game shows include Don’t Forget the Lyrics!, Tipping Point, Killer Karaoke and The Legacy. Game shows have significant potential for secondary format sales because they are easily adaptable to different local markets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our game show content programs generated €92.1 million in production revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, other genres of non-scripted content programs generated €25.0 million in production revenues. Scripted: _Scripted: Scripted includes drama, docu-drama and scripted comedy filmed in several programs following a_ written script. We believe our most successful drama programs include Versailles, Wallander, Occupied, _Millennium, Wolf Creek and Saint Tropez (Sous le soleil). Successful docu-drama brands include American_ 192 ----- _Playboy and Roman Empire. Formatted comedy series include Solsidan, Ladykracher and Pastewka. For the year_ ended December 31, 2018, our scripted content programs (excluding kid’s programming) generated €91.5 million in production revenues and other genres of programs (including kid’s programming) generated an additional €9.3 million in production revenues. Once a concept has been selected, our teams develop the format itself, through the creation of mechanics, game play, casting, set and music.

These formats and programs are assets that continue to generate secondary revenues through various channels, other than the initial sale to a broadcaster or digital platform. We own all or part of the intellectual property rights to a broad and diversified portfolio of existing formats and programs, for which distribution rights are granted to Banijay Rights Limited. We distribute both formats and programs that we have produced and formats and programs in which we have acquired intellectual property rights but that have been produced by a third-party production company. Through our distribution business, we have, for example, distributed Versailles to 238 territories. Approximately 24% of the catalogue, in terms of hours of programs, of our distribution business consists of third-party programming from independent producers without their own distribution business and networks from around the globe. We distribute the content we own and license through Banijay Rights Limited to a traditional customer base of broadcasters and producers as well as VOD platforms. We license our portfolio of formats to producers, broadcasters and digital platforms, who can acquire from Banijay Rights Limited an option to pitch our formats to broadcasters. Once the format is commissioned by such broadcaster, such licensee acquires a license of the format through a format license agreement in order to produce a program based on such format and allow the broadcaster or digital platform to air the program as per the terms of the format license agreement. The licensees pay us an option fee to be granted the right to pitch the format and a format fee upon signing of the format license agreement once a commission is confirmed. In consideration of such format fee, they are allowed to produce a program based on our format and to air it in their local territory for a certain period of time. _Distribution of Programs to Broadcasters_ We distribute our portfolio of television programs directly to linear broadcasters, basic and premium cable networks, and international pay-television distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales of programs to broadcasters represented 61.6% of our distribution revenues. The broadcasters pay us a license fee in return for the right to air a program across a given period of time and for a given number of runs. Banijay Rights Limited receives a commission on that license fee for its distribution activity, and the remainder of the license fee is paid to the owner of the program (i.e., either our local production company owning the intellectual property rights or the third-party owner of the intellectual property rights). 194 ----- _Distribution of Programs to Digital Platforms_ We distribute our portfolio of television program titles to digital platforms, including SVOD providers such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Video and AVOD platforms such as Facebook Watch. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, 31.2% and 38.4%, respectively, of the gross revenues of our distribution business was generated through the revenues from the sales of our portfolio of programs licensed to VOD platforms such as Facebook Watch, Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video and Netflix and other revenues allocated to other digital platforms (mainly SVOD rights). In the United States and, to a lesser extent, Europe, consumers, particularly younger consumers, are viewing more content on more devices and through SVOD or AVOD platforms, such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Roku. SVOD requires consumers to enter into a subscription contract giving the consumer access to content, including exclusive content, from the digital platform. In the United States, SVOD services have increased the value of our catalogue series and movies due to increased viewership by consumers and the correlating demand and spending by digital platforms. Netflix, for example, reported that it had spent $12 billion in acquiring content in 2018. However, SVOD services specifically and the OTT model generally remain less widespread in Europe due to free-to-air offerings and the lower cost of pay-television bundles in Europe compared to the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we have license agreements with most of the main digital platforms and aim to further expand our agreements with them. These customers, such as Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, use our content on their platforms. These partnerships allow subscribers of the relevant networks to access our programs across a variety of devices. As of December 31, 2018, our content was available to approximately 260 million subscribers indirectly through our partnerships with Amazon Prime Video and Netflix. _Other Secondary Revenues_ Other secondary revenues include revenues from commercial activities related to our formats, such as merchandizing, DVD sales, music and events. Other secondary revenues complement revenues from the initial sale to broadcasters and digital platforms and our distribution revenues.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

We usually approach broadcasters and digital platforms with a detailed presentation and/or a trailer for non-scripted formats, but when we present a scripted format, our pitch consists of a logline, a synopsis and a treatment. A logline is a onesentence description of the show. A “synopsis” is a brief summary of the show that includes information about the main characters and the theme of the show. A “treatment” is the more detailed, in that it includes detailed descriptions of the characters and the show’s plot. We also develop, in some instances, a trailer or a full pilot for a television show. We provide broadcasters with detailed project timelines and budget plans for production and negotiate with them to agree on the terms of their acquisition of rights to our programs, particularly with respect to pricing and retaining intellectual property rights that will enable us to generate secondary sales across various platforms and distribute the program in other regions. Key negotiation points include: (i) the duration of the license; (ii) the scope of rights granted to digital platforms and broadcasters, such as free VOD services (as discussed below) and ancillary rights; and (iii) holdbacks and options for renewal. We use our combined resources across other production projects and our expertise to propose competitive and lean production plans to broadcasters. _Production Process_ Once a format has been developed and sold to a broadcaster or digital platform, we begin the production process and produce a program based on such format. The process consists of producing and filming the show, editing the content as well as choosing and, when possible, publishing and producing the soundtrack. We operate a fully funded production model for the majority of our programs whereby broadcasters commit upfront to fund the full cost of the production in exchange for their right to use the program within the scope agreed with them. If broadcasters pay us after we incur production costs, we may fund this shortfall through financing arrangements 193 ----- or through our working capital. If we have longer cash flow shortfalls, in particular for scripted projects, we aim for broadcasters to cover our financing costs. Broadcasters also often receive a portion of the secondary revenues and, subject to market trends and our bargaining power, a portion of the intellectual property rights to the format or the program. We aim to keep intellectual property rights to our programs. Rights to a program are easier to protect than rights to a format, because a program is a finished product that has already aired, compared to a formalized concept. However, certain of our customers with an international footprint through distribution or broadcasting (such as large broadcasters or SVOD platforms) may ask to retain a portion or all of the intellectual property rights of our programs, depending on market practices. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business— _Customers may request to obtain intellectual property rights to the formats we create and programs we produce, which may have a negative impact on our revenues.”_ We have implemented cost-efficient, flexible and scalable production processes throughout our Group. For example, we use freelancers and lease production facilities in order to limit our investment in fixed assets. We have also implemented strict cost control, in order to deliver final programs on time and respect customers’ budgets. Cost control is especially important for scripted programs which require higher costs and longer production processes than non-scripted programs. _Internal Circulation of Our Formats_ As an independent production group, one of our major strengths is our network of producers who have exclusive access to our catalogue of formats in their respective geographic markets. This internal feed of formats is key for our local Group companies. We prioritize the production of successful formats in the markets in which we operate. Our central content team centralizes all the relevant information and material on new formats and upcoming, promising titles are circulated among our production companies. For example, Temptation Island, _Wife Swap, The Secret Life of 4 Year Olds, All Against 1, Eat Well for Less and Location, Location, Location are_ successful formats developed by one of our production companies in a given market and then produced by several of our production companies in their respective markets.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Production companies in the United States also have greater exposure to content production and licensing revenues. In the United States, independent producers are mainly contracted to provide non-scripted formats to broadcast networks, and increasingly also to cable networks, while drama series tend to be produced in-house by these networks and digital platforms, such as HBO. Recent acquisitions of independent producers by large media companies seeking vertical integration or by larger independent production groups illustrate the strategic importance of geographical presence and access to content. Acquisitions enable market players to increase their content library and distribution capabilities and expand to different countries and distribution channels. Ongoing market consolidation has led to the creation of a few large international television production and distribution groups, including our biggest competitors, Fremantle, BBC Worldwide and ITV Studios Group Entertainment, each of which provide their local production companies with exclusive access to their catalogues. Our competitive position is greatly affected by the quality of, and public response to, our content. We also compete with other production companies and studios for the services of creative talents, producers, directors, writers, actors and others and for the acquisition of intellectual property. _Distribution_ We also face competition for the licensing and distribution of our formats and programs. As a distributor of programs, we compete with other studios, television production groups and independent producers. 200 ----- New opportunities in the production and distribution business have emerged due to the growing demand for new programs. Audience fragmentation has increased due to digital platforms, both global, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, and regional and local, such as Britbox in the United Kingdom and Hulu in the United States.

We also compete for viewers’ time against other forms of entertainment, including other television networks, premium pay-television services, local over-the-air television stations, OTT services, motion pictures, home entertainment products and services, video games, print media, live events, radio broadcasts and other forms of news, information and entertainment, as well as pirated content.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

We developed this format into a successful program in Sweden and Norway where it aired in 2014 and 2015. At the end of 2014, we began to develop the format for a program in France through our subsidiary, Adventure Line Productions, with Argentina chosen as the location for the first series. Adventure Line Productions had subcontracted the logistics of the show to a specialized company, SAX Logistica (“SAX”). On March 9, 2015, two helicopters took off from Villa Catelli (La Rioja province) in Argentina carrying three contestants (renowned yachtswoman Florence Arthaud, Olympic champion swimmer Camille Muffat and Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine) and five employees of Adventure Line Productions. The helicopters collided with each other shortly after takeoff causing the deaths of all the passengers onboard each helicopter and the two pilots. Following the crash, the Argentinean federal prosecutor initiated a criminal investigation. Argentina’s aviation investigations unit, JIAAC, concluded that the crash had occurred because the pilots, although both experienced, failed to realize how close the helicopters were to each other as they were flying. The Argentinean judge in charge of the investigation has requested the depositions of the director of aviation for the La Rioja province, the secretary for tourism for the province and two individuals representing SAX, each of whom have been indicted. The helicopters that SAX provided were owned by the La Rioja province and the two pilots were employed by the La Rioja province. In France, the Paris prosecutor received Adventure Line Productions as a supervised witness (témoin assisté), a process by which a witness is questioned by the court in the presence of an attorney. Adventure Line Productions has not been indicted as of the date of this offering memorandum. The criminal investigations in Argentina and France are ongoing. The families of the five deceased employees of Adventure Line Productions have initiated separate civil actions against Adventure Line Productions and are requesting aggregate damages of approximately €3.8 million. Hearing dates have not been set for two of these claims, while the three other claims have been deferred or suspended, either in the first instance or by a court of appeal, until completion of the criminal investigation. In addition, the families of two of the three athletes who died in the crash have filed civil claims against Adventure Line Productions for damages, with one claim amounting to €4.2 million and with the other family still estimating the damages incurred. Both cases have been deferred until the outcome of the criminal proceedings or until further actions from the plaintiffs. Our production risks insurer, Liberty Syndicates Management Ltd. (“LSM”), paid €2.1 million to Adventure Line Productions in connection with this event. LSM then filed a civil claim against SAX, which was rejected by the Commercial Court of Paris. LSM appealed this decision in July 2019. Separately, Adventure Line Productions has filed a lawsuit against AXA based on our professional liability insurance for any potential damages (subject to insurance limitations and exclusions) awarded to the families of the victims in connection with the pending civil actions. In September 2019, this case was deferred as the criminal proceedings are still ongoing. _Koh Lanta_ In 2013, a participant in Koh Lanta (the French version of Survivor), a reality program we produce in France through Adventure Line Productions, died as a result of a heart attack during the filming of the program. 203 ----- Following his death, a French court opened a criminal investigation into whether anyone had caused the involuntary manslaughter of the participant. It has since been established that the participant suffered from a pre-existing heart condition. While the family and heirs of the participant have not initiated any civil proceedings, the criminal investigation is still pending. We expect the court to drop the case but are not a party to the investigation and therefore do not have access to court documents. Based on the information received to date, we will continue to argue that the death of the participant was the result of natural causes and that our production company was not in any way responsible. _Zodiak Belgium_ In 2019, Zodiak Belgium N.V. (“Zodiak Belgium”) initiated criminal proceedings against, among others, its former CFO and former CEO and Managing Director, on the basis of unlawful practices within Zodiak Belgium. Such practices involved the creation of fraudulent invoices to companies owned by, or otherwise related to, the former CFO, cash withdrawals, cash payments to employees and certain third parties, fictitious expense notes and fictitious invoices to foreign companies, amounting to approximately €11 million over the course of eight years. In March 2019, Zodiak Belgium terminated its agreements with the former CFO and former CEO, which the CFO has challenged before a commercial court. The former CEO has repaid €140,000 as compensation for cash he received. Zodiak Belgium is also seeking, as part of its criminal claim, the reimbursement by its former CFO of all amounts improperly disbursed by him or certain related parties. Following the results of this investigation, we have also focused on improving our internal compliance and control mechanisms at our production companies. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our success is dependent, in part, _upon the integrity of our management and employees, and our risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect violations of law.”_ From time to time, Endemol Shine is party to a variety of claims and legal proceedings (including personnel and tax related claims) considered typical for its businesses.

Ltd. S¸ti. (“Endemol Shine Turkey”) was insolvent as its liabilities exceeded its assets and it was no longer able to pay its debts as they fell due. It was also determined that management at Endemol Shine Turkey obtained unauthorized loans and issued several checks in contravention of Endemol Shine’s governance policies. In May and June of 2017, two members of the local management team implicated in the aforementioned mismanagement were dismissed. On June 30, 2017, the shareholders of Endemol Shine Turkey applied for bankruptcy. Various claims were filed against Endemol Shine Turkey due to unpaid debts and checks. At the hearing on January 9, 2020, the court announced the dismissal of the bankruptcy application of Endemol Shine Turkey. Such determination was subject to two expert financial reports produced by a panel of financial and sectoral experts delivered to the court in 2019. The court’s reasoning behind this decision is not yet known, as the court has not yet made its detailed written decision available. The court is expected to issue and notify the parties of its reasoned decision between two and four weeks after the hearing held on January 9, 2020. The decision of the court will become definite either (i) after an appellate review, if Endemol Shine Turkey or any of the creditors who are party to the bankruptcy case submit an appeal within two weeks of the issuance of the reasoned decision or (ii) once such two week period after the issuance of the reasoned decision lapses without Endemol Shine Turkey or any creditor who is party to the bankruptcy case appealing the decision. At the January 9, 2020 hearing, the court also decided that the court-appointed managing administrations who are authorized to carry out “urgent and financial” matters on behalf of Endemol Shine Turkey will remain in charge until the decision becomes definite. The managing administrators were originally appointed by the court back in October 2017 as “audit administrators” whose role was to independently audit any payments, expenses, money transfers and assignments made by Endemol Shine Turkey. At the hearing dated June 7, 2018, the court decided to extend the powers of the audit administrators to “managing” administrators, effectively giving them the power to make decisions in relation to Endemol Shine Turkey with regard only to “urgent and financial” matters. Further, Endemol Shine Turkey has entered into three settlement agreements with tax authorities: two for unpaid tax debts (taxes arising from two different laws) and one for the unpaid social security premium payments. There are no written agreements for these settlements, as the arrangements are made through the online system of the authorities. The implicated members of management have initiated labor lawsuits against Endemol Shine Turkey alleging wrongful termination of their employment contracts. These labor lawsuits are still pending. Endemol Shine has initiated separate criminal and civil proceedings against former management, which proceedings are continuing. In addition, a number of third-party criminal proceedings have been brought against Endemol Shine Turkey’s representatives in connection with post-dated checks issued by former managers during such former managers’ employment, all of which have been dismissed to date with one remaining subject to an appeal. _Core Media Group_ In April 2016, CORE Entertainment Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (the “CORE Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). In September 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved the bankruptcy plan proposed by the CORE Debtors, which provides for a significant 219 ----- de-leveraging of the CORE Debtors. Under the bankruptcy plan, general unsecured creditors are entitled to share _pro rata in a distribution of cash (up to an aggregate amount of $2,375,000), as well as a certain distribution from_ a litigation trust (the “Litigation Trust”) that was created in connection with the bankruptcy, and holders of equity interests would not receive any distribution on account thereof. In December 2016, the Litigation Trust filed a lawsuit in the state courts of California against entities affiliated with Apollo, Twenty-First Century Fox and Endemol Shine. That case was ultimately stayed in California and refiled in the state courts of New York. The complaint alleged that the defendants intentionally interfered with loan agreements reached between the CORE Debtors and their lenders, and that certain of the defendants, including Endemol Shine, were liable for the breach of such loan agreements. Endemol Shine filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. In April 2018, the Litigation Trust filed two additional lawsuits in the Bankruptcy Court. The first lawsuit named various individuals and entities affiliated with Apollo and Endemol Shine as defendants, and brought claims for breach of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duties and fraudulent transfer. That lawsuit did not assert any specific claim against Endemol Shine, and on August 23, 2018, the Litigation Trust filed a Notice of Dismissal which voluntarily dismissed Endemol Shine from this lawsuit without prejudice. The second lawsuit claimed that Endemol Shine was liable for actual and constructive fraudulent transfer of international distribution rights to The Wall, which complaint was later amended to allege conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment and imposition of a constructive trust. All parties to each of these lawsuits reached a settlement agreement in September 2019, pursuant to which the parties sought dismissal of the outstanding lawsuits with prejudice and the settlement amount was paid in October 2019. _Wipeout_ Two persons involved in the creation of Wipeout entered into a revenue participation agreement with Endemol USA Inc. In March 2018, following an audit of the account issued pursuant to the revenue participation agreement, counsel for these persons issued letters demanding payment in the sum of $8.0 million from Endemol USA Inc. These persons claimed that the audit indicated that the back-end participation payments paid during the period were less than what was required under the Revenue Participation Agreement. A mediation took place in November 2018 and did not result in a settlement as the parties were unable to agree on, among other things, a settlement amount. As the parties have not been able to agree a settlement, a sole arbitrator has been appointed with arbitration proceedings scheduled to commence in March 2020. _Endemol Shine Belgium_ Prior to 2011, Endemol Shine Belgium N.V. (“ESB”) produced call television shows under an agreement with the broadcaster VMMA/Medialaan N.V. (“Medialaan”) to be aired on its on channel VTM in Belgium. Viewers could participate in the shows through SMS or dialing a telephone number. For participation, an all-in price was charged to the participants through their telephone bill. VAT was included in that all-in price as it was regarded as a telephone cost. Following a cascade system, the telephone operators shared the revenues with ESB, Medialaan and the service provider Paratel. Following a January 2011 audit, the Belgian tax authorities issued a game and VAT tax assessment against Endemol Shine Belgium for the financial years 2008 to 2010 in the amount of €4,233,296.51 for game tax and VAT. The maximum possible assessment is €6.0 million (excluding interest and penalties). The claims are currently pending with the Supreme Court Counsel before a date is set for the final hearing. 220 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Based on the definition of independent producer in each Relevant Member State, we are independent with respect to all major broadcasters worldwide except for Canal Plus in France. There are no similar regulations in the countries outside Europe in which we operate. Directive 2018/1808/EU extended the scope of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive with specific measures for video sharing platforms and social networks, as well as livestreaming platforms. The Audiovisual Media Services Directive also requires that 30% of the catalogues of audiovisual on demand media services are created in Europe and the application of Member States’ rules to financial contributions from broadcasters and OTT platforms. Member States have until September 19, 2020 to implement Directive 2018/1808/EU. In addition to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, certain Member States such as the United Kingdom and France impose additional requirements on broadcasters in relation to the broadcasting of certain types of programs produced by independent producers. - In the United Kingdom, a new regulation introduced by the Communications Act 2003 set out two key provisions to develop independent production of television content. Public service broadcasters in the United Kingdom have to secure a minimum of 25% of their qualifying programming in each year for independent producers in order to receive a license to broadcast from the Office of Communications, the government-approved regulatory and competition authority for the broadcasting and telecommunications industries of the United Kingdom. In addition, certain broadcasters in the United Kingdom can only produce in-house content within a limited framework or, in some instances, not at all. For example, C4 is not permitted to produce any of its programs in-house. - In France, broadcasters are subject to (i) quotas of production whereby broadcasters must contribute to specific independent audiovisual works (called “oeuvres audiovisuelles” with a sub-quota for “oeuvres _patrimoniales”), with a certain percentage of the broadcasters’ revenues to be invested in such specific_ independent audiovisual works, and (ii) quotas of programs aired whereby broadcasters must air specific independent audiovisual works. These quotas vary from one broadcaster to another. The quotas for each broadcaster are negotiated with professional unions of independent producers. They are included in each broadcaster’s license agreement with governmental authority CSA. The other specific regulations applicable to our business are employment-related regulations, including regulations governing unions and guilds that can materially impact the production cost of programs and the 204 ----- secondary revenues generated by such programs (for example, minimum wages, limitations on number of working days/hours and payment of residuals). Specific regulations may also apply to certain productions (for example, children or animals participating in programs, health and safety rules, product placement rules and rules governing the use of monuments or art). 205 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

(“Fox”) formed Endemol Shine as part of a joint venture, in which Apollo and Fox would each beneficially own 50%. In connection with the joint venture, Fox contributed its interests in Shine Group and Apollo contributed its interests in Endemol Shine, which it had acquired in August 2014, and in the CORE Media Group, in each case, for the beneficial ownership of Endemol Shine. Endemol Shine, together with its subsidiaries, has become a global multi-platform content provider known as the Endemol Shine Group. Endemol N.V. was founded in 1994 by a merger of television production companies owned by Joop van den Ende and John de Mol. It had rapidly expanded through acquisitions and internally developed start-ups, to become a leading format creation and production company. Endemol N.V.’s indirect parent company, Endemol Holding N.V. was listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 1996. Telefónica made a public offer for all of the outstanding shares of Endemol Holding N.V. in 2000, pursuant to which it acquired 99.7% of such shares. Shine TV was founded in March 2001. It became Shine Group in 2006, following the acquisitions of Kudos Film and Television, Princess Productions and Dragonfly Film and Television Productions. Shine Group began as a UK production company and expanded in the international market, including by acquiring Metronome in the Nordic Countries and Reveille in the United States. Prior to the Endemol and Shine combination, Shine Group became a multi-genre company creating and producing popular, compelling and quality entertainment, features, factual, specialist factual and drama programming, including many United Kingdom and international hits. On March 20, 2019, The Walt Disney Company (“Disney”) acquired Fox, as well as the majority of Fox’s entertainment and international assets, including its 50% shareholding in Endemol Shine. With its head office in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Endemol Shine has subsidiaries and joint ventures with physical production presence in 20 countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands, as well as in Mexico, Brazil, India and Australia.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Endemol Shine aired more than 75 scripted titles across more than 50 platforms in more than 15 different territories in 2018, approximately half of which were new launches. Endemol Shine’s network of scripted producers work with local writers and directors to develop ideas and packages to pitch to local broadcasters. Given scripted shows generate the highest levels of investments from broadcasters, more time is spent on the quality of the writing in the first instance, and development lead times can often be lengthy. Producers then work with broadcasters to ensure that they attach the right cast for local and international audiences. Once a show is formally approved, it enters into pre-production and preparation begins. Once filming ends, the producer will work with the editor until the program is delivered to the broadcaster.

Endemol Shine has two distribution entities: Endemol Shine International Limited (“ESI”) and Endemol Shine IP B.V. (“ESIP”). - ESI is located in the United Kingdom and is mainly focused on the distribution of programs (although in some regions, such as South East Asia, for example, ESI may also act as format sales agent for the Group). ESI has grown its catalogue to approximately 65,000 hours of owned and third-party content across all genres. Approximately 21% of the ESI catalogue, in terms of programming hours, consists of third-party programs. Revenues generated by ESI in 2018 were supported by stronger program sales of multiple versions of Big Brother and MasterChef, as well as the addition of key scripted shows such as _Troy, Humans and Younger._ - ESIP is located in the Netherlands and is mainly focused on the licensing of Endemol Shine or thirdparty formats to third-party production companies for production outside of the territories where Endemol Shine has a physical production presence or operating companies. Endemol Shine’s distribution and format licensing business works as follows: - Formats: In countries where Endemol Shine has local production companies, typically formats are licensed as part of production commission arrangements by the local production companies. In countries where Endemol Shine has no local production company, typically ESIP licenses formats to third parties through format license agreements allowing the third parties to produce formats as per the terms of such format license agreements. - Programs: Programs based on Endemol Shine intellectual property are mostly distributed via ESI. ESI charges a distribution fee and recoups against its investment, if applicable.

Further, ESI distributes third-party owned programs. In such cases, ESI charges a distribution fee and shares the remaining distribution revenues with the original intellectual property creator. Where additional funding is needed beyond a broadcaster commitment and tax credits, ESI might make available an investment against the acquisition of the distribution rights, such as a distribution advance. Such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and driven by ESI and Endemol Shine’s views on the commercial potential of the program. Endemol Shine is platform-agnostic and distributes content to both traditional linear channels and AVOD and SVOD platforms and has been increasing its commercial focus on the FAANG, as well as other global and regional streaming platforms. Endemol Shine has scheduled over ten launches over the next six months with distribution channels across the world on electronic sell-through or “EST” (iTunes, Google), TVOD (Vobile) and AVOD (TiVo, Vudu, Roku) models.

Where the design or build of a game is complex and requires specific specialization, licenses may be granted to third-party producers. Endemol Shine games include Deal or No Deal and The Money Drop. - Licensing and merchandising: Endemol Shine licenses Endemol Shine-controlled intellectual property through the creation and management of contracts between Endemol Shine and third parties that want to use a particular brand in association with a product for an agreed period of time, within an agreed territory. MasterChef, Mr. Bean, and Peaky Blinders are some of Endemol Shine’s key focus titles for licensing and merchandising exploitation. - Digital exploitation: Endemol Shine’s digital business runs across three distinct pillars – digital commercial, sponsorship and digital inventory. - Digital inventory: the largest digital segment, encompasses primarily the monetization of Endemol Shine’s content through digital platforms like YouTube. Video views to official Endemol Shine online video content totaled approximately 15 billion for the period from January 2019 to November 2019, representing a 49% increase compared to the same period in 2018, fueled by the popularity of global properties, such as Mr. Bean, MasterChef, Big Brother and Wipeout. Mr. Bean was awarded the YouTube Diamond Play Button for surpassing ten million subscribers in October 2018. The official page has since grown to approximately 17 million subscribers. Mr. Bean remained the number one television entertainment brand on Facebook in 2019 (Mr. Bean’s live action page remains the eleventh most liked Facebook page), with over 90 million followers, including Mr. Bean’s animated Facebook page. In total, across Endemol Shine’s YouTube network, the total watch time of Endemol Shine content has increased to over 87 billion minutes in the first nine months of 2019, an increase of 17.0% from the same period in 2018. - Digital commercial: encompasses all revenue-generating in-program exploitation of digital technology and includes voting, polling, SMS and call TV. - Sponsorship: encompasses integrated sponsorship deals, both online and TV and on-air product placement on content Endemol Shine produces, selling brands a share of the content. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Endemol Shine’s other (commercial exploitation) business generated direct gross profit margin of 52.2%. 211 ----- Endemol Shine’s Sales Strategy: Endemol Shine’s sales business strategy is based on three pillars and covers both distribution sales and commercial exploitation. The first strategic pillar of the Endemol Shine sales business is continued access to Endemol Shine’s highquality multi-genre intellectual property, including both Endemol Shine-owned intellectual property and third party-owned intellectual property. This includes increasing the focus on non-English language scripted content to broaden the catalogue available. The second strategic pillar is to increase the sell-through rate of an existing catalogue, through selling to more platforms (including streaming and other digital platforms), monetization of unexploited parts of the existing catalogue and selling across all available rights channels. The third strategic pillar of the Endemol Shine sales business is to increase yield from the existing catalogue, including through improved channel management, increased bid density and implementation of a pricing strategy.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of a Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (4) describing the procedures determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, consistent with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased; and (5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Euro Senior Secured Note or Dollar Senior Secured Note, as applicable, equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Euro Senior Secured 278 ----- Notes or Dollar Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Euro Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and each such Dollar Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, or an offer or other transaction that if consummated would result in a Change of Control has been publicly announced and, if applicable, not withdrawn, at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Senior Secured Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may require prepayment and cancellation or other consequences in respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement. Future debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Senior Secured Notes Issuer from purchasing Senior Secured Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral— The _Issuers may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer and, if this occurs, the Issuers would be in default under the Indentures.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a 279 ----- disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

and (10) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (b) the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency 285 ----- Agreement and, otherwise, the euro equivalent of such amount plus the euro equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. For purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” under this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal consolidated financial statements are available as at the time that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries obtains new commitments (in the case of revolving facilities) or Incurs new Indebtedness (in the case of term facilities or other Indebtedness). Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Completion Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Secured Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the Holders that the two conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this heading have been satisfied, provided that such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obligated to notify Holders of such event. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an investment grade rating.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of such indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding); and (5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60 day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) reasonably satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default or an Event of Default, their status and what action the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Senior Secured Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its 311 ----- satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Senior Note or any Senior Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee, with a copy to the Paying Agent, an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of a Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (4) describing the procedures determined by the Senior Notes Issuer, consistent with the Senior Notes Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Notes repurchased; and (5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Notes so tendered; 372 ----- (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior Notes Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Senior Note, equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Notes Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, or an offer or other transaction that if consummated would result in a Change of Control has been publicly announced and, if applicable, not withdrawn, at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Senior Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Senior Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may require prepayment and cancellation or other consequences in respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement. Future debt of the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Senior Notes Issuer from purchasing Senior Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to purchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Senior Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Senior Notes Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Senior Notes. See 373 ----- “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Issuers may not be able to _raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer and, if this occurs, the Issuers would be in default under the Indentures.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (b) the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the euro equivalent of such amount plus the euro equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. For purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” under this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured for the Senior Notes Issuer’s most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal consolidated financial statements are available as at the time that the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries obtains new commitments (in the case of revolving facilities) or Incurs new Indebtedness (in the case of term facilities or other Indebtedness). Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

All pro forma financial information shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies of the Senior Notes Issuer (or other reporting entity, as applicable). Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer. The filing of an Annual Report on Form 20-F within the time period specified in clause (1) will satisfy such provision. At any time that any of the Senior Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed 393 ----- presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following items: revenue, EBITDA, profit (loss) for the year, cash, total assets, long term borrowings and other financial liabilities, total equity, capital expenditures and interest expenses.

So long as Senior Notes are outstanding, the Senior Notes Issuer will, in connection with delivery of the annual and quarterly reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, hold a conference call to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period. Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined by the Senior Notes Issuer in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Senior Notes Issuer determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the Senior Notes. Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity are listed on a Recognized Stock Exchange and the Senior Notes Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on such Recognized Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, the Senior Notes Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Senior Notes Issuer is, or would be, required to file with such Recognized Stock Exchange. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements require the Senior Notes Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual and semi-annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the Recognized Stock Exchange, as applicable, and provided, further, that the Senior Notes Issuer, such Parent or such IPO Entity, as applicable, additionally provides the reports set forth in clause (2) above with respect to its first and third fiscal quarters, the Senior Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. “Recognized Stock Exchange” means a regulated market operated by any of Euronext, the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, the London Stock Exchange (including, for the avoidance of doubt, AIM and Main Market listings) or such other similar regulated securities exchange. The Senior Notes Issuer may satisfy its obligations and the requirements of this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Senior Notes Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to any Parent consolidating reporting at its level in a manner consistent with that described in this covenant; provided that such financial information is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Parent and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand. At the Senior Notes Issuer’s election, for any relevant reporting period, the financial statements, information, auditors’ reports and other documents or information required to be provided as described in the preceding paragraphs of this “—Reports” covenant, may be, rather than those of the Senior Notes Issuer, those of the Senior Notes Issuer itself. In addition, so long as the Senior Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Senior Notes Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Senior Notes Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Senior Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports” covenant is for information purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein, include the Senior Notes Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Senior Notes Indenture. 394 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Senior Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of such Senior Notes Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) reasonably satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Senior Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

It may 402 ----- not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the posttrade settlement amongst direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, they also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

If such payments are made in a Non-Cooperative State, a 75% mandatory withholding tax is applicable (subject to certain exceptions, certain of which are set forth below and to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty). The 75% withholding tax is applicable irrespective of the noteholder’s tax residence or registered headquarters. The list of Non-Cooperative States is, in principle, updated each year. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Capital Structure—The adoption by the Council of the European Union of _an EU list of non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes and the use of this list in the jurisdictions where we operate may impact our financial results.”_ Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest on debt and other assimilated revenues paid by a debtor or an issuer of notes that is established in France may not be deductible from the debtor’s or the issuer’s taxable income if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a privileged tax jurisdiction (i.e., where such persons would be subject to a tax lower than 50% (or lower than 40% as from January 1, 2020 pursuant to the Law that aims at fighting tax fraud)) of the tax they would have incurred had they been domiciled or established in France or in a Non-Cooperative State or paid to a bank account opened in a financial institution located in such a privileged tax jurisdiction or in such a Non-Cooperative State within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (including those mentioned in Article 238-0 A 2 bis 2° of the same code). Under certain conditions, any such nondeductible interest and other assimilated revenues may be recharacterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case it may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at a rate of (i) 75% if they are paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in a Non-Cooperative State, (ii) 30% if they are paid to non-French tax resident corporate or other legal entities (it being noted that according to the French Finance Law for 2020 such withholding tax rate shall vary in line with the reduction of the common rate 448 ----- of French corporate income tax provided for by Article 219 I of the French Tax Code for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2020) or (iii) 12.8% in cases where the holder is a non-French tax resident individual, in each case subject to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax provided by Article 125 A-III of the French Tax Code nor, to the extent the relevant interest and other assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and is not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the non-deductibility set forth under Article 238 A of the French Tax Code and the related withholding tax set forth under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code which may be levied as a consequence of such non-deductibility, will apply in respect of a particular issue of debt instruments (including debt in the form of notes such as the Notes) provided that the debtor or the issuer can prove that the main purpose and effect of such issuance is not to enable payments of interest or other assimilated revenues to be made in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”).

For this purpose, an “equivalent offer” means any offer requiring the registration or submission of an offer document by or with a foreign securities market authority; - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or a multilateral securities trading system, provided that such market or system is not located in a Non-Cooperative State and the operation of such market is carried out by a market operator or an investment services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity, provided further that such market operator, investment services provider or entity is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; or - admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities clearing delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators, provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

Accordingly, payments of interest and other assimilated revenues with respect to the Notes will be exempt from the withholding tax set forth under Article 125 A-III of the French Tax Code. Moreover, under the same conditions and to the extent that the relevant interest and other assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, they will be subject neither to the non-deductibility set forth under Article 238 A of the French Tax Code nor to the withholding tax set forth under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code solely on account of their being paid to a bank account opened in a financial institution located in a Non-Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in such a Non-Cooperative State.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any of the following: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a U.S. person.

We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. A tax treatment of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes different from those discussed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes. This summary is general in nature and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal taxation or all tax considerations that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of its particular circumstances.

Although the issue is_ not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paying such additional amounts, or making additional payments in redemption of the Notes, does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. holder may be required to accrue interest income on 451 ----- its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes generally would be recharacterized as ordinary income.

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. holder that receives an interest payment in foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. No foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the receipt of such payment (other than foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the euros so received; see “—Disposition of Foreign Currency”).

Under the first method, the amount of interest income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year). Under the second method, the U.S. holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or other disposition of a Note) denominated in foreign currency, an accrual basis U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date of receipt) in respect of an accrual period and the amount previously accrued during such accrual period (as described above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the sale or other disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss. Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, any gain or loss that a U.S. holder recognizes on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if such holder has held the Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) generally are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively, and generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and not be treated as interest income or expense. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of a Note is the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Note. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder disposes of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued interest, which will be treated as discussed under “—Interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will realize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement). Individuals (and, under proposed Treasury Regulations, certain entities) who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value exceeding certain threshold amounts, generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in a financial account at certain financial institutions. Prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these rules on their investment in the Notes. _Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_ In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and stated interest on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient (such as a corporation), and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) will be required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, on such payments if: (i) the U.S. holder fails to furnish an accurate taxpayer identification number or to establish an exemption from backup withholding; (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the taxpayer identification number furnished by the U.S. holder is incorrect; (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the U.S. holder has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number, that it is a U.S. person, and that the IRS has not notified such U.S. holder that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability. You may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information. _Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_ Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” made after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining the term “foreign passthru payments” to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” and exempt from FATCA withholding unless such obligations are materially modified after such date. As of the date of this offering memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuers are treated as a “foreign financial institution,” FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Many non-U.S. governments (including the government of France) have entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there generally will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount. 454 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Pursuant to regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015, on insolvency proceedings (recast), as modified (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its centre of main interests, or “COMI” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the COMI of a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual centre of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If the COMI of a debtor is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If the COMI of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be 455 ----- secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, secondary insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law or (ii) the secondary insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor that is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex _fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency_ proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides (a) for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) jurisdictions and (iii) jurisdictions and insolvency practitioners; (b) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group; (c) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and (d) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice, _mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see_ 457 ----- “—Insolvency Test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any).

Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement or forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have agreed to take part in the proceedings usually decide not to do so for their duration.

They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (with the _conciliateur being able to request an extension in the event that the court first decided on less than five months)._ The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners that puts an end to its difficulties (for example, providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness). Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. _Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from_ taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor. Pursuant to article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace _periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment; the_ judge will take its decision after having heard the conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings. Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement. The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose which will have to be attended by the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be, if (i) the debtor is not insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the_ conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and in addition: - the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial Court, which should only disclose the amount of any New Money Lien and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the works 458 ----- council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court; - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to certain pre-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; - in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be written off and their payment date may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted, not even by the creditors’ committees (the powers of the bondholders’ general meeting in this respect are the subject of debate); - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; and - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency Test”), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below,—see “The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and _Liquidation Proceedings”), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval_ (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud). Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de _l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:_ - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded; - the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as explained above; and - a third party which had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted in the context of conciliation proceedings. If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors which is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard, is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, particularly through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (plan de cession) which could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the _conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, reorganization or liquidation_ proceedings after consultation with the state prosecutor. As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation 459 ----- of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisors retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, or invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is (except for small companies, for which the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) appointed to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court makes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate to its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the courtappointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_ representative or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings, (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) if no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, the bondholders’ general meeting (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases: (i) the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor and in all such cases with the exception of (i) (b), the court may act upon its own initiative; and (ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt forgiveness, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. 460 ----- _Standard consultation: This applies to debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or_ prepared by a chartered accountant; or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million or less. In such cases, the court appointed notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt remissions and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the maximum possible length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses operated by individuals where the maximum is fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de _sauvegarde) can impose on them a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals_ that were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses operated by individuals where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no waiver of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. _Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, whose accounts are certified by a statutory_ auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered accountant (expert-comptable) and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the court-appointed administrator’s request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not meet the aforementioned thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’ committees which are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to the judgment commencing the proceedings: - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor (the “credit institutions committee”); and - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court-appointed administrator (the “major suppliers’ committee”). If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities will be established (the “bondholders’ general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations. 461 ----- As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or general meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee or general meeting. The proposed plan: - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the proceedings; - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and - may, among other things, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of set off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where applicable). Creditors that are members of the credit institutions’ committee or of the major suppliers committee may also prepare alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the general bondholders’ meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders’ general meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan. The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote). Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders’ general meeting must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or partial payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The courtappointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors’ committees/bondholders’ general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the courtappointed administrator. The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan or take part in the vote. Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the bondholders’ general meeting at the same two-third’s majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders (see below), the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders’ general meeting within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it), this six-month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving 462 ----- access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the general bondholder meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire) or the state prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceeding into judicial reorganization_ proceeding if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the safeguard proceeding would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent. _Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: Public creditors (financial administrations, social_ security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens, mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible remissions within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). Tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As for indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast-track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those: - that publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; or - whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and have (i) more than 20 employees, (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million (excluding VAT) or (iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million. If the debtor does not exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors’ committee (see above), the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision. To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of conciliation proceedings; - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to overcome; and - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a maximum of two months following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions’ committee and bondholders’ general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until the adoption of a plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) 463 ----- apply, any amounts (including interest) relating to debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after their commencement if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committeebased consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde _accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and_ creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee, but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see “committee-based consultation”)), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process. The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below).",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above); de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have deliberately failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability in the event that judicial liquidation proceedings should be subsequently commenced against the debtor. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire), a controller, the State prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial_ reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed 464 ----- administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the State prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court may, at the request of the administrator, appoint a trustee (mandataire de _justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor_ of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business as described below. Any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) can present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholder meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. 465 ----- In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law to limit their duration. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes: - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de _cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on_ all or part of the debtor’s business; or - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only)); - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or - request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement this process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court adopts a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; - in the event where if there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), which runs from the insolvency date of the debtor until the date of the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. 466 ----- Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void while others are voidable by the court. - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of matured debts in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security granted for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité). - Transactions which are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration and administrative seizure measure (saisie administrative) notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time.

Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of_ continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its postcommencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “sale plan” (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once); in such a case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the plan for the sale of the business or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: (i) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); (ii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business); (iii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor; 467 ----- (iv) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly filed within one year of the expiration of the observation period; (v) creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (a) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (b) to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or (c) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, is located in another Member State in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation; and (vi) in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en _cours) will be required._ In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors who fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two- or four-month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the judicial administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proofs of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials, fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien 468 ----- (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Pursuant to French corporate benefit rules, French Guarantors must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuers, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantees. In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock 469 ----- company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered.

Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a precontractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

This new regime applies to security agents appointed after 1st October 2017. New Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security interests and personal guarantees for the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately from its own estate. As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties.

Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent _des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code._ 470 ----- The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, they will be provided for by the creation of “Parallel Debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indentures (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10 25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustees have certain assigned duties and rights under the Indentures that become particularly important following defaults or events of default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011_ n°10 25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of the Security Agent. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral.

To our knowledge, French courts have never expressly recognized the concept of second (or lower) ranking pledge in respect of a financial securities account and, if article 2340 of the French Civil Code does recognize the possibility to create multiple pledges in respect of the same tangible asset, this article is not expressly stated to apply to pledges over financial securities account. In addition, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second- or lower-ranking pledge thereon. The second- or lower-ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will therefore provide that the possession of the securities account is transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as tiers convenu (entiercement), that the first-ranking and second- or lower-ranking secured parties have consented to the creation of second- or lower-ranking pledge and that the first-ranking secured parties have accepted their appointment as tiers convenu and hold the pledged securities as custodian for the benefit of both the first-ranking and the second- or lower-ranking secured parties. This structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurance can be given that such second- or lower-ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second-, or lower-ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event. 472 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

With prior approval of the court, an administrator may also deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under English law there is the possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any security interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee does not have the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice because the description given to the charges in the relevant security document as fixed charges is not determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. If any fixed security interests are recharacterised as floating security interests: (i) the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings; and (ii) it is possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made in respect of such a company if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of three weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any 474 ----- distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on insolvency”). An administrator can also be appointed out-of-court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. During the administration of a company, a statutory moratorium is imposed and a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral arrangements) or guarantee granted by the company without the consent of the administrator or the court. The moratorium does not, however, apply to a “financial collateral agreement” (such as a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. Similar restrictions apply regarding the institution or continuation of legal process. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”), dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). In addition, in limited circumstances (as set forth in more detail below) a secured creditor can appoint an administrative receiver (see “—Administrative _Receivership”)._",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge.

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two latter proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following twelve months. The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) 475 ----- is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding up petition. Once a winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up – it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. As with a compulsory liquidation, this is important because it means secured creditors, for example, can go ahead and enforce their security. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. Onerous property, for these purposes, is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company which is unsalable or not readily salable or is such that it may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company which may be regarded as detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. This power does not apply to a contract all the obligations under which have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding-up, to sell the company’s property and to execute documents in the name of the company; and to challenge antecedent transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 1986, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the “prescribed part” (see “—Prescribed Part”), distributions cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Whereas the principle of pari passu distribution would dis-allow contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or an administrator issues notice of his/her intention to make a distribution of assets to creditors, it does not prevent the effect of mandatory insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation. This effectively affords the creditor with a potential super priority status, in that its loss (the amount owed to the insolvent company, if any) is automatically reduced. The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - first-ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets of the debtor; - second-ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting forth the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. 476 ----- Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and include: (a) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit; and (b) from April 6, 2020, claims by HMRC for taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax, employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employers’ NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - fourth-ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the prescribed part must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors (see “—Prescribed Part”); - fifth-ranking claims: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid; and - sixth-ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

The grant of a security interest or guarantee will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee or security must be granted within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in Section 240 of the Insolvency Act, as amended). A court will not generally make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value).

The grant of a security interest or guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the security interest or guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be made, the decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in Section 240 of the Insolvency Act, as amended) if the beneficiary of the security interest or the guarantee is not a connected person, or two years if the beneficiary is a connected person. A court will not make an order in respect of a preference of a person unless it is satisfied the company was influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to produce the “better position” for that person. Case law suggests there must be a desire to prefer one creditor over another and not just other commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of producing the better position.

Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Furthermore, corporate benefit must be established for each obligor that is incorporated in England and Wales by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he or she considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote success of the relevant obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction for which there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Under the Companies Act 2006, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including where not governed by English law) granted by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales (together with prescribed particulars of the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security document. Such security, if not registered within the 21 day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and a creditor of the applicable chargor. Furthermore, failure to register also means that the debt that was intended to be secured is deemed to have become immediately payable. In the event the relevant security document is not registered, a chargor incorporated in England and Wales may be required to enter into a new security document and register that with Companies House within 21 days of its creation. Alternatively, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify the position and allow the charge to be registered after the 21 day period has expired. This application can be made by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the security out of time if it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard as to whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. The court order will have to be enclosed with any delayed application for registration of the security. 480 ----- Security created on or after October 1, 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales do not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (although they may still need to be registered with the applicable asset registry). Guarantees and security granted by a guarantor or security provider a chargor who is incorporated in England and Wales are also subject to limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The floating charge will, however, be validated to the extent of the value of the consideration provided for the creation of the charge in the form of money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge plus interest payable on such amounts. Where the floating charge is granted to a connected person the charge can be challenged if given within two years of the onset of insolvency and the prerequisite to challenge that the company is unable to pay its debts does not apply.

In practice, any foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied by the English courts where, among other things, the company’s centre of main interests is in England, or the company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on a detailed debt restructuring compromise. Such restructuring compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the creditors’ meeting(s) in each relevant class vote in favor of the proposed restructuring compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, that restructuring compromise will be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement.

Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the Guarantors and Collateral providers would likely be based on English insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a company incorporated under English law has its “centre of main interests” in a Member State other than England and Wales, then the main insolvency proceedings for that company may be opened in the Member State in which its centre of main interests is located and be subject to the laws of that Member State. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. See “—European Union.” In addition, the United Kingdom Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign (i.e., non-English) court may have jurisdiction where any English company has its centre of main interests in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). To the extent that the United Kingdom Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 conflict with an obligation of the United Kingdom under the EU Insolvency Regulation, the requirements of the EU Insolvency Regulation will prevail. English insolvency law is different from the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar and it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) making an application for administration out-of-court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind-up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation). A company may be wound-up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes. Unsecured debts may also be subject to a company voluntary arrangement. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “Insolvency Act”), a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), or, among other matters, if it fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order). The obligations under certain of the Notes are secured by English law governed security interests over the Collateral and therefore English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the security interests over the Collateral that are governed by English law. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English company.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

A Dutch company has its registered office (statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands and it is therefore presumed that a Dutch company has its centre of main 481 ----- interests in the Netherlands. That means that in the event of insolvency of a Guarantor, insolvency proceedings with respect to those entities would likely be opened in the Netherlands and, as a result, be governed by Dutch insolvency law. Dutch insolvency laws are different from the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, and this may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. Under Dutch law, there are two insolvency proceedings that may be opened in respect of legal entities: suspension of payments (surseance van betaling) and bankruptcy (faillissement). The first, suspension of payments (or “moratorium”), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enables the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy, is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency proceedings are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of both insolvency proceedings is set out below. A moratorium is a court ordered general suspension of a debtor’s obligations to its creditors. A moratorium is available at the request of the debtor on the ground that the debtor foresees to be unable to continue payments when they fall due and could be used as a defense by the debtor against a bankruptcy application by a creditor. It may be ordered only by the district court located in the district in which the company has its statutory seat. Upon the filing of the request for a moratorium, the court will immediately (dadelijk) grant the moratorium on a provisional basis and appoint at least one administrator (bewindvoerder) of the debtor’s estate. Subsequently, a court hearing of among others the unsecured non-preferential creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. The court will then decide whether to grant a definitive moratorium or, alternatively, the court may declare the debtor bankrupt. The court will grant a definitive moratorium unless such moratorium is opposed by either (i) creditors having claims jointly exceeding one quarter of the total amount of claims represented at the meeting or (ii) more than one third in number of creditors whose claims are represented at the meeting. The moratorium is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. A moratorium takes effect retroactively until midnight on the day on which the court has granted the provisional moratorium. Bankruptcy is a court ordered general attachment of the assets of a debtor for the benefit of the debtor’s collective creditors. The purpose of bankruptcy is to provide for a liquidation and distribution of the proceeds of the debtor’s assets among its creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. Bankruptcy may be ordered only by the district court located in the district in which the company has its statutory seat. An application for bankruptcy can be made by either (i) one or more creditors of the debtor, (ii) the public prosecutor (if the public interest so requires) or (iii) the debtor itself, on the grounds that the debtor has ceased paying its debts. A debtor is considered to have ceased paying its debts if it has more than one creditor and if at least one of its payment obligations is due but unpaid. As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. Furthermore, all pending executions of judgments and any attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as further described below) will be terminated by operation of law, and any pending litigation on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically suspended. A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively until midnight on the day the order is rendered. In the event of bankruptcy, a court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy (curator) at its own discretion, which, in most cases, will be a practicing lawyer in the Netherlands. The receiver in bankruptcy manages the bankrupt estate, which consists of all of the debtor’s assets and liabilities that exist on the date on which the bankruptcy was opened, and of all assets acquired during the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate is not liable for obligations incurred by the debtor after the bankruptcy order, except to the extent that such obligations arise from transactions that are beneficial to the estate. A receiver in bankruptcy operates under the supervision of a supervisory judge (rechter_commissaris) designated by the court, and thus most of a receiver in bankruptcy’s major decisions require the prior approval of the supervisory judge. There is no legal duty for a debtor or its managing board to file for bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a moratorium as described above. 482 ----- Secured creditors can exercise their rights during the bankruptcy or a moratorium as normal. However, the bankruptcy judge may call a “freeze order” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months (consisting of an initial two months, with a possible two month extension), during which period the secured creditors cannot exercise their rights unless such creditors have obtained a leave for enforcement from the bankruptcy judge. The receiver in bankruptcy can force secured creditors to enforce their security rights within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver in bankruptcy will be entitled to sell the secured assets and distribute the proceeds. The receiver in bankruptcy is authorized to make such forced sales in order to prevent a secured creditor from delaying the enforcement of the security without good reason. If a receiver in bankruptcy does make a forced sale of secured assets, the secured creditors have to contribute to the general bankruptcy expenses (algemene faillissementskosten) and will receive payment from the proceeds of that sale prior to ordinary, non-preferred creditors having an insolvency claim, but after creditors of the estate (boedelschuldeisers), and subject to satisfaction of higher ranking claims of creditors. Dutch tax authorities (belastingdienst) have a preferential claim in respect of the collection of certain taxes (for example, social security premiums, wage tax, value added tax, etc.) on certain movable property found on the debtor’s premises (bodemvoorrecht). They may take recourse against such property irrespective of whether any security interests over such property exist. Excess proceeds of enforcement of security rights must be returned to the debtor in bankruptcy and may not be set off against any unsecured claims that the secured creditors may have. Such set off is, in principle, only allowed outside bankruptcy of the debtor. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims need to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy makes a preliminary determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. Creditors that wish to dispute the verification of their claims by the receiver in bankruptcy will be referred to the claim validation proceedings (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim. Interest accruing after the date of the bankruptcy order cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage. In that event, interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy. A Dutch pledge can serve as security for monetary claims (geldvorderingen) only and can only be enforced upon default (verzuim) of the obligations secured thereby. Foreclosure on pledged property is to be carried out in accordance with the applicable provisions and limitations of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering).",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the Security Documents pursuant to which a security interest under Dutch law will be granted use a parallel debt structure, whereby the Dutch subsidiaries, as separate and independent obligations, undertake to pay to the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes offered hereby amounts equal to the amounts due by it to the holders of the notes. Such parallel debt structure therefore creates a separate and independent claim of the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes offered hereby which can be secured by a security interest. Consequently, the security interests are granted to the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes offered hereby in its own capacity as creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel debt, and not as a representative (vertegenwoordiger) of the creditors. It is expressly agreed in such a parallel debt provision that the obligations of the debtor to the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes offered hereby shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the creditors are reduced (and vice versa). However, such a parallel debt structure has never been tested before a Dutch court and we cannot assure that it will mitigate or eliminate the risk of unenforceability posed by Dutch law. Under Dutch law, receipt of any payment made by any Dutch Guarantor under a guarantee or security interest may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such guarantee or security interest. The validity and enforceability of a guarantee of, or a security interest granted by or in, any Dutch Guarantors may also be successfully contested by any Dutch Guarantors (or their receiver in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim, as further described below. The validity and enforceability of the obligations of our Dutch subsidiaries 483 ----- under a guarantee or security interest may also be successfully contested by any creditor, or by the subsidiaries’ respective receiver in bankruptcy when the subsidiary is in bankruptcy proceedings, if such obligation is prejudicial to the interests of any other creditor and the other requirements for voidable preference under the Dutch Civil Code and Dutch Bankruptcy Act are met, as further described below. As a result, the value of the guarantee and security interests provided by the Dutch Guarantors may be limited. In the context of inquiry proceedings, a corporate resolution approving the issuance of a guarantee by the Dutch company or a security to be provided by the Dutch company may be suspended or voided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeals in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof _Amsterdam) on the motion of inter alia one or more holders of shares or depository receipts issued for shares in_ such company who, solely or jointly, represent at least one tenth of the issued capital or who are entitled to an amount of in shares or depository receipts issued therefore with a nominal value of €225,000 or such lesser amount as is provided by the articles of association (statuten) of the relevant company, and persons who are authorized to do so by the articles of association or under an agreement with such company. The right to file such motion is further vested in an association of employees which has amongst its members person working for the enterprise and which has at least two years full legal capacity, and, for reasons of public interest, the advocate general at the Court of Appeals in Amsterdam. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or voided. Pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or a security document governed by Dutch law may be withheld under doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure (niet _toerekenbare tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden) and other defenses_ afforded by Dutch law to obligors generally. Other general defenses include claims that a guarantee or security interest should be avoided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Furthermore, under Dutch law, a party to an agreement may under certain circumstances suspend performance of its obligations under such agreement pursuant to the _exceptio non-adimpleti contractus or otherwise._ Pursuant to Article 2:7 of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek), any transaction entered into by a legal entity may be nullified by the legal entity itself or its receiver in bankruptcy (curator) if the objects of that entity were transgressed by the transaction and the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this without independent investigation (wist of zonder eigen onderzoek moest weten). The Dutch Supreme Court (Hoge Raad der Nederlanden) has ruled that in determining whether the objects of a legal entity are transgressed, not only the description of the objects in that legal entity’s articles of association (statuten) is decisive, but all (relevant) circumstances must be taken into account, in particular whether the transaction is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit; and whether the subsistence of the company is jeopardized by the transaction. Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of bankruptcy, the so called actio pauliana provisions. The actio pauliana offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitations, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the receiver in bankruptcy in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (om niet) in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of fraudulent conveyance. In addition, in the case of a bankruptcy, the receiver in bankruptcy may nullify the performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die betaling ontving) knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of payment or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and the payee with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code vary and provide a debtor with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other things, contains terms or provisions relating to: (a) the administration of a bankruptcy case, including the provision of “adequate protection” to secured creditors, the automatic stay, terms for the use, sale or lease of property, standards for obtaining credit and the treatment of executory contracts and leases; (b) creditors and claims, including filing proofs of claim, priority and allowance of claims, rights of creditors and subordination of claims; (c) provisions relating to the creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the estate and turnover and avoidance actions; liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; and ancillary and cross-border insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the debtor’s assets by a trustee, and typically, a chapter 7 case results in the immediate shutdown of the debtor’s business. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to rehabilitate their businesses and work out their obligations to creditors. Unlike in chapter 7, the debtor in a chapter 11 case typically remains in control of its assets and continues to operate its business during the course of the bankruptcy case. In addition, “liquidating” chapter 11 cases may be utilized as an alternative to chapter 7 liquidations, especially where the conversion of a pending chapter 11 case to a case under chapter 7 might prove prohibitively expensive or in an instance when a debtor expects to sell all or substantially all of its assets. Because bankruptcy proceedings tend to be fact-specific and vary case-by-case and because U.S. bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all of the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that could impact the Notes, the Collateral or the Guarantees is not contained herein. Furthermore, the common law applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this summary is not intended to cover the common law that may apply in any particular jurisdiction. With respect to proceedings under any applicable state insolvency laws (for example, assignments for the benefit of creditors, receiverships or other state liquidation mechanisms) and the application of state laws in bankruptcy proceedings, the effects and customs of these proceedings are fact-specific, vary from state to state and require an examination of both statutory and common law, the details of which also are not described herein. 485 ----- To the extent more information is required, potential investors in the Notes should consult an insolvency professional familiar with U.S. and the applicable state insolvency laws.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Aspects of federal bankruptcy laws or general principles of equity that could result in the impairment of rights include, but are not limited to: - the automatic stay; - avoidance of preferential transfers by a trustee or debtor-in-possession; - substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of multiple entities; - limitations on collectability of unmatured interest or attorney fees; - fraudulent transfer; and - forced restructuring of the debt issued by the bankrupt company, including reduction of principal amounts and interest rates and extension of maturity dates, or the conversion of debt to equity interests, other forms of consideration (such as interests in a trust), or potential discharge of all obligations without significant recovery, over the creditors’ objections. As an initial matter, the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code operates as a stay, applicable to all creditors, of most litigation against the debtor and efforts to collect prepetition claims, enforce existing liens or impose most new liens. The stay applies to the debtor and its assets globally. The purpose of the stay is to provide the chapter 11 debtor time to reorganize and the chapter 7 trustee protection under which to liquidate in an orderly fashion the debtor’s assets for the benefit of creditors. The automatic stay is also intended to shield a debtor from the pressures of creditor collection efforts. Among other things, the automatic stay prohibits (a) all collection efforts by creditors, (b) the enforcement of prepetition judgments against the debtor or property of the estate, (c) any act to create, perfect or enforce a lien against property of the estate and (d) the set off of prepetition debts owing to the debtor against debts owing by the debtor. The automatic stay ordinarily does not bar suits against non-debtor guarantors or co-obligors, nor does it enjoin payment under a letter of credit issued by a bank in favor of a creditor of the applicable debtor. Applicable federal bankruptcy laws generally do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorney’s fees for unsecured or “undersecured” claims.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a U.S. Provider would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than all of its assets, at a fair valuation; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. 486 ----- However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency determinations, and different courts may reach different conclusions with regard to these issues. In an evidentiary ruling in the In re W.R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy case, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware held that under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, whether a transferor is rendered insolvent by a transfer depends on the actual liabilities of the transferor, and not what the transferor knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer. Therefore, under that court’s analysis, liabilities that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully appreciated at the time of the transfer, may be taken into account in the context of a future determination of insolvency. If the principle articulated by that court is applied, it would make it very difficult to know whether a transferor is solvent at the time of transfer, and would increase the risk that a transfer may in the future be found to be a fraudulent transfer. By their terms, the Guarantees of each U.S. Provider will limit the liability of each such guarantor to the maximum amount it can pay without the Guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer. It is not assured, however, that this limitation will protect such Guarantee from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the Guarantee would suffice, if necessary, to pay the Notes in full when due.

458_2,Offerings 2020.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.4,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES France,25.4.1,,"The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Notes against French entities and/or French individuals. The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (tribunaux judiciaires) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law as of the date of this offering memorandum, do not include a review by a French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res _judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in_ France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French Law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French Law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French data protection rules (Law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified) most recently by laws No. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 and No. 2018-699 of August 3, 2018, French Ordinance No. 2018-1125 of December 12, 2018 and the EU General Data Protection Regulation can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. 494 ----- Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code (Code civil), a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive their rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, with respect to legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against to a person domiciled in a Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the European Union. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.5,England and Wales,25.5.1,,"The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law; - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court that pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English or other non-U.S. court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties and/or prior inconsistent 495 ----- judgment given in a Hague Convention Member State of the European Union or a member state of the EEA which the English court must recognize and enforce under the Hague Convention Choice of Court Agreements of June 30, 2005 and/or Council Regulation (EC) 1215/2012 and/or the Lugano Conventions of 1988 and 2007; - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the United States; - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S. judgment. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In particular, a judgement given by a U.S. federal or state court may not be enforced by the courts of England and Wales if such judgement: - is subject to a pending or proposal appeal; - cannot be enforced in the state in which the judgement was given; or - was made in proceedings, the bringing of which was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in the courts of that country, unless such proceedings were brought by or with the agreement of the person against where the judgement was given or that person submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Furthermore, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.6,The Netherlands,25.6.1,,"The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain United States court judgments in the Netherlands is based upon advice provided to us by our Dutch legal advisors. The Dutch Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law and have their registered seat in the Netherlands. A substantial amount of the assets of the Dutch Guarantors’ directors are located outside of the United States. It is uncertain whether a Dutch court will accept jurisdiction and impose civil or other liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. This court will have the discretion to attach such weight to the judgment rendered by the relevant U.S. court as it deems appropriate. Based on case law, the Dutch courts can be expected to adjudicate substantial importance to a final, conclusive and enforceable judgment as to monetary obligations rendered by a U.S. federal or state court of competent jurisdiction, without full re-examination or full re-litigation of the substantive matters adjudicated upon (marginale toetsing), provided that (a) that judgment results from proceedings compatible with the Dutch concept of due process (behoorlijke _rechtspleging), (b) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (c) the_ jurisdiction of the court has been based on an internationally acceptable ground, (d) the judgment by the court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands and (e) that judgment is, according to the law of its country of origin, formally capable of being enforced (it is readily enforceable, has not been annulled in appeal or its enforceability has not been subject to a certain time frame). 496 ----- Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Dutch civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. Insofar as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trail discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No similar pre-trial discovery process exists under Dutch law. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. 497 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

NOTES TO INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1370.2,"New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the group from January 1, 2019",1370.2.1,,"_- “IFRS 16 – Leases”, which was issued by the IASB on January 13th, 2016 and registered by the European Commission on October 31[st], 2017._ The Group applies for the first time IFRS 16 – Leases on January 1, 2019. As required by IAS 34, the nature and effect of these changes are disclosed below. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet mode which is substantially unchanged from IAS 17. Contracts committed by Banijay for which this accounting standard applies, are mainly, real-estate leases. Banijay is a tenant of the offices in most cities where the group operates. At inception of a lease contract, the group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Rights-of-use of leases are being amortized over the contracts duration. As a consequence, lease expenses have been restated from external expenses while higher financial interests and depreciation and amortization have been recognized. Banijay Group adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. The group used the transition practical expedient allowing the standard to be applied only to contracts that were previously identified as leases applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 at the date of initial application. The transition method used consists in recognizing the cumulative effect of the initial application as an adjustment on opening equity (on January 1, 2019), by considering the right-of-use of the underlying asset is equal to the amount of the lease liability. The comparative information for each of the primary financial statements (related to 2018) have not been restated and have been presented based on the requirements of previous standards (i.e. IAS 17 Leases). Banijay Group has elected to use the exemptions proposed by the standard on lease contracts for which: - the lease terms end within 12 months as of the date of initial application and containing no purchase options, - and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value (such as certain office equipment: personal computers, printing and photocopying machines). Given their low materiality in consolidated financial statements, vehicles will not be dealt under IFRS 16 either and will be assimilated to low value assets. Therefore, at transition date, the sole real estate leases have been restated. At 1[st] January 2019, the impact of IFRS 16 adoption is an increase of €68.4 m of both right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, with therefore no impact in the net equity. They are detailed Note 5.4 “Impacts of IFRS 16 first application”.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,1370,5. NOTES TO INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1370.3,Summary of new accounting policies,1370.3.1,,"Set out below are the new accounting policies of the group upon adoption of IFRS 16, which have been applied from the date of initial application: _Right-of-use assets_ The group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to F-16 ----- obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. _Lease liabilities_ At the commencement date of the lease, the group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The interest used at the inception of the contract will be the same for the whole life of the lease term aside if there are modifications in contract terms such as a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. _Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_ The group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered of low value. Given their low materiality in consolidated financial statements, vehicles are not dealt under IFRS 16 either and are assimilated to low value assets. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. _Significant judgement in determining the lease term of contacts with renewal options_ The group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The group has the option, under some of its real estate leases to lease the assets for additional terms of several years. The group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g., a change in business strategy). - “IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over income tax treatment”, which was issued by the IASB on June 7[th], 2017 and _registered by the European Commission on October 23rd, 2018._ IFRIC 23 clarifies the application of the provisions set out in IAS 12 – Income Taxes in terms of recognition and measurement when there are uncertainties over income tax treatments: - Professional judgement should be used to determine whether each tax treatment should be considered independently or whether some tax treatments should be considered together; - The most likely amount or the expected value of the tax treatment should be used for accounting purposes. No significant impact has been considered. - Other amendments F-17 ----- Other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2019, but do not have an impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements of the group and are listed below: - Amendments to IFRS 9 - Amendments to IFRS 3 business combination - Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes - Amendments to IAS 23 borrowing costs",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Main estimates and accounting assumptions,1370.5.1,,"The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements of the group requires the management to use certain estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the carrying amount of revenues, costs, assets and liabilities. The main estimates and assumptions relate (i) to the valuation and useful lives of audiovisual rights, (ii) to the valuation of goodwill, (iii) to the amount of provisions for risks and other provisions in relation with the group’s activity, (iv) to the calculation of debt related to earn outs on acquisitions, (v) to the estimate of debt resulting from put options in favour of minority shareholders, and (vi) to the assumptions used for share-based payments. The features of main accounting methods, judgements and other uncertainties which affect the application of these accounting methods, as well as the sensitivity of the results to changes in the conditions and assumptions, are factors to be taken into account while reading these financial statements, as the outcomes of these estimations will, by definition, rarely equal the actual figures. There has been no significant change in the main estimates and accounting assumptions of the group over the period. _Goodwill impairment_ The group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if goodwill has to be impaired. This requires the recoverable value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated, to be measured. The group mainly estimates the recoverable value through its value-in-use. The latter is determined by the management through a projection of expected future cash flows that are discounted at an appropriate rate. No trigger event that would require an impairment test to be performed has been identified at the date of issuance of those condensed consolidated financial statements. _Content assets depreciation_ The group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if the content assets presented in the balance sheet have to be impaired. The carrying value of these assets is compared to the net sales forecast of the said format over a maximum period of 10 years. No trigger event that would require an impairment test to be performed has been identified at the date of issuance of those condensed consolidated financial statements. _Earn-out payments / put option rights in favour of minority shareholders_ Following external growth transactions, the group can be committed to pay former/minority shareholders either earn-outs or further acquisition price pursuant to put options on their remaining shareholding, depending on future profits. Related debts are accounted for in the balance sheet at their present value. The group estimates these debts using assumptions on future profits and calculates scheduled cash outflows using a discount rate. _Share-based payments_ Share subscription, purchase options, phantom shares as well as free shares have been granted to certain employees of the group. These plans depend on the assumptions on future profits of the group. F-18 ----- In 2017, the Board of the Shareholders approved incentive agreements with certain key employees (which consist in phantom shares and free shares depending on the employee). The value of these plans depends on future profits of the relevant subsidiaries as well as on the equity value of the group. These plans have been valuated based on a fair value approach whose parameters are the expected value creation of the group and of the subsidiaries, volatility of the sector and an appropriate discount rate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Operating leases commitment disclosed at the end of December 2018 (note 5.10) amounted to €69.2m to compare with €68.4m of lease liability. Difference is mainly due to: - Discounting effect with IFRS 16 with a weighted average rate of c. 2,4%, no discounting for operating leases commitment under IAS 17 - Retained duration of the lease commitment: expected duration for IFRS 16 vs firm commitment with IAS 17 - some contracts fall under the exemptions allowed by the IFRS 16 standard (low value or short term contracts) although disclosed under IAS 17. IFRS 16 lease liability corresponds to the discounted value of future payments, although lease commitments are firm payments not discounted. Also, due to specific features of some leases (particularly regarding renewal arrangements), the timeframes used to measure leases under IFRS 16 could in some cases differ from those used to measure off-balance sheet commitments in which only the firm commitment period is taken into account.

As of September 30[th], 2019, Banijay Group recognizes three main operating segments: - Production activity, which encompasses all production entities of the group. These entities form a single operating segment as the nature of their business is similar across the group (mainly ‘the production of audiovisual contents’) and they present similar long-term economic characteristics. - Distribution activity, constituted by Banijay Rights and its subsidiaries, whose activity differs from the rest of the group as those entities are in charge of selling finished tapes and formats. - ‘Others’ segment is mainly composed of holdings, Kids activities and certain specific operating activities (notably Digital & TV Channel).",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Objectives and strategies regarding financial risk management,"The main financial instruments of the group include bank borrowings (including a €35m multi-currency revolving credit facility not drawn as of September 30[th], 2019) and bank overdrafts. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide the group with the financial means necessary for its activities. The group has various financial assets, such as trade receivables, cash and short-term deposits, which are directly generated by its operations. The group’s strategy was, and remains, not to do any trading on derivative instruments. The main risks resulting from the financial instruments of the group involve liquidity risk, interest rate risk, exchange risk and credit risk. The risks of the entities of the group are managed by each entity according to the group’s strategy and in accordance with the Company’s instructions. _Liquidity risk_ The group maintains adequate reserves of cash and short-term deposits to satisfy its liquidity needs. Besides, since 2013, the group treasury department implemented several liquidity concentration pools around the main business regions (Europe, US, UK & Scandinavia). Over the period, approximately 81% of group’s revenue is covered by such mechanisms. Therefore, the organic growth of the group, its working capital needs as well as its financing commitments (including payment of earn-out debts or put option debts) are notably ensured by operating cash flows generated by the business units. As part of the refinancing, Banijay Group is subject to financial covenants. As of September 2019, all ratios impacting the group’s short-term liquidity are satisfied. _Interest rate risk_ The exposure of the group to the risk of interest rate fluctuations is mainly related to the c. €60m senior facilities agreement which has been drawn in GB pounds sterling and is dependent on LIBOR short-term interest rate. Considering the relatively stable level of LIBOR over the recent period, Brexit event and low proportion of such facilities in Banijay’s total external debts, the group regards its interest rate risk as remote. _Foreign currency risk_ The foreign subsidiaries of the group operate essentially on their own territory and sales or purchases within the group are not significant; as a result, the transactional foreign exchange risk is limited. For the group, the main currency risk is a translational foreign exchange risk, mostly linked to USD and GBP: - As of September 30[th], 2019, the percentage of sales carried out in US dollars represented 16.3% of the consolidated turnover. A decrease of 5% (resp. an increase of 5%) of the US dollar foreign exchange rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue of €(4.9) million (resp. €5.5 million). F-33 ----- - As of September 30[th], 2019, the percentage of sales carried out in GB pounds represented 10.7% of the consolidated turnover. A decrease of 5% (resp. an increase of 5%) of the GB pounds sterling foreign exchange rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue of €(3.3) million (resp. €3.6 million). _Credit risk_ Credit risk occurs if a party to a transaction is unable or refuses to fulfil its obligations, causing a financial loss to the group. The group deals only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. Receivables are monitored regularly, so that the group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Contracts committed by Banijay for which this accounting standard applies, are: - mainly, real-estate leases: Banijay is a tenant of the offices in most cities where the Group operates; - and to a lesser extent, of vehicles and IT hardware leases. Banijay Group will apply the modified retrospective approach at transition date (1 January 2019). At inception of the lease a financial liability and a fixed asset will be recognized for the present value of the cash outflows. As a consequence, lease expenses will be restated from external expenses while higher financial interests and depreciation and amortization will be recognized. Banijay Group will elect to use the exemptions proposed by the standard on lease contracts for which: - the lease terms end within 12 months as of the date of initial application, - and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value (Such as certain office equipment: personal computers, printing and photocopying machines). Given their low materiality in consolidated financial statements, vehicles will not be dealt under IFRS 16 either. Therefore, at transition date, the sole real estate leases will be restated. At 1[st] January 2019, the estimated provisional impact of IFRS 16 adoption is expected to be, an increase of approximately €70 M of both Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, compared with €69.2 M in lease commitments (see note § 5.10). IFRS 16 lease liability corresponds to the discounted value of future payments, although lease commitments are firm payment not discounted. Also, because of the specific features of some leases (particularly regarding renewal arrangements), the timeframes used to measure leases under IFRS 16 could in some cases differ from those used to measure off-balance sheet commitments in which only the firm commitment period is taken into account. - _“IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over income tax treatment”, which was issued by the IASB on June 7[th], 2017 _and registered by the European Commission on October 23rd, 2018._ F-52 ----- IFRIC 23 clarifies the application of the provisions set out in IAS 12 – Income Taxes in terms of recognition and measurement when there are uncertainties over income tax treatments: - Professional judgement should be used to determine whether each tax treatment should be considered independently or whether some tax treatments should be considered together; - The most likely amount or the expected value of the tax treatment should be used for accounting purposes. No impact is expected.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

This first application of IFRS 15 does not have any impact in terms of timing or measurement of revenue. Production revenue is still recognized based on the episodic delivery method. Sale of finished tapes is still recognized when the license period to exploit the tapes starts. The only impact for the group relates to contracts which include a significant financing component for which the revenue should be discounted at revenue recognition date to reflect the credit facility granted to the customer. The group performs the assessment of significance of the significant financing component at an individual contract level. The assessment leads to conclude that the financing component does not have any material impact on Banijay Group’s Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, Consolidated Statement of Financial Position or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Banijay Group elected to the modified retrospective method (with cumulative effect method) to transition towards IFRS 15 with immaterial impacts on the group’s result and no impact on the opening equity. - _“IFRS 9 – Financial instruments” which was issued by the IASB on July 24, 2014 and registered by the _European Commission on November 29, 2016._ The new standard on financial instruments introduces new rules relating to the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, the impairment of financial assets, and the recognition of hedging transactions. This new standard does not have material impact on Banijay Group’s Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, Consolidated Statement of Financial Position or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows going forward. Regarding the classification of financial assets, the group now applies a single classification approach for all financial assets (amortised cost or fair value). The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on two criteria: the Group’s economic model for managing financial assets and whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9 did not have significant impact on the Group. In practice, trade receivables are still measured at the amortized cost method even though they may be sold in the context of, for example, factoring. The Group has not designated any financial liabilities as at fair value through profit and loss. There are no changes in classification and measurement for the Group’s financial liabilities. Concerning the implementation of the new phase “Impairment of financial assets” which replaces the IAS 39 “incurred losses” model with the “expected credit losses” model, it did not have any impact for the Group at F-51 ----- January 1, 2018. As the group deals with recognized and creditworthy third parties, its exposure to credit risk is limited. This model applies to operating and financial receivables as well as certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts This new standard does not have material impact on Banijay Group’s Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, Consolidated Statement of Financial Position or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows going forward. Apart from this, the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,1374,5.** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1374.3,5.3.2. Main estimates and accounting assumptions,1374.3.1,,"The preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the group requires the management to use certain estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the carrying amount of revenues, costs, assets and liabilities. The main estimates and assumptions relate (i) to the valuation and useful lives of audiovisual rights, (ii) to the valuation of goodwill, (iii) to the amount of provisions for risks and other provisions in relation with the group’s activity, (iv) to the calculation of debt related to earn outs on acquisitions, (v) to the estimate of debt resulting from put options in favour of minority shareholders, and (vi) to the assumptions used for share-based payments. The features of main accounting methods, judgements and other uncertainties which affect the application of these accounting methods, as well as the sensitivity of the results to changes in the conditions and assumptions, are factors to be taken into account while reading these financial statements, as the outcomes of these estimations will, by definition, rarely equal the actual figures. There has been no significant change in the main estimates and accounting assumptions of the group over the period. _Goodwill impairment_ The group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if goodwill has to be impaired. This requires the recoverable value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated, to be measured. The group mainly estimates the recoverable value through its value-in-use. The latter is determined by the management through a projection of expected future cash flows that are discounted at an appropriate rate. _Content assets depreciation_ The group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if the content assets presented in the balance sheet have to be impaired. The carrying value of these assets is compared to the net sales forecast of the said format over a maximum period of 10 years. _Earn-out payments / put option rights in favour of minority shareholders_ Following external growth transactions, the group can be committed to pay former/minority shareholders either earn-outs or further acquisition price pursuant to put options on their remaining shareholding, depending on future profits. Related debts are accounted for in the balance sheet at their present value.The group estimates these debts using assumptions on future profits and calculates scheduled cash outflows using a discount rate. _Share-based payments_ Share subscription, purchase options, phantom shares as well as free shares have been granted to certain employees of the group. These plans depend on the assumptions on future profits of the group. In 2017, the Board of the Shareholders approved new incentive agreements with certain key employees (which consist in phantom shares and free shares depending on the employee). The value of these plans depends on future profits of the relevant subsidiaries as well as on the equity value of the group. These plans have been valuated based on a fair value approach whose parameters are the expected value creation of the group and of the subsidiaries, volatility of the sector and an appropriate discount rate.

Summary of key accounting methods,1374.4.2,Consolidation scope and methods,"_Subsidiaries_ In accordance with IFRS 10, the subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date when the group acquires the control over the subsidiary. Under this standard, the group controls a subsidiary if and only if all the conditions below are met: - Having power over the investee, i.e. the group has existing rights that gives it the ability to direct the relevant activities (the activities that significantly affect the subsidiary’s returns) - Having exposure, or rights, to variable returns from the involvement with the subsidiary - Having the ability to use its power over the subsidiary to affect the amount of the group’s returns. When minority shares are subject to put and call options that give Banijay Group a present ownership on the underlying shares, no non-controlling interest are recognised in Banijay Group’s consolidated financial statements related to those minority shares. The group recognises a financial liability corresponding to the expected present value of the debt that will be paid to the holders following the exercise of those put and call options. _Joint ventures and associates_ Joint ventures are the companies in which the Company exercises a joint control. Associates are investments in which the Company exercises a significant influence, i.e. it has the power to participate in the financial and operational decisions but does not have control. The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures and associates using the equity method. Under this method, interests in associates and joint ventures are recorded in the balance sheet at acquisition cost and are increased or reduced by the group’s share in the entity’s net assets, post-acquisition. Goodwill relating to acquired associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment andis not depreciated. The statement of profit or loss reflects the group’s part in the results of operations of the related entity. Significant profits and losses resulting from transactions between the group and the associates and joint ventures are eliminated up to the percentage of interest in the entity. The percentage of legal interest held by the group in the consolidated companies as well as the consolidation methods are disclosed in Note 5.15 ‘Consolidation scope’.

The items of each entity’s financial statements are measured using the functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded initially at the exchange rate of the functional currency prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedging rate, if applicable. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate of the functional currency at the closing date and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are reported using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the initial transactions. Long-term monetary assets held by an entity of the group in a foreign subsidiary for which a settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, are a part of the net foreign investments. Thus, pursuant to the provisions of lAS 21 “The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates”, corresponding exchange rate differences are entered into “other comprehensive income” until the date the investment is disposed of. Otherwise, the exchange differences are recorded as profit or loss. Likewise, gains or losses exchange differences relating to intercompany loans that are hedging instruments for net investments abroad, as provided for by IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments “ are recognised as OCI. _Translation of subsidiaries’ foreign-currency denominated financial statements_ Assets and liabilities, including goodwill of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euro at the official exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date and their statement of profit or loss is translated at the average exchange rate over the period considered.

If applicable, the recoverable amount of the asset is tested for impairment to determine whether there is an impairment loss. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, this test is performed at least once a year. If appropriate, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the net book value of the asset exceeding the recoverable amount (mostly measured through the asset’s value-in-use). The recoverable value of the assets to which it is possible to directly attribute independent cash inflows is assessed on a stand-alone basis. The other assets are grouped within the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which they belong in order to estimate their value-in-use. A CGU is defined as the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Since the acquisition of Zodiak Media in 2016, the goodwill allocated to the different CGUs have been determined according to the territories and taking into consideration the similarities between the different markets. Currently, Banijay Group management considers 5 CGUs. The value-in-use of an asset or a CGU is measured by the method of discounted cash flows, based on projections of future financial cash flows over the next 4 years. Forecasts are derived from plans presented and approved by the Chairman and the Supervisory Board of the Company, with a projection to infinity using a growth rate. By assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted; the discount rate is a post-tax rate and reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Where an impairment loss is recognised, it is accounted for directly in the statement of profit or loss under a specific heading. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill can never be reversed. The value of assets, other than goodwill, for which an impairment loss has been recorded, is reviewed at each closing date for the purposes of reversing the impairment loss, if necessary. Where a reversal occurs, it is F-56 ----- recorded as profit or loss. In such a case, the book value of the asset can be increased up to its recoverable value.

The subsequent measurement of financial assets corresponds, depending on their nature, either to fair value (profit or loss or other comprehensive income) or to amortized cost. The classification of a financial asset in each of these categories depends on the management model applied by the enterprise and the characteristics of its contractual cash flows. Transactions relating to financial assets are recorded at settlement date. _Debt instrument at amortised costs_ These financial assets are initially recognised at their fair value to which is added directly attributable transaction costs and, then at amortised cost at each closing date, applying the effective interest rate method. This category of assets includes trade receivables and other debtors, loans and deposits, receivables attached to participating interests, cash and loans to associates or non-consolidated entities. _Equity instrument at fair value through OCI_ The Group elected to classify irrevocably its non-listed equity investments under this category as it intends to hold these investments for the foreseeable future. There were no impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for these investments in prior periods. _Impairment testing of debtor financial assets_ The group reviews if, at the closing date, a debtor financial asset or a Group of debt financial assets is likely to suffer an impairment loss based on both the expected credit loss approach and when there is an objective indicator of loss. In practice, given the weak level of loss incurred on prior years receivables, the expected credit loss approach does not have any significant impact. If there is an objective evidence that debtor financial assets carried at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI should be impaired, the amount of the loss is estimated by difference between the book value and the discounted future cash flows such as expected (excluding future probable and not actual credit losses). The discount rate used is the initial effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of the asset). The book value is reduced through the use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recorded as profit or loss. If, subsequently, the impairment decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment will be reversed. The reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as profit or loss, as long as the book value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the date the loss allowance is reversed. With respect to receivables, a loss allowance is recorded when there is objective evidence (probability of insolvency or severe financial difficulties of the debtor) that the group will be unable to recover the balance in accordance with the initial payment conditions. The book value of the receivable is reduced by way of an allowance for loss. Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are considered as uncollectible. F-57 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Summary of key accounting methods,1374.4.13,Derivative financial instruments,"The group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts, options and interest rate swaps to cover its risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. These derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the date on which they are contracted. They are then re-estimated at their fair value at each closing date. Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets in the balance sheet when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. For derivatives that meet the criteria of hedge accounting, gains or losses related to change in the fair value of derivatives during the financial year are accounted for in “other comprehensive income” in case of cash flow hedge or through P&L in case of Fair Value hedge. For derivatives that do not meet the hedging conditions, they are recognised directly as profit or loss. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to the forward exchange rates applicable to contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to the market values of similar instruments. The fair value of financial instruments that are traded on active markets is determined at each closing date by reference to the market quotations or transaction prices.

Baniiay recognizes revenue when it has satisfied a performance obligation by providing the customer with the promised good or service. A performance obligation is satisfied when control of the good or service is transferred to the customer. This transfer takes place at a point in time. Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably estimated. Revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of rebates, and net of consideration payable to a customer (pay-backs). If a contract includes a significant financing component, the revenue is discounted at revenue recognition date to reflect the credit facility granted to the customer. _Production revenues (from producing television programs)_ Production revenues are recognized when the programs are delivered to the client. Standard criteria to establish revenue recognition are: - in most cases: client’s acceptance document (i.e. delivery notice signed / approved by the client, …) - delivery of a certain number of episodes - expiry of the period stated in the contract to reject or return the product In case of partial delivery of the same program over several periods of time (series, etc...), revenue, costs and margin are recognized according to episodic deliveries.

At revenue recognition date, the production costs of non-scripted programs are expensed in the income statement. The production costs of scripted programs for which the group retains the IP are amortized as production costs in the statement of profit or loss using the ultimate revenue method. The cumulated amortization is calculated at the end of a given year as follows: Production costs x (actual cumulated revenue / total estimated revenue of program). The total estimated revenue of a program is the sum of actual cumulated revenue of the program and the program’s future revenue forecast. Depreciation for a current year is calculated by difference with cumulated depreciation of previous years, if any. An impairment is booked if the net value of the program is higher than the future revenue forecast. Initial depreciation of a scripted program is expensed at delivery while the remaining value is depreciated when the subsequent distribution revenues are recognized. _Grants and subsidies_ Grants and subsidies are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be fully complied with. Grants and subsidies which are strictly related to the financing of a given program are deducted from production costs. When they relate to an asset, grants and subsidies are directly deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and released to the depreciation and amortization calculated on the net amount over the useful life of the asset.

These entities form a single operating segment as the nature of their business is similar across the group (mainly ‘the production of audiovisual contents’) and they present similar long-term economic characteristics. - Distribution activity, constituted by Banijay Rights and its subsidiaries, whose activity differs from the rest of the group as those entities are in charge of selling finished tapes and formats. - ‘Others’ segment is mainly composed of holdings, Kids activities and certain specific operating activities (notably Digital & TV Channel).",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Objectives and strategies regarding financial risk management,"The main financial instruments of the group include bank borrowings (including a €35m multi-currency revolving credit facility undrawn as of December 31, 2018), bank overdrafts and trade payables. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide the group with the financial means necessary for its activities. The group has various financial assets, such as trade receivables, cash and short-term deposits, which are directly generated by its operations. The group’s strategy was, and remains, not to do any trading on derivative instruments. The main risks resulting from the financial instruments of the group involve liquidity risk, interest rate risk, exchange risk and credit risk. The risks of the entities of the group are managed by each entity according to the group’s strategy and in accordance with the Company’s instructions. F-77 ----- _Liquidity risk_ The group maintains adequate reserves of cash and short-term deposits to satisfy its liquidity needs. Besides, since 2013, the group treasury department implemented several liquidity concentration pools around the main business regions (Europe, US, UK & Scandinavia). Over 2018, approximately 85% of group’s revenue is covered by such mechanisms. Therefore, the organic growth of the group, its working capital needs as well as its financing commitments (including payment of earn-out debts or put option debts) are notably ensured by operating cash flows generated by the business units. As part of the refinancing, Banijay Group is subject to financial covenants. As of December 2018, all ratios impacting the group’s short-term liquidity are satisfied. _Interest rate risk_ The exposure of the group to the risk of interest rate fluctuations is mainly related to the c. €60m senior facilities agreement which has been drawn in GB pounds sterling and is dependent on LIBOR short-term interest rate. Considering the relatively stable level of LIBOR over the recent period, Brexit event and low proportion of such facilities in Banijay’s total external debts, the group regards its interest rate risk as remote. _Foreign currency risk_ The foreign subsidiaries of the group operate essentially on their own territory and sales or purchases within the group are not significant; as a result, the transactional foreign exchange risk is limited. For the group, the main currency risk is a translational foreign exchange risk, mostly linked to USD and GBP: - As of December 31, 2018, the percentage of sales carried out in US dollars represented 16.0% of the consolidated turnover. A decrease of 5% (resp. an increase of 5%) of the US dollar foreign exchange rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue of €(6.4) million (resp. €7.1 million). - As of December 31, 2018, the percentage of sales carried out in GB pounds represented 12.0% of the consolidated turnover. A decrease of 5% (resp. an increase of 5%) of the GB pounds sterling foreign exchange rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue of €(4.7) million (resp. €5.2 million). _Credit risk_ Credit risk occurs if a party to a transaction is unable or refuses to fulfil its obligations, causing a financial loss to the group. The group deals only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. Receivables are monitored regularly, so that the group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

These operations have been presented separately in the statement of cash flows as these constitute separate transactions. The terms and conditions of the ‘ORAN 1’ had led Banijay Group to recognize an embedded derivative within the Bonds with respect to the possibility to cap at 49.9% the interest of Vivendi in Banijay Group, should the bonds be converted into new shares. This option has been valued at €25m at issuance date—with counterpart in the group’s equity—and at €18m as of December 31[st], 2016—revalued through profit or loss of the period. As these convertible bonds have been fully refinanced as of December 31[st], 2017, the option loosed and was written off the balance sheet, while the €25m component that was initially booked within equity has been recycled into profit or loss.

Accounting treatment of significant events,1378.1.2,Implementation of a new long-term incentive plan for key employees,"The board of Directors of the group has approved in 2017 the scheme of a new long-term incentive plans for certain key employees of the group. The features of most of the plans consist in two allocations of phantom shares in 2019 and 2023, the liquidity being based on the value of the group and exercisable over a period between four and eight years after the vesting of the plans. Those plans have been analyzed as cash-settled sharebased payments. Two employees of the group will be granted free shares of Banijay Group over the 2016-2026 period and their incentive plans have therefore been considered as equity-settled share-based payments. Banijay Group considers that the beneficiaries have begun rendering services in exchange for the awards starting from 2017 based on the fact that it is in 2017 that (i) individual schemes were mutually agreed by Banijay Group and the different beneficiaries in that year and (i) the approval has been obtained by the board. The expense for the period related to the new incentive plans amounts to €(24.5)m, including €(11.7)m related to equity-settled plans.

Compliance with IFRS,1378.2.1,Standards and interpretations that are not yet effective have not been applied by anticipation by the group.,"Among those standards and interpretations, those which could affect the group’s future consolidated financial statements are: IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1[st], 2018 IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1[st], 2018 IFRS 16 “Leases” Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1[st], 2019 Banijay Group has assessed the potential impact of IFRS 9 on its financial statements. The group deals with limited financial assets apart from trade receivables. Under this new standard, trade receivables should be measured at recognition date by considering the expected probability of default, based on historical losses incurred. As the group deals with recognised and creditworthy third parties, its exposure to credit risk is limited. Hence Banijay Group’s management expects limited impacts from the first application of IFRS 9. Banijay Group has assessed the potential impact of IFRS 15 on its financial statements. Under this new standard, revenue arising from contracts with customers should be recognised according to a five-step model. The group has assessed its different revenue streams in the light of IFRS 15 and does not expect any impacts in terms of timing of revenue recognition. Under the new standard, revenue from contracts which include a significant financing component should be discounted to reflect the credit facility granted to the customer. The group does not expect material impacts related to the application of the financing component.

Main estimates and accounting assumptions,1378.3.1,,"The preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the group requires the management to use certain estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the carrying amount of revenues, costs, assets and liabilities. The main estimates and assumptions relate (i) to the valuation and useful lives of audiovisual rights, (ii) to the valuation of goodwill, (iii) to the amount of provisions for risks and other provisions in relation with the group’s activity, (iv) to the calculation of debt related to earn outs on acquisitions, (v) to the estimate of debt resulting from put options in favour of minority shareholders, and (vi) to the assumptions used for share-based payments. The features of main accounting methods, judgements and other uncertainties which affect the application of these accounting methods, as well as the sensitivity of the results to changes in the conditions and assumptions, are factors to be taken into account while reading these financial statements, as the outcomes of these estimations will, by definition, rarely equal the actual figures. There has been no significant change in the main estimates and accounting assumptions of the group over the period. F-99 ----- _Goodwill impairment_ The group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if goodwill has to be impaired. This requires the recoverable value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated, to be measured. The group mainly estimates the recoverable value through its value-in-use. The latter is determined by the management through a projection of expected future cash flows that are discounted at an appropriate rate. _Content assets depreciation_ The group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if the content assets presented in the balance sheet have to be impaired. The carrying value of these assets is compared to the net sales forecast of the said format over a maximum period of 10 years. _Earn-out payments / put option rights in favour of minority shareholders_ Following external growth transactions, the group can be committed to pay former/minority shareholders either earn-outs or further acquisition price pursuant to put options on their remaining shareholding, depending on future profits. Related debts are accounted for in the balance sheet at their present value. The group estimates these debts using assumptions on future profits and calculates scheduled cash outflows using a discount rate. _Share-based payments_ Share subscription, purchase options, phantom shares as well as free shares have been granted to certain employees of the group. These plans depend on the assumptions on future profits of the group. In 2017, the group signed new incentive agreements with certain key employees (which consist in phantom shares and free shares depending on the employee). The value of these plans depends on future profits of the relevant subsidiaries as well as on the equity value of the group. These plans have been valuated based on a probabilistic approach whose parameters are the expected value creation of the group and of the subsidiaries, volatility of the sector and an appropriate discount rate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Summary of key accounting methods,1378.4.2,Consolidation scope and methods,"_Subsidiaries_ In accordance with IFRS 10, the subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date when the group acquires an exclusive control over the subsidiary. Under this standard, the group controls a subsidiary if and only if all the conditions below are met: - Having power over the investee, i.e. the group has existing rights that gives it the ability to direct the relevant activities (the activities that significantly affect the subsidiary’s returns) - Having exposure, or rights, to variable returns from the involvement with the subsidiary - Having the ability to use its power over the subsidiary to affect the amount of the group’s returns. _Joint ventures and associates_ Joint ventures are the companies in which the Company exercises a joint control. Associates are investments in which the Company exercises a significant influence, i.e. it has the power to participate in the financial and operational decisions but does not have control. The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures and associates using the equity method. Under this method, interests in associates and joint ventures are recorded in the balance sheet at acquisition cost and are increased or reduced by the group’s share in the entity’s net assets, post-acquisition. Goodwill relating to acquired associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not depreciated. The statement of profit or loss reflects the group’s part in the results of operations of the related entity. Significant profits and losses resulting from transactions between the group and the associates and joint ventures are eliminated up to the percentage of interest in the entity. The percentage of legal interest held by the group in the consolidated companies as well as the consolidation methods are disclosed in Note 5.15 ‘Consolidation scope’.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Summary of key accounting methods,1378.4.3,Foreign currency translation,"The consolidated financial statements are established in euro, which is the functional and presentation currency of the group. _Translation of foreign-currency denominated transactions_ Each entity determines its own functional currency. The items of each entity’s financial statements are measured using the functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded initially at the exchange rate of the functional currency prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedging rate, if applicable. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate of the functional currency at the closing date and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are reported using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the initial transactions. Long-term monetary assets held by an entity of the group in a foreign subsidiary for which a settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, are a part of the net foreign investments. Thus, pursuant to the provisions of lAS 21 “The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates”, corresponding exchange rate differences are entered into “other comprehensive income” until the date the investment is disposed of. Otherwise, the exchange differences are recorded as profit or loss. Likewise, exchange differences relating to liabilities that are hedging instruments for net investments abroad, as provided for by lAS 39 “Financial Instruments—Recognition and measurement” are recorded as the exchange differences of the underlying hedge: they are booked in “other comprehensive income”. _Translation of subsidiaries’ foreign-currency denominated financial statements_ Assets and liabilities, including goodwill of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euro at the official exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date and their statement of profit or loss is translated at the average exchange F-101 ----- rate over the period considered. The resulting exchange differences are booked directly to equity in a separate heading denominated “Foreign currency translation reserve”. When a foreign entity is sold, the exchange differences accumulated in the “foreign currency translation reserve” allocated to the entity are transferred to profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

They can be commercially exploited either through internal use, i.e. the production of television programs by a Group entity, or through external use, i.e. the sale or licensing to third parties, - audiovisual rights, or catalogues, referred to as the group’s library of finished programs, whether acquired or internally developed, for which the group has legal right to distribute and to receive revenue from the distribution of the rights, - production contracts or client contracts, acquired through business combinations, for the production of television programs, TV movies, or cinematic movies, - fictions in progress: costs incurred for fiction productions that are not yet finalized and not delivered to the client at the closing date, - other intangible assets: rights for the movie adaptation of books, software, etc. Initial recognition Initial recognition of intangible assets is at cost, except for those acquired in a business combination, which are recognized at fair value. Depreciation & amortization Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Audiovisual rights are considered to have a definite useful life. Intangible assets are depreciated based on the consumption of the associated economic benefits and on the remaining useful life of the asset. Hence, audiovisual rights are depreciated on an accelerated basis following the decline in the net value of the asset following its initial broadcasting. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are depreciated: - Catalogue & formats: on a straight-line basis over a 10-year period - Client contracts: on a straight-line basis over the contract duration Software assets are depreciated over their estimated useful life (between 1 and 5 years). The depreciation period and the amortization method are reviewed at least at each financial year end.

Summary of key accounting methods,1378.4.6,Impairment of non-financial assets,"The recoverable amount of intangible assets, goodwill and tangible assets is tested for impairment as soon as external or internal signs of impairment losses exist, such signs being reviewed at each closing date (sector ratio declining, strong overall decrease in the business relating to the cash generating unit, fall in activity with a major customer of the cash-generating unit...). F-102 ----- If applicable, the recoverable amount of the asset is tested for impairment to determine whether there is an impairment loss. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, this test is performed at least once a year. If appropriate, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the net book value of the asset exceeding the recoverable amount (mostly measured through the asset’s value-in-use). The recoverable value of the assets to which it is possible to directly attribute independent cash inflows is assessed on a stand-alone basis. The other assets are Grouped within the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which they belong in order to estimate their value-in-use. A CGU is defined as the smallest Group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or Groups of assets. Following the acquisition of Zodiak Media, the goodwill allocated to the different CGUs have been determined according to the territories and taking into consideration the similarities between the different markets. Currently, Banijay Group management considers 5 CGUs. The value-in-use of an asset or a CGU is measured by the method of discounted cash flows, based on projections of future financial cash flows over the next 4 years. Forecasts are derived from plans presented to the Chairman and the Supervisory Board of the Company, with a projection to infinity using a growth rate. By assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted; the discount rate is a post-tax rate and reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Where an impairment loss is recognised, it is accounted for directly in the statement of profit or loss under a specific heading. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill can never be reversed. The value of assets, other than goodwill, for which an impairment loss has been recorded, is reviewed at each closing date for the purposes of reversing the impairment loss, if necessary. Where a reversal occurs, it is recorded as profit or loss. In such a case, the book value of the asset can be increased up to its recoverable value. After reversing the impairment loss, the book value cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of amortisation or depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,1378,5. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1378.4,5.3.4. Summary of key accounting methods,1378.4.7,Financial assets,"Financial assets are divided into the three following categories: loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Transactions relating to financial assets are recorded at settlement date. _Loans and receivables_ These financial assets are initially recognised at their fair value to which is added directly attributable transaction costs and, then at amortised cost at each closing date, applying the effective interest rate method. This category of assets includes trade receivables and other debtors, loans and deposits, receivables attached to participating interests, cash and loans to associates or non-consolidated entities. Loans and receivables are reviewed taking into account any objective indication of impairment. A financial asset is dealt with individually. A loss is recognised if the carrying amount is greater than the recoverable value estimated through impairment tests. The impairment, if any, is recorded in profit or loss and can be reversed if the recoverable amount is due to improve over the following years. _Held-to-maturity investments_ Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and a maturity fixed, that the entity intends and is able to hold until maturity. These investments are assessed and recorded at the amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. F-103 ----- They are examined with respect to any objective indication of impairment. A financial asset is dealt with individually. An impairment loss is recognised through profit or loss if the carrying amount is greater than the recoverable value estimated through impairment tests. _Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss_ These assets are accounted for at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded as profit or loss. This category includes: - Financial assets classified as held-for-trading, including the assets that a company intends to resell in a near term with the aim of realising a gain, that belong to a portfolio of financial instruments collectively managed and for which practice is short-term disposal; - Assets explicitly designated by the group at initial recognition. _Impairment testing of financial assets_ The group reviews if, at the closing date, a financial asset or a Group of financial assets is likely to suffer an impairment loss. If there is an objective evidence that loans and receivables carried at amortised cost should be impaired, the amount of the loss is estimated by difference between the book value and the discounted future cash flows such as expected (excluding future probable and not actual credit losses). The discount rate used is the initial effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of the asset). The book value is reduced through the use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recorded as profit or loss. If, subsequently, the impairment decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment will be reversed. The reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as profit or loss, as long as the book value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the date the loss allowance is reversed. With respect to receivables, a loss allowance is recorded when there is objective evidence (probability of insolvency or severe financial difficulties of the debtor) that the group will be unable to recover the balance in accordance with the initial payment conditions. The book value of the receivable is reduced by way of an allowance for loss. Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are considered as uncollectible.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Summary of key accounting methods,1378.4.11,Financial liabilities,"Financial liabilities are divided into three categories: financial liabilities at amortised cost, financial liabilities at fair value through “other comprehensive income” and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. F-104 ----- The financial liabilities of the group mainly consist of liabilities valued at amortised cost. Among them are loans and similar debts including: - Credit lines from banks and other production financings; - Bank overdrafts; - Borrowings; - Borrowings in relation to assets under finance leases; - Bonds and Secured Notes. The category of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss includes: - Liabilities considered as held-for-trading, which mainly include liabilities incurred or redeemed in the short term; - Liabilities explicitly designated at initial recognition by the group as financial instruments that do not meet the criteria of efficient hedge accounting according to lAS 39 “Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement”. Change in fair value is therefore recognised in profit or loss. Financial liabilities at fair value through “other comprehensive income” comprise financial instruments that meet the conditions of efficient hedge accounting according to lAS 39. _Interest-bearing debts and borrowings_ All loans, and debts (including the Senior Secured Notes issued in July 2017) are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received, less costs directly attributable to the transaction. After initial recognition, interest-bearing liabilities and debts are evaluated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised as profit or loss when liabilities are derecognised using the model of amortised cost. Costs directly attributable to the issuance of debt are deducted from liabilities and are amortised over the life of the debt, as a component of the effective interest rate. _Finance leases_ Finance lease contracts, which transfer to the group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset, are capitalised at the beginning of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the amortisation of the outstanding liability so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining term of the liability. Finance charges are expensed in the statement of profit or loss. The leased investments shown in the assets are depreciated over the shorter of the two durations: the expected useful life of the asset or the period of the lease, if there is no reasonable certainty that the group will get the ownership before the term of the lease. Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss. _Derivative financial instruments_ The group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts, options and interest rate swaps to cover its risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. These derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the date on which they are contracted. They are then re-estimated at their fair value at each closing date. Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets in the balance sheet when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. For those derivatives that meet the criteria of hedge accounting, gains or losses related to change in the fair value of derivatives during the financial year are accounted for in “other comprehensive income”. For those derivatives that do not meet the conditions, they are recognised directly as profit or loss. F-105 ----- The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to the forward exchange rates applicable to contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to the market values of similar instruments. The fair value of financial instruments that are traded on active markets is determined at each closing date by reference to the market quotations or transaction prices. Transaction costs are not taken into account. For instruments that are not traded on an active market, fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. These may include: - Transactions entered into under normal market conditions between knowledgeable and willing parties; - reference to the present fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same; - discounted cash flows or other valuation methods.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The charges relating to provisions are accounted for as profit or loss, net of any contingent reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a discount pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the obligation. When discounting, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in net financial income (loss). _Pensions and other defined post-employment benefit plans_ The group’s obligations under defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are computed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions such as discount rates, retirement date, staff turnover, future increases of wages, mortality rates and future pension increases. For these post-employment benefit plans, the actuarial gain and losses are immediately and entirely recognized in other comprehensive income with no possibility of recycling in the income statement. Past service costs are immediately and fully recorded in the income statement on acquired rights as well as on future entitlements. The effect of discounting of the provision are presented in the net financial income (loss).",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Summary of key accounting methods,1378.4.13,Revenue recognition,"Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably estimated. Revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of commissions, pay-backs, grants, subsidies and co-producers contribution. _Production revenues (from producing television programs)_ Production revenues are recognized when the programs are delivered to the client. Standard criteria to establish revenue recognition are: - in most cases: client’s acceptance document (i.e. delivery notice signed / approved by the client, …) - delivery of a certain number of episodes - expiry of the period stated in the contract to reject or return the product In case of partial delivery of the same program over several periods of time (series, etc...), revenue, costs and margin are recognized according to deliveries. F-106 ----- Production revenues are booked net of grants, subsidies and co-production financing. The group does not expect any impact of the first application of IFRS 15 in connection with timing or amount of revenue recognition. _Distribution revenues (from the sale of finished programs)_ Distribution revenues are recognized when the rights are transferred to the client: - on the basis of a signed contract or a deal memo, and - when the related rights are opened, and - for the full revenue (revenues are not spread over the licensing period). As a result, distribution revenues are only recognized when productions are completed and delivered. _Revenues from other rights and services_ Other rights and services include merchandising, music rights, other ancillary revenues and digital services. Merchandising revenues are recognized when the rights are transferred to the client: - on the basis of a signed contract or a deal memo, and - when the licensing period begins, and - for the full revenue (revenues are not spread over the licensing period). Advanced payments are recognized as revenue when the above criteria are met and further payments are recognized when received. Revenues from music rights are recognized as revenues when received. Revenues and costs related to the rendering of services are recognized on completion of the service rendered as long as they can be estimated reliably. When the outcome of the transaction cannot be estimated reliably, revenue shall be recognized only to the extent of the expenses recognized.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Summary of key accounting methods,1378.4.14,Production costs,"Production costs are net of co-producers’ contributions, grants and subsidies (refer below). They mainly include the costs of scripts, actors, directors, rental of equipment, technical staff, participants, hosts, sets, format fees, etc. Until programs are delivered, related production costs are capitalized in work in progress for non-scripted programs and as intangible assets for scripted programs for which (i) the group retains the IP and (ii) the group expects significant further IP revenue. At revenue recognition date, the production costs of non-scripted programs are expensed in the income statement. The production costs of scripted programs for which the group retains the IP are amortized as production costs in the statement of profit or loss using the ultimate revenue method. The cumulated amortization is calculated at the end of a given year as follows: Production costs x (actual cumulated revenue / total estimated revenue of program). The total estimated revenue of a program is the sum of actual cumulated revenue of the program and the program’s future revenue forecast. Depreciation for a current year is calculated by difference with cumulated depreciation of previous years, if any. An impairment is booked if the net value of the program is higher than the future revenue forecast. Initial depreciation of a scripted program is expensed at delivery while the remaining value is depreciated when the subsequent distribution revenues are recognized. F-107 ----- _Grants and subsidies_ Grants and subsidies are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be fully complied with. Grants and subsidies which are strictly related to the financing of a given program are deducted from production costs. When they relate to an asset, grants and subsidies are directly deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and released to the depreciation and amortization calculated on the net amount over the useful life of the asset. All other grants and subsidies (such as government grants, like income tax credit called CICA in France) are recognized as “Other operating income” when granted.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

As indicated in Note 5.3.1. ‘Accounting treatment of significant events—Implementation of a new long-term incentive plan for key employees’, the group has implemented a new long-term incentive plan for some key employees of the group. This scheme is based on the local value creation of the entities in which the beneficiaries of the plan are rendering services, weighted by the total value creation of the group and has been valued using a probabilistic approach. Main parameters of this model are: - the discount rate, which corresponds to Banijay Group current effective interest rate, - the volatility of Banijay Group equity value, based on the implied volatility observed on a sample of peers, - the expected net profits after tax of the different entities of the group based on the latest business plan presented to the Board of Directors.

Summary of key accounting methods,1378.4.17,Tax,"_Current tax_ Tax receivables or tax payables for the current period and prior periods are estimated at the amount that is expected to be received from or to be paid to the tax administration. Tax rates and tax laws used in order to estimate the tax receivable or the tax liability are those which have been enacted at closing date. Current income taxes pertaining to items recognised in “other comprehensive income” are recorded in the same category and not as profit or loss. _Deferred tax_ Deferred tax is accounted for by applying the liability method to temporary differences existing at the closing date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying value in the financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on all taxable temporary differences, except: - when the deferred tax liability is generated by the initial recognition of goodwill, or by an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and which, at the date of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit, nor the taxable profit or tax loss; F-108 ----- - for taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the date on which the temporary difference will reverse can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and any carry forward of unused tax credits and tax losses insofar as it is probable that the calculated deferred tax assets can be charged on taxable profit, except: - where the deferred tax asset relates to a deductible temporary difference generated by the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and which, at the transaction date, affects neither accounting profit, nor the taxable profit or tax loss; - for taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where deferred tax assets are recognised only when it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and that taxable profit will be available against which it will be possible to utilise the temporary differences. The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reassessed at each closing date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the use of all or part of the deferred tax asset. The deferred tax assets not recognised are reviewed at each closing date and are accounted for to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will enable the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year the asset will be realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the closing date. Deferred taxes related to items recognised in “other comprehensive income“ are recorded in the same category and not in profit or loss. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and if deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and to the same taxation authority.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

As of December 31, 2017, Banijay Group recognizes two main operating segments: - Production activity, which encompasses all production entities of the group. These entities form a single operating segment as the nature of their business is similar across the group (mainly ‘the production of audiovisual contents’) and they present similar long-term economic characteristics. - Distribution activity, constituted by Banijay Rights and its subsidiaries, whose activity differs from the rest of the group as the entity is in charge of selling finished tapes and formats.

The group has restructured the capital of Banijay Editing and its subsidiaries Non Stop Production and Non Stop Edition on December 27, 2017. Pursuant to this reorganisation, the shares held by Financière 3 Chênes in Non Stop Edition and Non Stop Production were brought to Banijay Editing in exchange for 33.3% of Banijay Editing share capital. Apart from this operation, Groupe Canal+ took a 33.3% stake in Banijay Editing. Following this reorganisation, Banijay Group now owns 33.3% of Banijay Editing, Non Stop Production & Non Stop Edition. Following this restructuration, the group still has control over Banijay Editing and its subsidiaries. On June 22[nd], 2017, two managers of the group contributed their shares in Banijay Entertainment to Banijay Group in exchange of newly issued shares of Banijay Group. This operation had an accretive impact on the group’s interest in Banijay Entertainment (from 97.6% to 99.7%), and its subsidiaries. In 2017, Banijay Studio International, a newly formed joint venture, launched several UK scripted entities called ‘Fearless Minds Ltd’, ‘Neon Ink Ltd’ and ‘Yellowbird UK’.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

This merger was structured as a reverse merger pursuant to which Lov Group, Banijay’s main shareholder, took over the control of Zodiak Media, the parent entity of the Zodiak Media group, which absorbed Banijay Holding, the parent of the Banijay group, before being renamed Banijay Group. The fair value of the consideration transferred under this reverse merger amounted to €44.7m.

Objectives and strategies regarding financial risk management,"The main financial instruments of the group include bank borrowings (including a €35m multi-currency revolving credit facility undrawn as of December 31, 2017), bank overdrafts and trade payables. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide the group with the financial means necessary for its activities. The group has various financial assets, such as trade receivables, cash and short-term deposits, which are directly generated by its operations. The group’s strategy was, and remains, not to do any trading on derivative instruments. The main risks resulting from the financial instruments of the group involve liquidity risk, interest rate risk, exchange risk and credit risk. The risks of the entities of the group are managed by each entity according to the group’s strategy and in accordance with the Company’s instructions. _Liquidity risk_ The group maintains adequate reserves of cash and short-term deposits to satisfy its liquidity needs. Besides, since 2013, the group treasury department implemented several liquidity concentration pools around the main business regions (Europe, US, UK & Scandinavia). Over 2017, approximately 90% of group’s revenue is covered by such mechanisms. Therefore, the organic growth of the group, its working capital needs as well as its financing commitments (including payment of earn-out debts or put option debts) are notably ensured by operating cash flows generated by the business units. F-122 ----- As part of the refinancing, Banijay Group is now subject to new financial covenants. As of December 2017, all ratios impacting the group’s short-term liquidity are satisfied. _Interest rate risk_ The exposure of the group to the risk of interest rate fluctuations is mainly related to the c. €60m senior facilities agreement which has been drawn in GB pounds sterling and is dependent on LIBOR short-term interest rate. Considering the low / negative level of LIBOR over the recent period, the group regards its interest rate risk as remote. _Foreign currency risk_ The foreign subsidiaries of the group operate essentially on their own territory and sales or purchases within the group are not significant; as a result, the transactional foreign exchange risk is limited. For the group, the main currency risk is a translational foreign exchange risk, mostly linked to USD and GBP: - As of December 31, 2017, the percentage of sales carried out in US dollars represented 22.0% of the consolidated turnover. A decrease of 5% (resp. an increase of 5%) of the US dollar foreign exchange rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue of €(8.9)m (resp. €9.8m). - As of December 31, 2017, the percentage of sales carried out in GB pounds represented 10.5% of the consolidated turnover. A decrease of 5% (resp. an increase of 5%) of the GB pounds sterling foreign exchange rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue of €(4.2)m (resp. €4.7m). _Credit risk_ Credit risk occurs if a party to a transaction is unable or refuses to fulfil its obligations, causing a financial loss to the group. The group deals only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. Receivables are monitored regularly, so that the group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Main estimates and accounting assumptions,1378.126.1,,"The preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group requires the Group’s management to use certain estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the carrying amount of revenues, costs, assets and liabilities. The main estimates and assumptions relate to the valuation and useful lives of audiovisual rights, of goodwill, to the amount of provisions for risks and other provisions in relation with the Group’s activity, to the calculation of debt related to earn outs on acquisitions, to the estimate of debt resulting from put options in favour of minority shareholders, to the assumptions used for share-based payments, to the valuation of the put option relating to the redeemable bond. The features of main accounting methods, judgements and other uncertainties which affect the application of these accounting methods, as well as the sensitivity of the results to changes in the conditions and assumptions, are factors to be taken into account while reviewing these financial statements. Indeed, the Group prepares estimates and assumptions concerning future transactions. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely equal the actual figures. _Goodwill impairment_ The Group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if goodwill has to be impaired. This requires the recoverable value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill has been F-141 ----- allocated, to be measured. The Group mainly estimates the recoverable value through its value-in-use. The latter is determined by the management through a projection of expected future cash flows that are discounted at an appropriate rate. See note 5.3.3.4. for further details. _Content assets depreciation_ The Group reviews, at least once a year, and at any time when a trigger event for impairment occurs, if the content assets presented in the balance sheet has to be impaired. The carrying value of these assets is compared to the net sales forecast of said format over 10 years. _Earn-out payments / put option rights in favour of minority shareholders_ Following external growth transactions, the Group can be committed to pay former/minority shareholders either earn-outs or further acquisition price pursuant to put options on their remaining shareholding, based on prices depending on future profits. Related debts are accounted for in the balance sheet at their present value. The Group estimates these debts using assumptions on future profits and calculates scheduled cash outflows using a discount rate. _Put option rights relating to the redeemable bonds_ The Black and Scholes valuation model used is based on the assumptions of a valuation of the Group and a volatility rate. The valuation of the Group is based on a multi-criteria analysis method that applies the two following methods: - The income approach methodology (DCF method) which uses assumptions as to the future cash flows of the Group, a discount rate, … - The market approach methodology which is based on comparable transactions that have occurred on the market. _Share-based payments_ Share subscription and purchase options, as well as free shares have been granted to certain employees of the Group. The value of these plans depends on the future profits of the Group or specific companies within the Group. The Group estimates these plans using assumptions on future profits and calculates scheduled cash outflows using a discount rate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

458_2,Offerings 2020.md,1378,5. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1378.127,5.3.3. Summary of key accounting methods,1378.127.3,,"The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and those of its subsidiaries on December 31, 2016. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared on the same accounting period as that of the Company, using homogeneous accounting principles. All balances, transactions, revenues and expenses, intra-Group profits and losses resulting from transactions with Group companies are eliminated. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group acquires control. They continue to be fully consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The results of the operations of subsidiaries acquired or sold during a given year are recognised in the consolidated results from the date of acquisition or up to the date of divestment. Non-controlling Interests represent the portion of profit or loss and the net assets not owned by the Group. They are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss as well as in equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from the equity attributable to the shareholders of the Company. 5.3.3.1. Current / non-current distinction According to lAS 1 “Presentation of financial statements”, the assets and liabilities are classified as current when their recoverability or their payment is expected no later than 12 months from the closing date, with the exception of deferred taxes which are shown as non-current assets and liabilities. F-142 ----- 5.3.3.2. Consolidation scope and methods _Subsidiaries_ The companies in which the Company holds directly or indirectly more than 50% of the voting rights or operates an exclusive control are fully consolidated. _Joint ventures and associated companies_ Joint ventures are the companies in which the Company exercises a joint control. Associated companies are investments in which the Company exercises a significant influence, i.e. it has the power to participate in the financial and operational decisions but does not have control. The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures and associates using the equity method. Under this method, interests in associates and joint ventures are recorded in the balance sheet at acquisition cost and are increased or reduced by the Group’s share in the entity’s net assets, post-acquisition. Goodwill relating to acquired associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not depreciated. The statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s part in the results of operations of the related entity. Significant profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associates and joint ventures are eliminated up to the percentage of interest in the entity. The percentage of interest held by the Group in the consolidated companies as well as the consolidation methods are disclosed in note 5.12. 5.3.3.3. Foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are established in euro, which is the functional and presentation currency of the Group. _Translation of foreign-currency denominated transactions_ Each entity determines its own functional currency. The items of each entity’s financial statements are measured using the functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded initially at the exchange rate of the functional currency prevailing at the transaction date or at the hedging rate, if applicable. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate of the functional currency at the closing date and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are reported using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the initial transactions. Long-term monetary assets held by an entity of the Group in a foreign subsidiary for which a settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, are a part of the net foreign investments. Thus, pursuant to the provisions of lAS 21 “The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates”, corresponding exchange rate differences are entered into “other comprehensive income” until the date the investment is disposed of. Otherwise, the exchange differences are recorded as profit or loss. Likewise, exchange differences relating to liabilities that are hedging instruments for net investments abroad, as provided for by lAS 39 “Financial Instruments—Recognition and measurement”, are recorded as the exchange differences of the underlying hedge: they are booked in “other comprehensive income”. _Translation of subsidiaries’ foreign-currency denominated financial statements_ Assets and liabilities, including goodwill of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euro at the official exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date and their statement of profit or loss is translated at the average exchange rate over the period considered. The resulting exchange differences are booked directly to equity in a separate heading denominated “Foreign currency translation reserve”. When a foreign entity is sold, the exchange differences accumulated in the “foreign currency translation reserve” allocated to the entity are transferred to profit or loss. F-143 ----- 5.3.3.4. Intangible assets Intangible assets include: - format rights acquired from a third party or through business combinations. They can be commercially exploited either through internal use, i.e. the production of television programs by a Group entity, or through external use, i.e. the sale or licensing to third parties, - audiovisual rights, or catalogues, referred to as the Group’s library of finished programs, whether acquired or internally developed, for which the Group has legal right to distribute and to receive revenue from the distribution of the rights, - production contracts or client contracts, acquired through business combinations, for the production of television programs, TV movies, or cinematic movies, - fictions in progress: costs incurred for fiction productions that are not yet finalized and not delivered to the client at the closing date, - other intangible assets: rights for the movie adaptation of books, software, etc. Initial recognition Initial recognition of intangible assets is at cost, except for those acquired in a business combination, which are recognized at fair value. Depreciation & amortization Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Audiovisual rights are considered to have a definite useful life. An amendment of IAS 38, effective January 1[st], 2016, stressed the fact that intangible assets should be depreciated based on the consumption of the associated economic benefits and on the remaining useful life of the asset. Hence, audiovisual rights are depreciated on an accelerated basis following the decline in the net value of the asset following its initial broadcasting. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are depreciated: - Catalogue: on a straight-line basis over a 10-year period - Client contracts: on a straight-line basis over the contract duration Software assets are depreciated over their estimated useful life (between 1 and 5 years). The depreciation period and the amortization method are reviewed at least at each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the depreciation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. 5.3.3.5. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at their acquisition cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of such fixed assets. The residual value, the useful life and depreciation methods of the fixed assets are reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, at each financial year-end. 5.3.3.6. Impairment of non-financial assets The recoverable amount of intangible assets, goodwill and tangible assets is tested for impairment as soon as external or internal signs of impairment losses exist, such signs being reviewed at each closing date (sector ratio declining, strong overall decrease in the business relating to the cash generating unit, fall in activity with a major customer of the cash-generating unit...). F-144 ----- If applicable, the recoverable amount of the asset is tested for impairment to determine whether there is an impairment loss. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, this test is performed at least once a year. If appropriate, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the net book value of the asset exceeding the recoverable amount (mostly measured through the asset’s value-in-use). The recoverable value of the assets to which it is possible to directly attribute independent cash inflows is assessed on a stand-alone basis. The other assets are Grouped within the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which they belong in order to estimate their value-in-use. A CGU is defined as the smallest Group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or Groups of assets. Following the acquisition of Zodiak Media Group, the goodwill CGUs have been redetermined according to the territories and taking into consideration the similarities between the different markets. The value-in-use of an asset or a CGU is measured by the method of discounted cash flows, based on projections of future financial cash flows over the next 4 years. Forecasts are derived from plans validated by the Chairman and the Supervisory Board of the Company, with a projection to infinity using a growth rate. By assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted; the discount rate is a post-tax rate and reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Where an impairment loss is recognised, it is accounted for directly in the statement of profit or loss under a specific heading. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill can never be reversed. The value of assets, other than goodwill, for which an impairment loss has been recorded, is reviewed at each closing date for the purposes of reversing the impairment loss, if necessary. Where a reversal occurs, it is recorded as profit or loss. In such a case, the book value of the asset can be increased up to its recoverable value. After reversing the impairment loss, the book value cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of amortisation or depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 5.3.3.7. Financial assets Financial assets are divided into the three following categories: loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Transactions relating to financial assets are recorded at settlement date. _Loans and receivables_ These financial assets are initially recognised at their fair value to which is added directly attributable transaction costs and, then at amortised cost at each closing date, applying the effective interest rate method. This category of assets includes trade receivables and other debtors, loans and deposits, receivables attached to participating interests, cash and loans to associates or non-consolidated entities. Loans and receivables are reviewed taking into account any objective indication of impairment. A financial asset is dealt with individually. A loss is recognised if the carrying amount is greater than the recoverable value estimated through impairment tests. The impairment, if any, is recorded in profit or loss and can be reversed if the recoverable amount is due to improve over the following years. _Held-to-maturity investments_ Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and a maturity fixed, that the entity intends and is able to hold until maturity. These investments are assessed and recorded at the amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. F-145 ----- They are examined with respect to any objective indication of impairment. A financial asset is dealt with individually. An impairment loss is recognised through profit or loss if the carrying amount is greater than the recoverable value estimated through impairment tests. _Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss_ These assets are accounted for at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded as profit or loss. This category includes: - Financial assets classified as held-for-trading, including the assets that a company intends to resell in a near term with the aim of realising a gain, that belong to a portfolio of financial instruments collectively managed and for which practice is short-term disposal; - Assets explicitly designated by the Group at initial recognition. _Impairment testing of financial assets_ The Group reviews if, at the closing date, a financial asset or a Group of financial assets is likely to suffer an impairment loss. If there is an objective evidence that loans and receivables carried at amortised cost should be impaired, the amount of the loss is estimated by difference between the book value and the discounted future cash flows such as expected (excluding future probable and not actual credit losses). The discount rate used is the initial effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of the asset). The book value is reduced through the use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recorded as profit or loss. If, subsequently, the impairment decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment will be reversed. The reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as profit or loss, as long as the book value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the date the loss allowance is reversed. With respect to receivables, a loss allowance is recorded when there is objective evidence (probability of insolvency or severe financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will be unable to recover the debt in accordance with the initial payment conditions. The book value of the receivable is reduced by way of an allowance for loss. Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are considered as uncollectible. 5.3.3.8. Financial investments Non-consolidated equity securities are initially entered at acquisition cost and are reduced, if required, on the basis of the market value. 5.3.3.9. Inventories Inventories relating to work in progress are valued at production cost. They represent outstanding production of audiovisual programs, excluding fictions for which the Group retains a part of the IP, that are not finalised and not delivered to the client at closing date. In the case that production losses are anticipated, a provision for losses on onerous contract is accounted for, after inventories have been written off. 5.3.3.10. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits include liquid and available bank accounts as well as short-term deposits whose initial maturity is less than three months. For the needs of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are composed of the cash and cash equivalent as defined above as well as bank overdrafts. 5.3.3.11. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are divided into three categories: financial liabilities at amortised cost, financial liabilities at fair value through “other comprehensive income” and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. F-146 ----- The financial liabilities of the Group mainly consist of liabilities valued at amortised cost. Among them are loans and similar debts including: - Credit lines from banks; - Bank overdrafts; - Borrowings; - Borrowings in relation to assets under finance leases; - Bonds. The category of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss includes: - Liabilities considered as held-for-trading, which mainly include liabilities incurred or redeemed in the short term; - Liabilities explicitly designated at initial recognition by the Group as financial instruments that do not meet the criteria of efficient hedge accounting according to lAS 39 “Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement”. Change in fair value is therefore recognised in profit or loss. Financial liabilities at fair value through “other comprehensive income” comprise financial instruments that meet the conditions of efficient hedge accounting according to lAS 39. _Interest-bearing debts and borrowings_ All loans and debts are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received, less costs directly attributable to the transaction. After initial recognition, interest-bearing liabilities and debts are evaluated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised as profit or loss when liabilities are derecognised using the model of amortised cost. Costs directly attributable to the issuance of debt are deducted from liabilities and are amortised over the life of the debt, as a component of the effective interest rate. _Finance leases_ Finance lease contracts, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset, are capitalised at the beginning of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the amortisation of the outstanding liability so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining term of the liability. Finance charges are expensed in the statement of profit or loss. The leased investments shown in the assets are depreciated over the shorter of the two durations: the expected useful life of the asset or the period of the lease, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will get the ownership before the term of the lease. Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss. _Derivative financial instruments_ The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts, options and interest rate swaps to cover its risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. These derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the date on which they are contracted. They are then re-estimated at their fair value at each closing date. Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets in the balance sheet when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. For those derivatives that meet the criteria of hedge accounting, gains or losses related to change in the fair value of derivatives during the financial year are accounted for in “other comprehensive income”. For those derivatives that do not meet the conditions, they are recognised directly as profit or loss. F-147 ----- The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to the forward exchange rates applicable to contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to the market values of similar instruments. The fair value of financial instruments that are traded on active markets is determined at each closing date by reference to the market quotations or transaction prices. Transaction costs are not taken into account. For instruments that are not traded on an active market, fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. These may include: - Transactions entered into under normal market conditions between knowledgeable and willing parties; - reference to the present fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same; - discounted cash flows or other valuation methods. _Redeemable bonds_ On February 23rd, 2016, Banijay issued redeemable bonds, fully subscribed by a Vivendi entity, redeemable in cash or in shares of the Company, at the election of the Company only, and according to the below conditions: - Redemption in shares at the maturity date only; - The number of shares of the Company is determined on the basis of the amount due (principal and accrued interests), capped at a number such that all shares owned by all Vivendi entities represent a maximum of 49.9% of the share capital of the Company, including the current shareholding of 26.2%; - If the cap of 49.9% is reached, the amount redeemed will be below the principal and accrued interests and no compensation will be paid to Vivendi. Following the guidance of IAS 39, the Company’s option to redeem the bonds with a consideration below that of the principal and accrued interests has been qualified by the Company as an embedded derivative that should be separated from its host contract. The fair value calculation of the option at subscription date was performed by using a “Black-Scholes” Model. The “gain” resulting from the initial recognition of this option was accounted for as “other comprehensive income” as it is regarded as a contribution from an equity participant made when Vivendi subscribed to shares in the Company. Subsequently, the embedded derivative will be valued at fair value through the statement of profit or loss. The nominal value of the bonds (1,000 bonds with a nominal value of €100.000 each totalling €100 million) is booked as a liability. 5.3.3.12. Provisions Provisions are recorded only if: - the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; and - it is likely that an expenditure will be required to settle the obligation; and - a reliable estimate can be made as to the amount of the payment obligation. The charges relating to provisions are accounted for as profit or loss, net of any contingent reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a discount pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the obligation. When discounting, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in finance costs. _Pensions and other defined post-employment benefit plans_ The Group’s obligations under defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are computed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions such as discount rates, retirement date, staff turnover, future increases of wages, mortality rates and future pension increases. For these post-employment benefit plans, the actuarial gain and losses are immediately and entirely recognized in other comprehensive income with no possibility of recycling in the income statement. Past service costs are immediately and fully recorded in the income statement on acquired rights as well as on future entitlements. The effect of discounting of the provision are presented in the net financial income (loss). F-148 ----- 5.3.3.13. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably estimated. Revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of commissions, pay-backs, grants, subsidies and co-producers contribution. _Production revenues (from producing television programs)_ Production revenues are recognized when the programs are delivered to the client. Standard criteria to establish revenue recognition are: - in most cases: client’s acceptance document (i.e. delivery notice signed / approved by the client, …) - delivery of a certain number of episodes - expiry of the period stated in the contract to reject or return the product In case of partial delivery of the same program over several periods of time (series, etc...), revenue, costs and margin are recognized according to deliveries. Production revenues are booked net of grants, subsidies and co-production financing. _Distribution revenues (from the sale of finished programs)_ Distribution revenues are recognized when the rights are transferred to the client: - on the basis of a signed contract or a deal memo, and - when the related rights are opened, and - for the full revenue (revenues are not spread over the licensing period). As a result, distribution revenues are only recognized when productions are completed and delivered. _Revenues from other rights and services_ Other rights and services include merchandising, music rights, other ancillary revenues and digital services. Merchandising revenues are recognized when the rights are transferred to the client: - on the basis of a signed contract or a deal memo, and - when the licensing period begins, and - for the full revenue (revenues are not spread over the licensing period). Advanced payments are recognized as revenue when the above criteria are met and further payments are recognized when received. Revenues from music rights are recognized as revenues when received. Revenues and costs related to the rendering of services are recognized on completion of the service rendered as long as they can be estimated reliably. A service can be considered delivered when the milestones specified in the contract has been reached. However, if the contract specifies and schedules several completion milestones, then revenues and costs can be recognized partially according to the defined completion milestones. For practical reasons, when services are performed by an undetermined series of actions over a specified period of time, revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the specified period, unless there is some evidence that some other method better represents the stage of completion (as described above). When the outcome of the transaction cannot be estimated reliably, revenue shall be recognized only to the extent of the expenses recognized. F-149 ----- _Grants and subsidies_ Grants and subsidies are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be fully complied with. Grants and subsidies which are strictly related to the financing of a given program are deducted from production costs. When they relate to an asset, grants and subsidies are directly deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and released to the amortization and depreciation calculated on the net amount over the useful life of the asset. All other grants and subsidies (such as government grants, like income tax credit called CICA in France) are recognized as “Other operating income” when granted. 5.3.3.14. Production costs Production costs are net of co-producers’ contributions, grants and subsidies. They mainly include the costs of scripts, actors, directors, rental of equipment, technical staff, participants, hosts, sets, format fees, ... Until programs are delivered, related production costs are capitalized in work in progress for non-scripted programs and as intangible assets for scripted programs for which the Group retains the IP. On delivery, the production costs of non-scripted programs are expensed in the income statement. The production costs of scripted programs for which the Group retains the IP are amortized as production costs in the statement of profit or loss using the ultimate revenue method. The cumulated amortization is calculated at the end of a given year as follows: Production costs x (actual cumulated revenue / total estimated revenue of program). The total estimated revenue of a program is the sum of actual cumulated revenue of the program and the program’s future revenue forecast. Depreciation for a current year is calculated by difference with cumulated depreciation of previous years, if any. An impairment is booked if the net value of the program is higher than the future revenue forecast. Initial depreciation of a scripted program upon delivery is expensed in production costs while subsequent depreciation is accounted for in depreciation & amortization of intangible assets. 5.3.3.15. Determination of current operating profit (loss) The format of the statement of profit or loss chosen by the Group presents a classification based on the nature of expenses. Current operating profit is calculated as the difference between pre-tax operating income and costs, other than finance costs and revenue, excluding share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted companies as well as any profits or losses from activities that have been or are being discontinued. 5.3.3.16. Other operating income and expenses These comprise income and expenses that are both unusual in nature and significant in terms of value at the consolidated level. The Group presents such income and expenses separately in the statement of profit or loss in order to facilitate the understanding of the recurring operating performance that they are not part of. 5.3.3.17. Share subscription, purchase plans and free shares Share subscription and purchase options, as well as free shares, have been granted to certain employees of the Group and are settled in cash or equity. In accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based payment” as it relates to cash-settled schemes, the options are valued at the date of grant using different valuation models. Changes in value subsequent to the date of grant impact the initial measurement. These values are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The resulting expense is recorded under payroll costs, counterpart of which is an operating liability, at fair value at closing date (any variation is recognised in profit or loss). F-150 ----- 5.3.3.18. Tax _Current tax_ Tax receivables or tax payables for the current period and prior periods are estimated at the amount that is expected to be received from or to be paid to the tax administration. Tax rates and tax laws used in order to estimate the tax receivable or the tax liability are those which have been finally adopted or are close to being adopted at the closing date. Current income taxes pertaining to items recognised in “other comprehensive income” are recorded in the same category and not as profit or loss. _Deferred tax_ Deferred tax is accounted for by applying the liability method to temporary differences existing at the closing date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying value in the financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on all taxable temporary differences, except: - when the deferred tax liability is generated by the initial recognition of goodwill, or by an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and which, at the date of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit, nor the taxable profit or tax loss; - for taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the date on which the temporary difference will reverse can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and any carry forward of unused tax credits and tax losses insofar as it is probable that the calculated deferred tax assets can be charged on taxable profit, except: - where the deferred tax asset relates to a deductible temporary difference generated by the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and which, at the transaction date, affects neither accounting profit, nor the taxable profit or tax loss; - for taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where deferred tax assets are recognised only when it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and that taxable profit will be available against which it will be possible to utilise the temporary differences. The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reassessed at each closing date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the use of all or part of the deferred tax asset. The deferred tax assets not recognised are reviewed at each closing date and are accounted for to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will enable the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year the asset will be realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the closing date. Deferred taxes related to items recognised in “other comprehensive income” are recorded in the same category and not in profit or loss. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and if deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and to the same taxation authority.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Objectives and strategies regarding financial risk management,"The main financial instruments of the Group include bank borrowings, bank overdrafts and trade payables. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide the Group with the financial means necessary for its activities. The Group has various financial assets, such as trade receivables, cash and short-term deposits, which are directly generated by its operations. The Group’s strategy was, and remains not to do any trading on derivative instruments. The main risks resulting from the financial instruments of the Group involve cash flows, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, exchange risk and credit risk. The risks of the entities of the Group are managed by each entity according to the Group’s strategy and in accordance with the Company’s instructions. _Interest rate risk_ The exposure of the Group to the risk of interest rate fluctuations is mainly related to the €275m term loan facilities. In May 2016, the Group entered into hedging agreements with several banks in order to hedge 67% of implied interest rate risk. _Exchange risk_ The foreign subsidiaries of the Group operate essentially on their own territory and sales or purchases within the Group are not significant; as a result, cash flows in the Group are not sensitive to changes in the currencies. F-163 ----- For the Group, the main currency risk is linked to US dollar fluctuations: As of December 31, 2016, the percentage of sales carried out in US dollars represented 23,39% of the consolidated turnover. A variation of (5)% of the U.S. dollar exchange rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue for €(8)m and on the consolidated operating profit for €(1)m. - As of December 31, 2016, the percentage of sales carried out in GBP pounds represented 10.97% of the consolidated turnover. A variation of (5)% of the GBP pounds exchange rate would have an impact on the consolidated revenue for €(3.8)m and on the consolidated operating profit for € (0.2)m. _Credit risk_ Credit risk occurs if a party to a transaction is unable or refuses to fulfil its obligations, causing a financial loss to the Group. The Group deals only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. Receivables are monitored regularly, so that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. _Liquidity risk_ The Group maintains adequate reserves of cash and short-term deposits in order to satisfy its liquidity needs. Since 2013, the Group treasury department has implemented several liquidity concentration pools around the main business regions (Europe, US, UK & Scandinavia ). By the end of 2016, approximately 90% of Group’s revenue is covered by such mechanisms. Therefore, the organic growth of the Group and its working capital needs are ensured by operating cash flow generated by the business units. _Financial debts maturity at the end of December 31 2016, based on undiscounted cash flows._ In € thousand_ **< 1 year",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Although the loss after tax has improved from 2018, a loss was imminent as the Company is highly leveraged and therefore incurs high interest costs on the 1st and 2nd lien loans as well as higher foreign exchange losses were realised in the year to date. A cash flow forecast for the next 12 months prepared by management has indicated that the Company will have sufficient cash to be able to meet its debt repayments as a result of better management of net working capital and no net outflow on the Receivable Securitisation facility. The directors feel positive that the shareholders’ facilities, due in June 2020, will be carried forward and that shareholders will continue to give their support. As per 30 September 2019, total drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) are amounting to EUR 50 million (December 2018: EUR 25 million). In 2019, management extended the maturity date of the RCF to May 2021. The RCF is part of the wider group financing agreement which covers the 1st Lien and 2nd Lien term debt as well. Considering the value of the company, its business plans and prior experience, the directors expect that the Company will be able to successfully extend or refinance its RCF or broader debt portfolio prior to maturity. Accordingly, no adjustments have been made to the financial statements relating to the recoverability and classification of the assets, carrying amounts, or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern. At this time, the directors are of the opinion that the assets are likely to be realised at the amount at which they are recorded in the financial statements as at 30 September 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Under the new lease standard, assets leased by the Company are being recognized in the statement of financial positions with a corresponding lease liability. Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from IAS 17. Lessors will continue to classify leases as either operating or finance leases using similar principles as in IAS 17. Therefore, IFRS 16 did not have an impact for leases where the Company is a lessor. The Company adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach with the date of initial application of 1 January 2019. This means that the comparative figures were not restated. _Transition and impact assessment_ Lease contracts that have an impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements relate to office buildings, car fleet, studios, production related leases and office equipment. F-180 ----- In selecting which practical expedients to apply, the Company focused on reducing the complexity of implementation and applied the exemption not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and/or leases with lease terms of less than 12 months.

The effect of the adoption of IFRS 16 had no impact on the Company’s revenue, while Operating result is positively impact by approximately EUR 3 million for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2019. This is caused by the operating lease expenses being replaced by depreciation and interest expenses, of which the latter is not recognized in Operating result. In addition, the cash flow from operating activities for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2019 was positively impact by EUR 21 million, as under the new standard, cash payments for the principal part of the lease liability are classified in the cash flow from financing activities instead of cash flow from operating activities. The Company foresees no impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on compliance with debt covenants. _Leases previously accounted for as operating leases_ The Company recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for those leases previously classified as operating leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Lease liabilities were recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Company is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment under IAS 36. Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include (in-substance) fixed payments (less any lease incentives), variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered of low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Significant judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. When determining the lease term, the Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. These circumstances include the Company’s strategic plans, the industrial footprint of the Company and the importance of the asset to the Company’s operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

As part of that refocus, the decision was made to unwind the operations in Turkey and to liquidate the local operating company in Turkey because of the situation set out below. In May 2017 group management of Endemol Shine discovered serious issues around the local management of Endemol Shine Turkey. Group management has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the business in Istanbul which included an investigation by a local law firm and assistance and advice from independent financial consultants. These investigations revealed EUR 18.2 million of local project-related write-downs and EUR 2.2 million of other local expenses which are all included in the exceptional items. Group management concluded, following the investigation by the law firm, that local management in Turkey did not comply with governance requirements and while every effort was made to find an alternative solution, the only viable option was to file for insolvency of Endemol Shine Turkey. The first hearing in the bankruptcy process took place in 2017 and several hearings have been held since. As of the end of 2017 Audit Administrators were appointed to review and approve all envisaged payments by Endemol Shine Turkey and this panel of Administrators was converted by the court during the hearing of 7 June 2018 to a panel of so-called Management Administrators. The Management Administrators are authorised to represent the company with regard to urgent and financial matters. The Court and the appointed Administrators have made decisions on disbursement of distribution income from exploitation of titles owned by Endemol Shine Turkey, which will reduce outstanding liabilities over time. Financial experts were appointed during the hearing that took place in February 2018 to consider the bankruptcy imminently.

Furthermore, the directors assume that the Company will be able to meet the mandatory repayment terms of the loans and borrowing facilities as described in Note 19. The Company recognized a loss after tax of EUR (145) million (2017: EUR (99) million) and as at that date, current assets exceed current liabilities with EUR 4.4 million. However as described in Note 17 the company’s consolidated statement of financial position reflected a negative equity position of EUR (118) million (2017: EUR 83 million). Although the loss after tax has improved from 2017, a loss in 2018 was imminent as the Company is highly leveraged and therefore incurs high interest costs on the 1st and 2nd lien loans as well as higher foreign exchange losses coupled with an impairment loss of goodwill of EUR 44.1 million. A cash flow forecast for the next 12 months has been prepared by management and is based on the current business plans of the Company. In line with the seasonal pattern of the business, the cash flow forecast shows increased working capital needs in the summer months. The Company expects to have sufficient cash to be able to meet its obligations as they become due in the normal course of business. The directors expect that the shareholder’s facilities, due in December 2019, will be carried forward and that shareholders will continue to give their support as had been done at previous renewal moments. As per 31 December 2018, total drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) amounting to EUR 25 million (2017: EUR 60 million, 2016: EUR 80 million). In 2017, management extended the maturity of the RCF by a year to August 2020. In May 2019, management extended the maturity of the RCF to May 2021. The RCF is part of the wider group financing agreement which covers the 1st Lien and 2nd Lien term debt as well. Considering the value of the company, its business plans and prior experience, the directors expect that the Company will be able to successfully extend or refinance its RCF or broader debt portfolio prior to maturity. Accordingly, no adjustments have been made to the financial statements relating to the recoverability and classification of the assets carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern. At this time, the directors are of the opinion that the assets are likely to be realised at the amount at which they are recorded in the financial statements as at 31 December 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

This presentation is more closely aligned with how profit or loss is presented and managed within the Company. In addition, this presentation is applied by other companies in the industry and will therefore enhance comparability. The comparatives have been restated in line with IAS 8. The impact of the change is disclosed in Note 6 and on the face of the statement of comprehensive income.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
458_2,Offerings 2020.md,1380,CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1380.49,New and amended standards adopted by the group,1380.49.1,,"The Company applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments for the first time for the annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2018. The nature and effect of the changes as a result of adoption of these new accounting standards are described below. Other amendments apply for the first time in 2018, but do not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Note 2.22 discloses the impact of new, revised and amended standards and interpretations not yet applied. a) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; The Company adopted the standard retrospectively, with an initial application date of 1 January 2018. The Company chose to apply the exception in IFRS 9 paragraph 7.2.15 allowing adopters to not restate comparatives F-202 ----- which means that the cumulative impact of the adoption will be recognised in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018. The IFRS 9 classification and measurement requirements for financial assets and liabilities are applicable as of January 1, 2018. Under the new standard, the classification and measurement requirements have no material impact on the company’s financial statements. According to IFRS 9, the classification and measurement of trade receivables, amounts receivable from related companies, financial receivables, loans and borrowings, trade payables and other financial liabilities, are classified as financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost. Derivative assets and liabilities are classified as financial assets and liabilities through profit and loss. The Company performed a detailed calculation of the impact of IFRS 9 in comparison with IAS 39. Considering the nature of the financial instruments the Company currently holds (under assets and liabilities), there is no change to current valuations used (at amortized cost or at fair value). The Company does not hold financial assets that require measurement at fair value with changes in fair value to be recorded through other comprehensive income under IFRS 9. The required accounting of expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets under IFRS 9 mainly pertains to trade receivables and contract assets as per IFRS 15. The Company implemented a simplified approach as permitted under IFRS 9 to calculate the lifetime ECL of these financial assets from initial recognition onwards. The impact on the allowance for impairment losses per 1 January 2018 has been calculated at EUR 3.2 million (increase) excluding deferred tax of EUR 0.8 million. b) IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Company has adopted IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The new accounting policies are set out in note 2.13(a) below. In accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 15, the Company has adopted the modified retrospective approach, as a result of which the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 is recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance as at 1 January 2018. As of 1 January 2018, the adjustment resulting from the transition to IFRS 15 on retained earnings is EUR 6.7 million being EUR 8 million decrease on Revenue and EUR 1.3 million increase in deferred tax liability. The company applied the requirements of the new standard only to contracts that were not complete at 1 January 2018. Application of the new revenue recognition standard has no effect on the cash flows that the Company expects to receive. No other practical expedients were applied for the adoption of IFRS 15. The significant changes from IAS 18/IAS 11 to IFRS 15 are: - Production revenue is recognised on an output method (per episode or milestone reached) rather than a percentage of completion method under IAS 11 - Minimum guarantees are recognised at a point in time as opposed to over time under IAS 18 Set out below, are the amounts by which each financial statement line item is affected as at and for the year ended 31 December 2018 as a result of the adoption of IFRS 15. F-203 ----- Consolidated statement of financial position _EUR 1,000_ The Company has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2017: - Disclosure Initiative Statement of Cash Flows – Amendment to IAS 7; - Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets - Amendment to IAS 12; - Annual improvements to IFRSs 2014 – 2016 cycle. IAS 7 - The amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows require a disclosure of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes such as acquisitions, disposals, accretion of interest and unrealised exchange differences. The Company has included disclosures in tabular format as a reconciliation from opening to closing balances in Note 19 Loans and borrowings. IAS 12- Amendments made to IAS 12 clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. This amendment has no impact on the Company’s financial statements. The adoption of these amendments did not have an impact on the current period or prior period and is not likely to affect future periods. Note 2.26 discloses the impact of new, revised and amended standards and interpretations not yet applied.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. For other long-term employee benefits, such as long-term service benefits, the net obligation is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Short-term employee benefits are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. The company recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and other current employee benefits on an accrual basis. Furthermore, a provision is recognized where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation. Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when Endemol Shine Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when Endemol Shine Group recognises costs for a restructuring.

Where a F-212 ----- contract has multiple performance obligations, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on stand-alone selling prices. This performance obligation will be satisfied over time, since the customer gains control over the produced content at separate moments during the project; or the content produced does not have an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment while the produced content is being transferred. The Company measures the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation based on output methods. The output measurement can either be the delivery of an episode or the reaching of milestones (if specifically stated in the contract). Milestones are considered to be reached once the customer approval has been obtained. If the outcome of a production contract can be estimated reliably, revenue associated with the production are recognised by reference to the stage of completion.

The stage of completion is ordinarily determined with reference to either: - the proportion of finished episodes (to date) to total episodes to be produced under the contract (measurement of stage of completion may be done on the basis of delivery if this is a better measurement); or - the proportion of production days spent (to date) to total production days expected to be made under the contract (mainly applicable for scripted productions like telenovela’s and movies) If the outcome of a production contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent it is probable that expenses incurred are recoverable.

Where the Company has, partially or in full, satisfied the performance obligations but not yet billed the customer, the Company presents the contract as un-invoiced revenue (contract asset), excluding any amounts presented as a trade receivable. The Company capitalizes costs to fulfil a contract only when the costs relate directly to a contract or an anticipated contract that the entity can specifically identify; the costs generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying or continuing to satisfy performance obligations in the future; and the costs are expected to be recovered. These costs are presented as production cost assets and are actual costs incurred for the production. The asset is amortised in line with the satisfaction of the related performance obligation.

The changes mainly affect lessee accounting and generally require lessees to recognize contractual rights and obligations on the lessee’s balance sheet. The standard replaces the straight-line recognition of operating lease expense for those leases applying IAS 17 with the recognition of depreciation expenses for the right-of-use asset and interest expenses on the lease liability (included within the financial result). In addition, IFRS 16 requires more extensive disclosures in the notes for lessees. The standard must be adopted for periods beginning on, or after, 1 January 2019. F-218 ----- The Company will apply the low value and short-term recognition exemptions. The Company will also apply the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components for all classes of leases. The Company will apply the standard from its adoption date on 1 January 2019 and will apply the modified retrospective approach therefore the Company will not restate comparative amounts prior to the first year of adoption. The right-of-use asset will be measured at the amount of the lease liability on adoption. The Company will apply the following practical expedients: for leases ending within 12 months of adoption of IFRS 16 to be treated as short term; exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset; and use hindsight, such as in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company identified the operating leases which are expected to have an impact, and these relate to office buildings, car & truck lease, studio’s, production related leases and office equipment. As at the reporting date, the Company has non-cancellable lease commitments of EUR 176 million (Note 27 Commitments, litigation and other matters). Of these commitments, approximately EUR 2.6 million relates to short-term leases and low value leases which will be recognized on a straight-line basis as expense in profit or loss. Lease agreements entered into do not contain contingent rent payables, significant renewal/purchase/escalation options/restrictions. For the remaining lease commitments, after the impact of discounting, the Company expects to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of EUR 151 million on 1 January 2019. The Company expects that EBITDA will increase, as operating lease payments were included in EBITDA, but the depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on the lease liability are excluded from this measure. The Company’s activities as a lessor are not material and hence the Company does not expect any significant impact on the financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The transaction closed in January 2018. The Company contributed its Latino activities with an equity value of EUR 2.5m into the newly founded company Endemol Shine Boomdog LLC (“ES Boomdog Miami”). 49% of the shares in ES Boomdog Miami were sold to Boomdog US Inc., a 100% subsidiary of BDF Productions. In exchange BDF Productions gave up 51% in Endemol Shine Boomdog Holding S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“ES Boomdog Mexico”). ES Boomdog Mexico, a newly formed entity, holds a 100% interest in Boomdog Films (now Endemol Shine Boomdog S.A.P.I. de C.V.) and Boomdog Studios S.A.P.I. de C.V..

This will also be the measurement date going forward. In 2017, the goodwill test was performed at 31 December 2017. The Company considers the development of the WACCs, peer group information and the realisation of the operating results of its CGUs versus budgeted amounts and market multiples as key factors when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The recoverable amounts of CGUs have been determined based on fair value less costs of disposal calculations. The financial projections cover a period of five years. The key assumptions used for the fair value less cost of disposal calculations relate to discount rate and terminal value growth rate, revenue growth and EBITDA margin. The financial projections are derived from the 2019 Budget and 2020 business plan and forward-looking statements as approved by management taken into account various downside adjustments. The projections include estimates for the cost savings that have been realized and are to be realized from several cost and procurement saving initiatives. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties as they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Accordingly, actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may differ from those assumed in the forward-looking statements. This impairment test is considered to be a level 3 assessment. The post-tax discount rates, applied to the cash flow projections, vary between 6.4% and 11.7% (December 2017: 6.6% and 11.5%). These rates have been calculated using the weighted average cost of capital methodology. The main parameters are the targeted debt-to-equity ratio, the risk-free interest rate based on government bonds and a risk premium. The terminal value growth rate is based on the risk-free rate for all Euro denominated CGU’s or the risk-free rate plus inflation differential for other CGU’s. The revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and the Company’s expectations for growth rates and EBITDA margins achievable in the markets the Company is active in. Consolidated for the Company, the average annual compounded revenue growth rate applied for the forecast period financial year 2019-2023 is 2.5%. The average annual compounded revenue growth rate applied for the main CGU’s ranged between 0.0% and 8.4%. Consolidated for the Company the terminal value year EBITDA margin applied is 9.0%. The terminal value year EBITDA margins applied for the main CGU’s ranged between 7.4% and 20.3%. Consolidated for the Company the terminal value growth rate applied is 0.5%. The terminal value growth rate applied for the main CGU’s ranged between 0.4% and 1.3%. The impairment test led to the conclusion that there was an impairment required for the CGU France following the market deterioration and subsequently revision of the forecast for the year 2019-2022 in May 2019. The impairment for CGU France of EUR 44.1 million, which was not recorded in the consolidated financial statements of MediArena Acquisition BV, is mainly driven by significantly lower than anticipated performance in the year 2019 mainly for the non-scripted business. The impairment charge of EUR 44.1 million has been reported in the statement of comprehensive income. The recoverable amount of the CGU France is EUR 38.9 million as per 31 December 2018. In addition to the forecast used in the impairment test, a sensitivity analysis has been prepared. In the scenario of using a 50 bps higher discount rate, this would lead to recognizing a total additional impairment charge of F-228 ----- EUR (25) million for the CGU International & Distribution. A 5% lower terminal value EBITDA growth level would lead to recognizing a total additional impairment of EUR (10) million for the CGU International & Distribution. The following table illustrates for the CGUs with limited headroom the sensitivity to changes in the terminal value EBITDA which would result in a recoverable amount equal to the carrying amount and the headroom based on current projections:",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The goodwill allocated at the measurement date was € 1,131 million (Dec 2017: € 1,180 million). The movement of the goodwill amount between measurement date and 31 December 2018 was due to foreign exchange differences and the impairment recognized for CGU France. There were no changes to the methodology of goodwill allocation to CGUs except for the goodwill of Belgium (€ 8 million) which is now part of the CGU Netherlands instead of the CGU Northern Europe. The transfer of the CGU Belgium to the CGU The Netherlands is due to a change in management structure. In 2018, a CEO has been appointed to manage both the Netherlands and Belgium business and as a result the Belgium activities have been integrated in activities in the Netherlands including key account management. The CGU structure has been set-up on the basis of materiality of the operating companies and in order to align with the reporting and responsibility structure.

This level 3 assessment led to the conclusion that an impairment was required for an amount of EUR (19.8) million, for the CGU France. An additional impairment charge was incurred for the CGU Rest of World in the amount of EUR (5.8) million, EUR (5.2) million including FX. An impairment charge of EUR (25.6) million was reported in the statement of comprehensive income. The impairment for CGU France was mainly driven by lower performance in the year and lower forward projections in especially the non-scripted business. In Rest of the World, the company refocused its regional strategy in some markets. As part of that refocus, the decision was made to unwind the operations in Turkey and to liquidate the local operating company in Turkey. F-230 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

(formerly known as AP NMT Acquisition B.V.), as borrower, MediArena Newco B.V. (formerly AP NMT Newco B.V.), the borrower’s direct parent company, and certain financial institutions entered into a First Lien Credit Agreement and a Second Lien Credit Agreement. On 12 December 2014, to finance the Shine transaction, MediArena Acquisition B.V. also entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement. Together these provide for: a EUR 125 million First Lien multi-currency revolving credit facility (“RCF”), which also facilitates a letter of credit sub-facility and a EUR 30 million swing line loan sub-facility. On 22 December 2017, the maturity date of the RCF was extended to 13 August 2020 (previously 13 August 2019). In May 2019, management extended the maturity of the RCF to May 2021. As per 31 December 2018, total drawings under the RCF amounting to EUR 25.0 million were outstanding (2017: EUR 60.0 million); a First Lien Term Loan B facility maturing on 13 August 2021, comprised of a USD 885 million tranche of First Lien Term B loans, a EUR 235 million tranche of First Lien Term B loans and a GBP 50 million tranche of First Lien Term B loans; and a USD 457 million Second Lien Term Loan B facility maturing on 13 August 2022. On 22 April 2015, MediArena Acquisition B.V. entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement providing for: an additional USD 25 million First Lien Term Loan B loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement, which also matures on 13 August 2021; and an additional EUR 25 million First Lien Term Loan B loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement, which also matures on 13 August 2021. The loans incurred on 12 December 2014 and 22 April 2015 have the same terms as the loans of the same currency incurred under the First Lien Credit Agreement on 13 August 2014. In addition, the Group may request one or more incremental term loan facilities and/or increase commitments under its First Lien Credit Agreement and request one or more incremental term loan facilities under its Second Lien Agreement in an aggregate amount of up to the sum of EUR 100 million plus such additional amount as long as, (i) in the case of loans under additional credit facilities that rank equally to the liens on the collateral securing the Term B Loans and the Initial Revolving Loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement, its consolidated net first lien leverage ratio would be no greater than 3.40 to 1.00 and (ii) in the case of loans under additional credit facilities that rank junior to the liens on the collateral securing the Term B Loans and the Initial Revolving Loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement and equally and without preference with, or junior to, the liens on the collateral securing the Term Loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement, its consolidated net secured leverage ratio would be no greater than 5.20 to 1.00, subject to certain conditions and receipt of commitments by existing or additional lenders. F-237 ----- All borrowings under the Group’s revolving credit facility under the First Lien Credit Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default and the accuracy of representations and warranties. Prior to the maturity date of 13 August 2021, the First Lien Term B Loans require scheduled quarterly amortization payments in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans, the first payment of which was due on 31 December 2014, with the balance due at maturity. In 2018, amortization payments of EUR 10.9 million were made (2017: EUR 11.1 million). Amortization payments due in 2019 amount to EUR 11.1 million. Within the context of the financing agreements, guarantees and securities have been provided by several of Endemol Shine’s entities established in the Security Jurisdictions (United States, England and Wales, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain and Australia) and guarantees have been provided by certain Endemol Shine entities established in Italy, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Borrowings of term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement with a base rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) are subject to a 1.00% floor. The First Lien Credit Agreement includes customary mandatory prepayment requirements based on certain events, such as asset sales, certain debt issuances and defined levels of excess cash flow. The Second Lien Credit Agreement includes customary mandatory prepayment requirements based on certain events, such as asset sales, certain debt issuances and defined levels of excess cash flow. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty and subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR rate loans. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement at any time. All prepayments will be subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans. The Revolving Facility requires that the financial maintenance covenant be tested as of the last day of any quarter if as of such time any revolving facility loans, swingline loans or letters of credit are outstanding (excluding letters of credit other than letters of credit supporting debt for borrowed money). With respect to the Revolving Facility only, the covenant requires the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio not to exceed 5.50 to 1.00; provided that, solely to the extent that conditions relating to available capacity under certain Indebtedness, lien, investment and restricted payment baskets (the so-called financial covenant stepdown conditions) are not satisfied at any time when the Revolving Facility may be drawn, the net first lien leverage ratio would be reduced from a ratio equal to 5.50 to 1.00 to a ratio equal to 3.00 to 1.00. As of 31 December 2018, borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility; therefore, the covenant was in effect. The First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement also contain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, and the negative covenants limit the Group’s ability to, among other things: incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; create liens on assets; make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of its capital stock or make other restricted payments; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; enter into certain transactions with its affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; change its lines of business; restrict dividends from its subsidiaries or restrict liens; change its fiscal year; and modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Additionally, the number of participants in the GIP has been reduced. The value creation is measured by the growth in consolidated group trading EBITDA -/- cash Exceptional charges, measured over the Plan period. The GIP period covers the period 2018 – 2020. The GIP will payout in March 2021 (50%) and the remaining 50% in March 2022, to only participants who are still employed at the moment of the respective payments. If there is no or limited growth of earnings over the GIP period, the GIP is out of the money. The GIP amount is calculated as a percentage of the participant salaries, with a maximum expected payout of EUR 18.8 million. The GIP has a so called “lock-in mechanism” for 2018, which means that the 2018 achievement is locked-in if the 2018 target is achieved. The 2018 results are above the hurdles set in the GIP plan and therefore executives participating in the GIP are eligible for payout of the 2018 participation value in 2021 and 2022. As per the end of 2018 only the LTIP for the UK is still active and therefore these executives have not moved to the GIP yet. Selected executives will be moving to the GIP in 2019, as the LTIP is finalized in 2018. All other LTIPs were settled in 2018. The GIP is in substance considered a profit-sharing arrangement and are accounted for as an employee benefit in accordance with IAS 19. The expenses in connection with such plans are attributed to the period in which the services that give rise to the obligation are rendered. Therefore 50% is attributed to the period January 2018 – March 2021 and 50% is attributed to the period January 2018 – March 2022. In terms of the GIP, the Company only accounts for GIP expenses in any given period if it is management’s best estimate as of the end of that period that the plan will be “in the money” and the bonus payable can be estimated reliably.

For the valuation of RSU’s granted during the year 2018, the main assumptions are: - Valuation date: 1 May 2018 - Vesting date: January 1 - expected option life: 0.67 years / 1.67 years - share price at grant date: USD 35.46 - expected share price volatility of the company’s shares: 26.3% / 25.3% - risk-free interest rate: 2.06% (0.67 year US government bond) / 2.45% (1.67 year US government bond) - expected dividends: 0% Set out below is a summary of the grant dates of the new RSU plan: Number of RSU As of 31 December 2017 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **— Granted 2018 RSU’s . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 565,000 Forfeited during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — The Equity Incentive Plan is designed to provide long-term incentives for eligible management to deliver long-term shareholder returns. Participation in the plan is at the board’s discretion. Under the plan, participants are granted options to purchase shares of common stock of JV Newco. 25% of the granted options will vest ratably over five years (service based vesting tranche), and 75% of the granted options will vest only at the occurrence of a realization event (Performance based vesting tranches): - 25% will vest only on the occurrence of a realization event, but only if JV Newco shareholders receive cash proceeds of at least two times (2.0x) their aggregate investment in JV Newco - 25% will vest only on the occurrence of a realization event, but only if the “JV Newco” shareholders receive cash proceeds of at least two and a half times (2.5x) their aggregate investment in JV Newco - 25% will vest only on the occurrence of a realization event, but only if JV Newco shareholders receive cash proceeds of at least three times (3.0x) their aggregate investment in JV Newco. The option grant has a 10 year term with an exercise period of 5 years after the final vesting date for the service based tranche. A “realization event” means the occurrence of certain sales of JV Newco shares by JV Newco shareholders, certain transfers of JV Newco assets or a liquidation of JV Newco. Options are granted under the plan for no consideration and carry no dividend or voting rights. When exercisable, each option is convertible into one ordinary share. The exercise price of options is based on the initial price paid by the shareholders for their shares in JV Newco. As the awards granted under the plan are equity-settled share-based payment awards, the grant date fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.

JV Newco maintains risk management control systems to monitor foreign currency risk attributable to both outstanding foreign currency positions and commitments, as well as offsetting hedge positions. The risk management control systems involve the centralisation of JV Newco’s foreign currency exposure management, the netting and offsetting exposures from different group companies and the use of analytical techniques, including sensitivity analysis, to estimate the expected impact of changes in foreign currency rates. JV Newco group companies enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the group company concerned. Significant transactions and operations in foreign currency, that could materially impact JV Newco’s statement of financial position and profit and loss, occur mainly in USD and GBP. These transactions expose JV Newco to foreign currency results. By means of natural hedging as well as foreign currency forward contracts JV Newco minimises exchange results on receivables, payables and expected future cash-flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Financial derivatives can be used to economically hedge the net exchange results due to changes in foreign currency rates. Effective 8 January 2015, the Company entered into a EUR 350.0 million for USD 412 million Cross Currency Swap (CCS), at spot rate USD/EUR 1.177. The CCS partly offsets the mismatch between the currency mix of the external loans and borrowings and the currency mix of EBITDA and cash flow and in addition converts the company’s floating interest obligation in respect of 60% of the principal amount of the EUR-denominated loans to a fixed rate. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in the income statement as fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments and (partially) offset the exchange results recognised as foreign exchange results on the assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. It is JV Newco’s policy to settle foreign currency forward contracts within the reporting period. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar and British pound exchange rate, with all variables held constant, of JV Newco’s equity and result before tax. The calculations are based on current year’s results and year end positions in USD and GBP.

Effective 8 January 2015, the Company entered into a EUR 350.0 million for USD 412 million Cross Currency Swap (CCS), at spot rate USD/EUR 1.177. The CCS partly off sets the mismatch between the currency mix of the external loans and borrowings and the currency mix of EBITDA and cash flow and in addition converts the company’s floating interest obligation in respect of 60% of the principal amount of the EUR-denominated loans to a fixed rate. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in the income statement as fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments and (partially) offset the exchange results recognised as foreign exchange results on the assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. It is JV Newco’s policy to settle foreign currency forward contracts within the reporting period. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar and British pound exchange rate, with all variables held constant, of JV Newco’s equity and result before tax. The calculations are based on current year’s results and year end positions in USD and GBP.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

On 23 September 2016, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed (i.e., approved) the bankruptcy plan proposed by the CORE Debtors. The plan provides for a significant de-leveraging of the CORE Debtors pursuant to which, among other things, holders of equity interests in the CORE Debtors (including CORE Entertainment Holdings’ equity interest in CORE Entertainment, Inc.) did not receive any distribution on account thereof. Under the CORE Debtors’ bankruptcy plan, unsecured creditors are entitled to share pro rata in a distribution of cash (up to USD 2,375,000 in the aggregate and not to exceed 10% of its unsecured claim) and certain residual rights in respect of actions brought against parties not released from claims under the plan. On December 12, 2016, a litigation trust (the “Litigation Trust”) that was created in connection with the bankruptcy of CORE Media, Inc. and several of its affiliates (collectively, “Core”) filed a lawsuit in the State Courts in California in the United States, against certain Apollo companies, 21CF companies and JV Newco entities. As part of the Core’s plan of reorganization, the Litigation Trust was assigned the legal claims previously belonging to various entities which loaned money to Core. In 2017, the court in California ruled in favour of a motion filed by the Company to stay the Core Litigation in California to force it to be refiled in New York. Accordingly, later in 2017, the Litigation Trust filed a new lawsuit in the State Courts in New York. The complaint alleges that the defendants, including the Company, intentionally interfered with loan agreements reached between Core and its lenders. The lawsuit also claims that certain defendants, including AP NMT JV Newco B.V. but not including the Company, are liable for Core’s breach of its loan agreements by virtue of the alter ego doctrine and/or the de facto merger doctrine. Litigation Trust is seeking both compensatory and punitive damage in an undetermined amount against each of the 21 defendants it has named in the litigation, including MediArena Holding B.V., Reveille, LLC, AP NMT JV Newco B.V., Endemol USA, Inc., and Endemol USA Holding, Inc. The Company has indicated that it intends to vigorously defend its rights. The Company and each of the Endemol Shine entities named in the lawsuit have filed a Motion to Dismiss the lawsuit. Those Motions were argued in May 2018 and are awaiting decision. A new Judge has been appointed and the motion may need to be heard again. Based on management’s current consideration of the facts and circumstances, no provision has been recorded. On April 27, 2018, the Litigation Trust filed two lawsuits in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”), both of which identified certain JV Newco entities as defendants. The first lawsuit in the Bankruptcy Court names as defendants certain Apollo entities and individuals, Core Entertainment Holdings, Inc., and AP NMT JV Newco B.V. That lawsuit makes claims against various entities for breach of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duties, and fraudulent transfer. On August 23, 2018, the Litigation Trust filed a Notice of Dismissal which voluntarily dismissed AP NMT JV Newco B.V. from this lawsuit without prejudice. The case remains ongoing against the remaining defendants, none of which are JV Newco entities. The second lawsuit in the Bankruptcy Court names Endemol USA Holding, Inc. and Endemol USA, Inc. as defendants. The complaint sought to avoid the transfer of international distribution rights to The Wall to Endemol and brought claims for actual and constructive fraudulent transfer. The Litigation Trust seeks compensatory damages in an unspecified amount. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on July 13, 2018. The F-249 ----- Court granted that Motion on November 13, 2018, but granted the Litigation Trust thirty days to amend its complaint. The Litigation Trust filed an Amended Complaint on December 13, 2018, asserting causes of action for conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, and imposition of a constructive trust. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on January 25, 2019, and briefing related to that Motion is ongoing. The JV Newco entities named in the lawsuit have indicated that they intend to vigorously defend their rights. Motions were argued in May, 2018 and are awaiting decision.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

These investigations revealed EUR 18.2 million of local project-related write-downs and EUR 2.2 million of other local expenses which are all included in the exceptional items. Group management concluded, following the investigation by the law firm, that local management in Turkey did not comply with governance requirements and while every effort was made to find an alternative solution, the only viable option was to file for insolvency of Endemol Shine Turkey.

For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the smallest identifiable cash-generating unit. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent years. Except for goodwill, JV Newco assesses in subsequent years whether indications exist that impairment losses previously recognised for non-current assets may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of that asset (or cash generating unit) is recalculated and its carrying amount is increased to the revised recoverable amount. The increase is recognised in the income F-288 ----- statement. A reversal is recognised only if it arises from a change in the assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which JV Newco pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. JV Newco’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for JV Newco, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements. Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. JV Newco determines the net interest expense F-289 ----- (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. JV Newco recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. For other long-term employee benefits, such as long-term service benefits, the net obligation is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when JV Newco can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when JV Newco recognises costs for a restructuring.

JV Newco measures all derivative financial instruments based on fair values, derived from market prices or a valuation model. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. JV Newco designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge). JV Newco F-294 ----- documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. JV Newco also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within ‘Net financial income (expense)’. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.

A new five step approach must be applied before revenue can be recognised: - Identify contracts with customers; - Identify the separate performance obligations; - Determine the transaction price of the contract; - Allocate the transaction price to each of the separate performance obligations; and - Recognise the revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The effects of applying the new standard on the Company’s financial statements has been assessed. An impact has been identified for the revenue recognition of contracts with customers containing a performance obligation to produce content. Revenue will be recognised when control has been transferred to the customer. Revenue from production services will be recognised over time based on clearly stated milestones, being milestones as stated in the contract with the customer or delivery of an episode rather than a variance of milestones. The Company has not identified revenue recognition changes from revenue of other income categories. The Company identified contracts with a revenue amounting to EUR 47 million and EBITDA of EUR 8 million in 2017 that will phase into 2018. The Company expects a similar effect from 2018 to 2019. As a result, the impact on the 2018 EBITDA is expected to be limited. IFRS 15 will be applied for the first time in the financial year 2018. The Company intends to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach, which means that the cumulative impact of the adoption will be recognised in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018 and that comparatives will not be restated. IFRS 9 – The final version of IFRS 9 contains revised regulations for the classifications and measurement of financial assets, new requirements for impairment of financial instruments and new requirements for hedge accounting. The Company performed a high level assessment of the impact of IFRS 9 in comparison with IAS 39. Considering the nature of the financial instruments the Company currently holds (under assets and liabilities), we expect no significant change to current valuations used (at amortized cost or at fair value). The Company does not hold financial assets that require measurement at fair value with changes in fair value to be recorded through other comprehensive income under IFRS 9. The required accounting of expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets under IFRS 9 mainly pertains to trade receivables and contract assets as per IFRS 15. The Company intends to implement a simplified approach as permitted under IFRS 9 to calculate the lifetime ECL of these financial assets from initial recognition onwards. The provision matrix will be based on the Company’s historical default rates, adjusted for forward looking estimates. IFRS 9 will be applied for the first time in the financial year 2018. The impact on the allowance for impairment losses per 1 January 2018 has been calculated at EUR 1.8 million (increase). The Company intends to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach, which means that the cumulative impact of the adoption will be recognised in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018 and that comparatives will not be restated. IFRS 16 – The new standard sets out principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for leases. The changes mainly affect lessee accounting and generally require lessees to recognize contractual rights and obligations on the lessee’s balance sheet. The standard replaces the straightline recognition of operating lease expense for those leases applying IAS 17 with the recognition of depreciation expenses for the right-of-use asset and interest expenses on the lease liability (included within the financial result). In addition, IFRS 16 includes more extensive disclosures in the notes for lessees. The new standard will have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Company. As at the reporting date, the Company has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of EUR 148.5 million, see note 27. The Company estimates that less than 10% of these relate to payments for short-term and low value leases which will be recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. However, the Company has not yet assessed what other adjustments, if any, are necessary for example because of the change in the definition of the lease term and the different treatment of variable lease payments and of extension and termination options. It is therefore not yet possible to estimate the amount of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that will have to be recognised on adoption of the new standard and how this may affect the group’s profit or loss and classification of cash flows going forward. F-296 ----- Examples of leases where the new standard will have an impact are leases for the rental of buildings and studio’s. The standard will be applied for the first time in the financial year 2019. An assessment of the impact on the financial statements of the Company will be made in 2018. IFRIC 22 – The interpretation clarifies how to determine the date of transaction for the exchange rate to be used on initial recognition of a related asset, expense or income where an entity pays or receives consideration in advance for foreign currency-denominated contracts. For a single payment or receipt, the date of the transaction should be the date on which the entity initially recognises the non-monetary asset or liability arising from the advance consideration (the prepayment or deferred income/contract liability). If there are multiple payments or receipts for one item, a date of transaction should be determined as above for each payment or receipt. Entities can choose to apply the interpretation: - retrospectively for each period presented; - prospectively to items in scope that are initially recognised on or after the beginning of the reporting period in which the interpretation is first applied, or; - prospectively from the beginning of a prior reporting period presented as comparative information. The Company intends to apply the second option.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

On 23 September 2016, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed (i.e., approved) the bankruptcy plan proposed by the CORE Debtors. The plan provided for a significant de-leveraging of the CORE Debtors pursuant to which, among other things, holders of equity interests in the CORE Debtors (including CORE Entertainment Holdings’ equity interest in CORE Entertainment, Inc.) did not receive any distribution on account thereof. As such, JV Newco’s indirect equity interest in CORE Media Group was cancelled for no consideration. Under the CORE Debtors’ bankruptcy plan, unsecured creditors were entitled to share pro rata in a distribution of cash (up to USD 2,375,000 in the aggregate and not to exceed 10% of its unsecured claim) and certain residual rights in respect of actions brought against parties not released from claims under the plan. As a legal matter, JV Newco remained the controlling stockholder of CORE Entertainment Holdings Inc. with the authority to appoint a majority of the board of directors. However, upon the CORE Debtors’ emergence from bankruptcy on 17 October 2016, CORE Entertainment Holdings Inc.’s shares in CORE Entertainment Inc. were cancelled such that CORE Entertainment Holdings Inc. no longer owns CORE Entertainment Inc. or any of its subsidiaries nor has the right to manage CORE’s business. This resulted in a loss of control over CORE’s business and triggered an immediate deconsolidation from the consolidated balance sheet of JV Newco per date of loss of control. Since CORE’s business was a separate cash generating unit within JV Newco’s operations, the disposal of CORE Media Group has been accounted for and presented as discontinued operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

458_2,Offerings 2020.md,1380,CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,1380.497,Annual test for impairment,1380.497.1,,"During the financial period 2017, the Company assessed the recoverable amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, based on a detailed forecast per CGU taking into account various downside adjustments to the detailed business plans. This level 3 assessment leads to the conclusion that an impairment was required for an amount of EUR (18.6) million, for the CGU France. An additional impairment charge was incurred for the CGU Rest of World in the amount of EUR (5.8) million, EUR (5.2) million including FX. An impairment charge of EUR (24.4) million has been reported in the statement of comprehensive income. Impairment CGU France is mainly driven by lower performance in the year and lower forward projections in especially the non-scripted business. In Rest of the World, JV Newco is refocusing its regional strategy in some markets. As part of that refocus, the decision was made to unwind the operations in Turkey and to liquidate the local operating company in Turkey. Goodwill of the cash generating units has been tested for impairment at year-end 2017 based on the latest short- and long-term business forecasts. The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units have been determined based on a fair value less cost of disposal approach. To determine the fair value less cost of disposal, cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and forward-looking statements, approved by senior management, for the underlying operations of a cash generating unit. These projections include estimates for the cost savings that have been realized and are to be realized from several cost savings initiatives. F-306 ----- By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties as they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Accordingly, actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may differ from those assumed in the forward-looking statements. The key assumptions used for the fair value less cost of disposal calculations relate to discount rate and terminal value growth rate, revenue growth and EBITDA margin. The post-tax discount rates, applied to the cash flow projections, vary between 6.6% and 11.5%. These rates have been calculated using the weighted average cost of capital methodology. The main parameters are the targeted debt-to-equity ratio, the risk-free interest rate based on government bonds and a risk premium. The terminal value growth rate is based on the lower of i) the risk-free rate for all Euro denominated CGU’s or the risk free rate plus inflation differential for other CGU’s, and ii) the estimated local long-term inflation expectation. The revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and our expectations for growth rates and EBITDA margins achievable in the markets the Company is active in. Consolidated for the Company the average annual compounded revenue growth rate applied in the projected periods is 2.4%. The average annual compounded revenue growth rate applied for the main CGU’s ranged between 1.1% and 6.9%. Consolidated for the Company the terminal value year EBITDA margin applied is 9.65%. The terminal value year EBITDA margins applied for the main CGU’s ranged between 6.4% and 24.2%. Consolidated for the Company the terminal value growth rate applied is 1.04%. The terminal value growth rate applied for the main CGU’s ranged between 0.6% and 1.4%. In addition to the forecast used in the impairment test, a sensitivity analysis has been prepared. In the scenario of using a 50 bps higher discount rate, this would lead to recognizing a total impairment charge of EUR (58) million, of which EUR (28) million would relate to the CGU France and EUR (30) million would relate to the CGU International & Distribution. A 5% lower terminal value EBITDA level would lead to recognizing a total impairment of EUR (44) million, of which EUR (25) million would relate to the CGU France and EUR (19) million would relate to the CGU International & Distribution. The following table illustrates for the CGUs with limited headroom the sensitivity to changes in the terminal value EBITDA which would result in a recoverable amount equal to the carrying amount and the headroom based on current projections:",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

(formerly known as AP NMT Acquisition B.V.), as borrower, MediArena Newco B.V. (formerly AP NMT Newco B.V.), the borrower’s direct parent company, and certain financial institutions entered into a First Lien Credit Agreement and a Second Lien Credit Agreement. On 12 December 2014, to finance the Shine transaction, MediArena Acquisition B.V. also entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement. Together providing for: - a EUR 125 million First Lien multi-currency revolving credit facility (“RCF”), which also facilitates a letter of credit sub-facility and a EUR 30 million swing line loan sub-facility. On 22 December 2017, the maturity date of the RCF was extended to 13 August 2020 (previously 13 August 2019). As per 31 December 2017, total drawings under the RCF amounting to EUR 60.0 million were outstanding (2016: EUR 80.0 million); - a First Lien Term Loan B facility maturing on 13 August 2021, comprised of a USD 885 million tranche of First Lien Term B loans, a EUR 235 million tranche of First Lien Term B loans and a GBP 50 million tranche of First Lien Term B loans; and - a USD 457 million Second Lien Term Loan B facility maturing on 13 August 2022. On 22 April 2015, MediArena Acquisition B.V. entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement providing for: - an additional USD 25 million First Lien Term Loan B loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement, which also matures on 13 August 2021; and - an additional EUR 25 million First Lien Term Loan B loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement, which also matures on 13 August 2021. The loans incurred on 12 December 2014 and 22 April 2015 have the same terms as the loans of the same currency incurred under the First Lien Credit Agreement on 13 August 2014. In addition, the Group may request one or more incremental term loan facilities and/or increase commitments under its First Lien Credit Agreement and request one or more incremental term loan facilities under its Second Lien Agreement in an aggregate amount of up to the sum of EUR 100 million plus such additional amount as long as, (i) in the case of loans under additional credit facilities that rank equally to the liens on the collateral securing the Term B Loans and the Initial Revolving Loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement, its consolidated net first lien leverage ratio would be no greater than 3.40 to 1.00 and (ii) in the case of loans under additional credit facilities that rank junior to the liens on the collateral securing the Term B Loans and the Initial Revolving Loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement and equally and without preference with, or junior to, the liens on the collateral securing the Term Loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement, its consolidated net secured leverage ratio would be no greater than 5.20 to 1.00, subject to certain conditions and receipt of commitments by existing or additional lenders. All borrowings under the Group’s revolving credit facility under the First Lien Credit Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default and the accuracy of representations and warranties. Prior to the maturity date of 13 August 2021, the First Lien Term B Loans require scheduled quarterly amortization payments in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans, the first payment of which was due on 31 December 2014, with the balance due at maturity. In 2017, amortization payments of EUR 11.1 million were made (2016: EUR 11.5 million). Amortization payments due in 2018 amount to EUR 10.7 million. Within the context of the financing agreements, guarantees and securities have been provided by several of Endemol Shine’s entities established in the Security Jurisdictions (United States, England and Wales, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain and Australia) and guarantees have been provided by certain Endemol Shine Group entities established in Italy, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Borrowings of term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement at a base rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) are subject to a 1.00% floor. The First Lien Credit Agreement includes customary mandatory prepayment requirements based on certain events, such as asset sales, certain debt issuances and defined levels of excess cash flow. The Second Lien Credit Agreement includes customary mandatory prepayment requirements based on certain events, such as asset sales and certain debt issuances. F-315 ----- The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty and subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR rate loans. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement at any time. All prepayments will be subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans. Initially the revolving credit facility under the First Lien Credit Agreement included a springing financial maintenance covenant that required the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio not to exceed 5.50 to 1.00. The covenant would be tested quarterly when the revolving credit facility was more than 30% drawn (excluding outstanding letters of credit other than letters of credit supporting debt for borrowed money). As of 31 December 2016, the borrowings under the revolving credit facility were more than 30% of the outstanding commitments; therefore, the covenant was in effect. The amendment of the Revolving Facility requires that the covenant be tested quarterly at any time if as of such time any revolving facility loans, swingline loans or letters of credit are outstanding. With respect to the Revolving Facility only, the covenant requires the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio not to exceed 5.50 to 1.00; provided that, solely to the extent that certain financial covenant stepdown conditions are not satisfied at any time when the revolver may be drawn, the net first lien leverage ratio shall be reduced from a ratio equal to 5.50 to 1.00 to a ratio equal to 3.00 to 1.00. As of 31 December 2017, borrowings were made under the revolving credit facility; therefore, the covenant was in effect. The First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement also contain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, and the negative covenants limit the Group’s ability to, among other things: incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; create liens on assets; make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of its capital stock or make other restricted payments; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; enter into certain transactions with its affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; change its lines of business; restrict dividends from its subsidiaries or restrict liens; change its fiscal year; and modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

In the Netherlands, Endemol participates in a defined benefit plan for nearly all employees in the Netherlands at Stichting Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor de Media PNO (“PNO Media”). This plan is a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan, which is accounted for as a defined contribution plan because sufficient information for defined benefit accounting is not available. PNO Media is a multiemployer pension fund and PNO Media is not able to provide Endemol with sufficient information on the present value of the benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets and the funded status of Endemol. As of 31 December 2017, PNO Media had a coverage ratio of 102.0% (2016: 91.3%), which is below the required ratio by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) of 122.0%. In March 2017 PNO Media submitted its latest updated of a recovery plan at the Dutch National Bank, including the measures to be taken in order to get the coverage ratio at the required level within the next 10 years. As long as the actual coverage ratio is below the required coverage ratio, the recovery plan will be updated by PNO Media annually. In Italy, employees are covered by a severance plan (post-employment benefit plan) provided for in accordance with local legislation. Severance pay is considered normal remuneration that has been deferred and approximates one month’s pay for each year of service, valued each year on a basis linked to cost-of-living indices.

For the key executives within certain local operations a local LTIP was introduced running for a 4 to 5-year period. All bonus payments under the LTIPs (if any) will be made in cash. The LTIPs are aimed to align the interests of the stakeholders with the participating executives by virtue of sharing part of the value created of the relevant Group entities. The value creation is predominantly driven by a growth in applicable earnings measured over the relevant LTIP period. If there is no or limited growth of earnings over the LTIP period, the LTIPs are not in the money. The LTIP plans provide for an advance payment of 30% of the estimated total cash bonus payable at the end of the LTIP period (if any) to each participant in the course of 3rd year of the 5-year plan period. The remainder (if any) will be paid upon settlement of the LTIPs. For the local LTIPs effective at 31 December 2017, the total cash bonus payments over the LTIP period are capped at EUR 75 million (2016: capped at EUR 77 million). In 2018 new LTIP-arrangements will become effective, triggering settlement in 2018 of some of the LTIPobligations as accrued per 31 December 2017 under the initial LTIP-arrangements (included in current part). The LTIPs are in substance considered profit-sharing arrangements and are accounted for as an employee benefit in accordance with IAS 19. The expenses in connection with such plans are attributed to the period in which the services that give rise to the obligation are rendered. In terms of the LTIP, the Company only accounts for LTIP expenses in any given period if it is management’s best estimate as of the end of that period that the plan will be “in the money” and the bonus payable can be estimated reliably. The “in the money” assessment is primarily made with reference to whether or not a certain targeted earnings measure has been achieved during the respective financial period.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

On 23 September 2016, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed (i.e., approved) the bankruptcy plan proposed by the CORE Debtors. The F-327 ----- plan provides for a significant de-leveraging of the CORE Debtors pursuant to which, among other things, holders of equity interests in the CORE Debtors (including CORE Entertainment Holdings’ equity interest in CORE Entertainment, Inc.) did not receive any distribution on account thereof. Under the CORE Debtors’ bankruptcy plan, unsecured creditors are entitled to share pro rata in a distribution of cash (up to USD 2,375,000 in the aggregate and not to exceed 10% of its unsecured claim) and certain residual rights in respect of actions brought against parties not released from claims under the plan. On December 12, 2016, a litigation trust (the “Litigation Trust”) that was created in connection with the bankruptcy of CORE Media, Inc. and several of its affiliates (collectively, “Core”) filed a lawsuit in the State Courts in California in the United States, against certain Apollo companies, 21CF companies and JV Newco entities. As part of the Core’s plan of reorganization, the Litigation Trust was assigned the legal claims previously belonging to various entities which loaned money to Core. In 2017, the court in California ruled in favour of a motion filed by the Company to stay the Core Litigation in California to force it to be refiled in New York. Accordingly, later in 2017, the Litigation Trust filed a new lawsuit in the State Courts in New York. The complaint alleges that the defendants, including the Company, intentionally interfered with loan agreements reached between Core and its lenders. The lawsuit also claims that certain defendants, including AP NMT JV Newco B.V., are liable for Core’s breach of its loan agreements by virtue of the alter ego doctrine and/or the de facto merger doctrine. Litigation Trust is seeking both compensatory and punitive damage in an undetermined amount against each of the 21 defendants it has named in the litigation, including MediArena Holding B.V., Reveille, LLC, AP NMT JV Newco B.V., Endemol USA, Inc., and Endemol USA Holding, Inc. The Company has indicated that it intends to vigorously defend its rights. The Company and each of the JV Newco entities named in the lawsuit have filed a Motions to Dismiss the lawsuit, which are currently pending.

IAS 38 Intangible Assets now includes a rebuttable presumption that the amortisation of intangible assets based on revenue is inappropriate. The Company amortises intangible assets using a declining balance method based on the expected consumption of economic benefits from these assets. Therefore, the amendment of IAS 38 has no impact on the amortisation method of the Company’s intangible assets. The adoption of these amendments did not have an impact on the current period or prior period and is not likely to affect future periods.

Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

JV Newco uses market observable data (to the extent practically possible) when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability. Fair values are categorised into different fair value hierarchy levels based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: – Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; – Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and – Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. JV Newco recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes: – Acquisitions (Note 3); – Goodwill and other intangibles assets (Note 11); – Earn-out obligations (Note 22); – Put option liabilities (Note 23); and – Financial instruments (Note 26).

At their initial recognition, some of the book values carried by the previous shareholder were subject to conversion from local accounting principles as applied by the contributing shareholder to IFRS as applied by JV Newco. Recognized book value carrying amounts for goodwill and non-current assets are based on the fair value accounting applied at initial acquisition by the venturers prior to their contributions to JV Newco. Contributed book values of goodwill and non-current assets have been allocated to cash-generating units as identified within the joint operations of JV Newco. After formation of the joint venture JV Newco accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to JV Newco. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of net assets acquired, and represents the future economic benefits that arise from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised. Any gain on a bargain purchase (negative goodwill) is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities. Goodwill on acquisition of associates/joint ventures is included in investments in associates/joint ventures. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Adjustments to the fair value of the consideration transferred and the provisional fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities in a business combination, identified within 12 months of the date of acquisition, are recognised retrospectively, provided that the new information relates to conditions that existed at the date of acquisition. In case the consideration transferred consists of (an) initial cash payment(s) and estimated future earn-out obligation based on (or related to) estimates of future results, any such obligations are only recognised as consideration if payments are not depending on future employment of the seller. An adjustment in the earn-out obligation recognised as consideration is accounted for in profit or loss. As part of a business combination, JV Newco can grant an option to non-controlling interests (e.g. a minority shareholder), to sell to JV Newco (part of) their remaining interest in the business acquired. If such a put option provides for settlement in cash, any such obligations are only recognised as consideration if payments are not dependent on future employment of the seller. JV Newco treats such a transaction as if the put option has been exercised at acquisition date (the so-called ‘anticipated-acquisition method’) when analysis confirms all significant risks and rewards of the non-controlling interest have been transferred to JV Newco. Accordingly no non-controlling interest is recognised. An adjustment in the put option liability recognised as consideration is accounted for in profit or loss. When a business combination is achieved in stages, the carrying value of the previously held equity interest is remeasured to fair value at acquisition date and the difference is recognised in profit or loss. If share-based payment awards (e.g. replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to pre-combination service.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate components of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to JV Newco and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs are recognised in the income statement as expense when incurred. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment, taking into account the estimated residual value. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted if necessary, annually. Based on the estimated useful life of the underlying assets, the following depreciation periods apply: - Land Indefinite - Buildings 13 – 33 years - Plant and equipment 8 – 13 years - Other 3 – 5 years Leased property, plant and equipment, for which JV Newco substantially assumes all of the benefits and risks of ownership, are classified as finance leases. Determining whether a lease is a finance lease requires judgment as to whether substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership have been transferred to JV Newco. Finance leases are capitalised at their fair value of the leased asset or at the estimated net present value of the underlying minimum lease payments, whichever is the lower. The corresponding current and non-current rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in the statement of financial position as current and non-current payables, respectively. Finance costs are charged to the income statement over the life of each respective lease. Payments made under operating leases, net of lease incentives received, are charged to the income statement in equal instalments over the life of the leases, except where an alternative method is more representative of the time pattern from which benefits are derived. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised whenever JV Newco disposes of it, or when no more future benefits are expected by its use. Profit or loss from the de-recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is calculated as the difference between the net amount of the disposal and the book value of the asset. The profit or loss is recognised in the income statement in the period in which the de-recognition occurs. When assets are sold in a sale-and-lease-back transaction, and the lease-back results in a finance lease, then any gain on the sale is deferred and recognised as income over the lease term.

These assets can either be purchased, acquired in a business combination or internally developed if certain criteria for capitalisation are met. Purchased other intangible assets are stated at cost, which is the purchase price, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation occurs over the period JV Newco is expected to benefit from the use of the intangible asset and commences when the assets are available for use. Format rights are amortised as from the time the format is taken into production and in proportion to the number of episodes produced. (TV) movie rights are amortised using a declining balance method based on the expected consumption of economic benefits from these assets. Development expenditures on individual projects are only recognised as an intangible asset when the following can be demonstrated: – it is technically feasible to complete the project so that it will be available for either use or sale; – there is an intention to complete the project; – the completed project is able to be either used or sold; – the manner(s) in which the asset is expected to generate future economic benefits; – resources are available to complete the project; and – development expenditures can be measured reliably. The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria.

For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the smallest identifiable cash-generating unit. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent years. Except for goodwill, JV Newco assesses in subsequent years whether indications exist that impairment losses previously recognised for non-current assets may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of that asset (or cash generating unit) is recalculated and its carrying amount is increased to the revised recoverable amount. The increase is recognised in the income statement. A reversal is recognised only if it arises from a change in the assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount.

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which JV Newco pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. JV Newco’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for JV Newco, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements. Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. JV Newco determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. JV Newco recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. For other long-term employee benefits, such as long-term service benefits, the net obligation is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when JV Newco can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when JV Newco recognises costs for a restructuring.

This is considered to be an obligation as JV Newco acquires its own equity, even if the exercise is contingent and conditional, when analysis confirms all significant risks and rewards of the non-controlling interest have been transferred to JV Newco, as such no non-controlling interest is recognised. Where contingent consideration payable in the future is employment linked, it is treated as an employee benefit expense in the income statement over the period of required employment. The liability is stated at the net present value of the accrued part of the future obligation. To the extent dividend payments to minority shareholders reduce the redemption amount, they are recognised against the put option liability.

The stage of completion is ordinarily determined with reference to either: – the proportion of finished episodes (to date) to total episodes to be produced under the contract (measurement of stage of completion may be done on the basis of delivery if this is a better measurement); or – the proportion of production days spent (to date) to total production days expected to be made under the contract (mainly applicable for scripted productions like telenovela’s and movies) If the outcome of a production contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent it is probable that expenses incurred are recoverable. Contract costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred unless they create an asset related to future contract activity. An expected loss on a contract is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Production revenue includes the initial amount agreed in the contract plus any variations in production work, claims and incentive payments, to the extent that it is probable that these will result in revenue and they can be measured reliably.

JV Newco defines EBITDA as profit for the period before depreciation, amortisation, impairment, financial income, financial expense, share in profit of associates and income tax. EBITDA is not a measurement under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to (a) net profit, (b) cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs, or (c) any other measures or performance under IFRS. EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by JV Newco’s cash flow statement and should be considered in the context of our financial commitments. EBITDA may not be indicative of our historical operating results, and may not be predictive of our potential future results. Because not all companies calculate EBITDA identically, the presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly named measures of other companies. To enhance the insight into the financial results of the Company’s activities, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income shows EBITDA before (operating) exceptional items.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where JV Newco is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner, in which JV Newco expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and JV Newco intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

JV Newco measures all derivative financial instruments based on fair values, derived from market prices or a valuation model. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. JV Newco designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge). JV Newco documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. JV Newco also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. F-370 ----- The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within ‘Net financial income (expense)’. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in the income statement within ‘Net financial income (expense)’. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement within ‘Net financial income (expense)’. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. In 2016, no hedge accounting has been applied. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement within ‘Net financial income (expense)’.

According to the Company’s initial assessment, the disclosure initiative of IAS 7 will not have a material impact on the financial statements. A further assessment will be done in 2017. F-371 ----- IAS 12 – Amendments made to IAS 12 clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. This amendment has no impact on the Company’s financial statements. IFRS 15 – The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to the customer, so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards. A new five step approach must be applied before revenue can be recognised: – Identify contracts with customers; – Identify the separate performance obligations; – Determine the transaction price of the contract; – Allocate the transaction price to each of the separate performance obligations; and – Recognise the revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. Considering the Company’s current revenue recognition policy, the Company’s first assessment shows no material impact from applying the new IFRS 15 standard. A further assessment will be performed in 2017. IFRS 15 will be applied for the first time in the financial year 2018. IFRS 9 – The final version of IFRS 9 contains revised regulations for the classifications and measurement of financial assets, new requirements for impairment of financial instruments and new requirements for hedge accounting. The impact of the application of the revised standard on the Company’s financial statements has not been assessed yet. IFRS 9 will be applied for the first time in the financial year 2018. IFRS 16 – The new standard sets out principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for leases. The changes mainly affect lessee accounting and generally require lessees to recognize contractual rights and obligations on the lessee’s balance sheet. The standard replaces the straight-line recognition of operating lease expense for those leases applying IAS 17 with the recognition of depreciation expenses for the right-of-use asset and interest expenses on the lease liability (included within the financial result). In addition, IFRS 16 includes more extensive disclosures in the notes for lessees. The new standard will have an impact on the financial statements of the Company. Examples of leases where the new standard will have an impact are leases for the rental of buildings and studio’s. An initial assessment will be performed in 2017.

On 23 September 2016, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed (i.e., approved) the bankruptcy plan proposed by the CORE Debtors. The plan provided for a significant de-leveraging of the CORE Debtors pursuant to which, among other things, holders of equity interests in the CORE Debtors (including CORE Entertainment Holdings’ equity interest in CORE Entertainment, Inc.) did not receive any distribution on account thereof. As such, JV Newco’s indirect equity interest in CORE Media Group was cancelled for no consideration. Under the CORE Debtors’ bankruptcy plan, unsecured creditors were entitled to share pro rata in a distribution of cash (up to USD 2,375,000 in the aggregate and not to exceed 10% of its unsecured claim) and certain residual rights in respect of actions brought against parties not released from claims under the plan. As a legal matter, JV Newco remained the controlling stockholder of CORE Entertainment Holdings Inc. with the authority to appoint a majority of the board of directors. However, upon the CORE Debtors’ emergence from bankruptcy on 17 October 2016, CORE Entertainment Holdings Inc.’s shares in CORE Entertainment Inc. were cancelled such that CORE Entertainment Holdings Inc. no longer owns CORE Entertainment Inc. or any of its subsidiaries nor has the right to manage CORE’s business.

Within the Dutch fiscal unity profits and losses of the group companies are offset. Over the 2016 and 2015 reporting periods the Dutch fiscal unity was in a tax loss position. At the derecognition of CORE Media Group as described in Note 3, the Company derecognized the non-valuated losses and tax credits pertaining to CORE Media Group. In business combinations in 2014 the Company recognised deferred tax liabilities pertaining to identified assets at book values as previously carried by the contributing shareholder where the tax base was not affected by the business combination. The Company subsequently recognized tax benefits in respect of fiscal losses of the fiscal unity in certain jurisdictions to the extent it can be set off against deferred tax liabilities arising from the business combinations that relate to the fiscal unity of that particular jurisdiction. To the extent losses cannot be set off against deferred tax liabilities, valuation (if any) of fiscal losses is based on forecasts of future results and assessment of probability of its realisation.

458_2,Offerings 2020.md,100,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,100.124,Annual test for impairment,100.124.1,,"During the financial period 2016, the Company assessed the recoverable amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, based on a detailed forecast per CGU taking into account various downside adjustments to the detailed business plans. This level 3 assessment leads to the conclusion that an impairment was required for an amount of EUR (75.4) million, EUR (79.6) million including FX, for the CGU US. An additional impairment charge was incurred for the CGU Rest of World in the amount of EUR (16.6) million, EUR (17.5) million including FX. An impairment charge of EUR (92.0) million has been reported in the statement of comprehensive income. Impairment US is mainly driven by lower plan projections and refocused scripted approach. In Rest of the World, Endemol Shine is refocusing its regional strategy in some markets. Goodwill of the cash generating units has been tested for impairment at year-end 2016 based on the latest shortand long-term business forecasts. The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units have been determined based on a fair value less cost of disposal approach. To determine the fair value less cost of disposal, cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and forward-looking statements, approved by senior management, for the underlying operations of a cash generating unit. These projections include estimates for the cost savings that have been realized and are to be realized from several cost savings initiatives. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties as they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Accordingly, actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may differ from those assumed in the forward-looking statements. The key assumptions used for the fair value less cost of disposal calculations relate to discount rate and terminal value growth rate, revenue growth and EBITDA margin. The post-tax discount rates, applied to the cash flow projections, vary between 7.0% and 14.7%. These rates have been calculated using the weighted average cost of capital methodology. The main parameters are the targeted debt-to-equity ratio, the risk-free interest rate based on government bonds and a risk premium. The terminal value growth rate is based on the lower of i) the risk-free rate for all Euro denominated CGU’s or the risk free rate plus inflation differential for other CGU, and ii) the estimated local long-term inflation expectation. The revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and our expectations for growth rates and EBITDA margins achievable in the markets the Company is active in. Consolidated for the Company the average annual compounded revenue growth rate applied in the projected periods is 5.2%. The average annual compounded revenue growth rate applied for the main CGU’s ranged between 1.4% and 10.6%. Consolidated for the Company the terminal value year EBITDA margin applied is 9.5%. The terminal value year EBITDA margins applied for the main CGU’s ranged between 6.2% and 21.3%. Consolidated for the Company the terminal value growth rate applied is 1.5%. The terminal value growth rate applied for the CGU’s ranged between 0.9% and 1.9%. F-383 ----- In addition to the forecast used in the impairment test, a sensitivity analysis has been prepared. In the scenario of using a 50 bps higher discount rate, this would lead to recognizing a total impairment charge of EUR (131) million, of which EUR (97) million would relate to the CGU US, the remaining impairment charge would relate to the CGUs France, Rest of World and International & Distribution. A 5% lower terminal value EBITDA level would lead to recognizing a total impairment of EUR (104) million, of which EUR (90) million would relate to the CGU US. The remaining impairment charge would relate to the CGUs France, Rest of World and International & Distribution. The following table illustrates for the CGUs with limited headroom the sensitivity to changes in the terminal value EBITDA which would result in a recoverable amount equal to the carrying amount and the headroom based on current projections:",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

In addition, the Group may request one or more incremental term loan facilities and/or increase commitments under its First Lien Credit Agreement and request one or more incremental term loan facilities under its Second Lien Agreement in an aggregate amount of up to the sum of EUR 200 million plus such additional amount as long as, (i) in the case of loans under additional credit facilities that rank equally to the liens on the collateral securing the Term B Loans and the Initial Revolving Loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement, its consolidated net first lien leverage ratio would be no greater than 3.40 to 1.00 and (ii) in the case of loans under additional credit facilities that rank junior to the liens on the collateral securing the Term B Loans and the Initial Revolving Loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement and equally and without preference with, or junior to, the liens on the collateral securing the Term Loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement, its consolidated net secured leverage ratio would be no greater than 5.20 to 1.00, subject to certain conditions and receipt of commitments by existing or additional lenders. All borrowings under the Group’s revolving credit facility under the First Lien Credit Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default and the accuracy of representations and warranties. Prior to the maturity date of 13 August 2021, the First Lien Term B Loans require scheduled quarterly amortization payments in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans, the first payment of which was due on 31 December 2014, with the balance due at maturity. In 2016, amortization payments of EUR 11.5 million were made (2015: EUR 11.5 million). Amortization payments due in 2017 amount to EUR 11.3 million. Within the context of the financing agreements, guarantees and securities have been provided by several of Endemol Shine’s entities established in the Security Jurisdictions (United States, England and Wales, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain and Australia) and guarantees have been provided by certain Endemol Shine entities established in Italy, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Borrowings of term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) are subject to a 1.00% floor. The First Lien Credit Agreement includes customary mandatory prepayment requirements based on certain events, such as asset sales, certain debt issuances and defined levels of excess cash flow. The Second Lien Credit Agreement includes customary mandatory prepayment requirements based on certain events, such as asset sales and certain debt issuances. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty and subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR rate loans. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement at any time. In the event of any prepayment before 13 August 2017, such prepayment will be accompanied by a 1.00% prepayment premium. All prepayments will be subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans. The revolving credit facility under the First Lien Credit Agreement includes a springing financial maintenance covenant that requires the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio not to exceed 5.50 to 1.00. The covenant will be tested quarterly when the revolving credit facility is more than 30% drawn (excluding outstanding letters of credit other than letters of credit supporting debt for borrowed money). As of 31 December 2016, the borrowings under the revolving credit facility were more than 30% of the outstanding commitments; therefore, the covenant was in effect (2015: borrowings less than 30% of the outstanding commitments and the covenant was not in effect). As of 31 December 2016, the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio did not exceed the maximum of 5.5. F-392 ----- The First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement also contain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, and the negative covenants limit the Group’s ability to, among other things: incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; create liens on certain assets; make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions); pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of its capital stock or make other restricted payments; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; sell assets; enter into certain transactions with its affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; change its lines of business; restrict dividends from its subsidiaries or restrict liens; change its fiscal year; and modify the terms of certain debt or organizational agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

The First Lien Term has an aggregate principal amount of USD 200 million. The Second Lien Term Loan has an aggregate principal amount of USD 160 million. Starting 11 June 2015, CORE Media Group elected not to make the scheduled quarterly interest payments on the USD 160 million Second Lien Term Loan, giving the Second Lien holders the right to default interest and to accelerate the maturity of the debt. On 26 July 2015 CORE Media Group has entered into forbearance agreements with its lenders holding the majority of the debt outstanding under each of the First and Second Lien Term Loans. The forbearance agreements placed certain restrictions on CORE Media Group during the forbearance period including certain payments to affiliates and payment of interest on the Second Lien Term Loan. The forbearance agreements further required CORE Media Group to continue negotiations with the respective lender groups during the forbearance period. Due to certain cross default provisions in the loan agreement which would be triggered if the Second Lien holders exercise their rights to accelerate their debt, both the First Lien Term Loan and the Second Lien Term Loan were classified as current as of 31 December 2015. Per 17 October 2016 JV Newco lost control over the CORE Media activities subject to a financial restructuring as described in Note 3 and JV Newco derecognized all assets and liabilities pertaining to the CORE Media Group. The First Lien Term was scheduled to mature on 21 June 2017 and bore interest at a rate of 9.0% per annum or 11% per annum when in default.

This plan is a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan, which is accounted for as a defined contribution plan because sufficient information for defined benefit accounting is not available. PNO Media is a multi-employer pension fund and PNO Media is not able to provide Endemol with sufficient information on the present value of the benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets and the funded status of Endemol.

For the key executives within certain local operations a local LTIP was introduced running for a 4 to 5-year period. All bonus payments under the LTIPs (if any) will be made in cash. The LTIPs are aimed to align the interests of the stakeholders with the participating executives by virtue of sharing part of the value created of the relevant Group entities. The value creation is predominantly driven by a growth in applicable earnings measured over the relevant LTIP period. If there is no or limited growth of earnings over the LTIP period, the LTIPs are not in the money. The LTIP plans provide for an advance payment of 30% of the estimated total cash bonus payable at the end of the LTIP period (if any) to each participant in the course of 3rd year of the 5-year plan period.

The LTIPs are in substance considered profit-sharing arrangements and are accounted for as an employee benefit in accordance with IAS 19. The expenses in connection with such plans are attributed to the period in which the services that give rise to the obligation are rendered. In terms of the LTIP, the Company only accounts for LTIP expenses in any given period if it is management’s best estimate as of the end of that period that the plan will be “in the money” and the bonus payable can be estimated reliably.

Series A, which was issued in connection with a merger on 21 June 2011, was convertible to common shares of the issuer at the option of the holder at any time and at the option of the issuer in connection with certain public offerings on the issuer on or after 21 June 2015. The Series A was redeemable at the option of the issuer between 21 June 2015 and 21 June 2016 or in connection with a public offering on the issuer at any time on or after 21 June 2015. On 10 December 2015 CORE Media Group repurchased 65,000 shares of the Series A at the cash price of USD 0.03 (three cents) per share. CORE Media Group subsequently exercised its right to retire all of the repurchased shares and recorded the offset in the income statement.

The Series B was also redeemable at the option of the issuer under certain circumstances, including if the holder ceased to be employed by the acquired company. The Series B paid an annual dividend until the Series B was converted or redeemed. The future dividend was tied to the future results of the acquired business. Due to the contingent employment features of the Series B, the Series B was accounted for as a liability separate from the business combination in 2012 and treated as compensation.

JV Newco’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on JV Newco’s financial performance. Derivative financial instruments can be used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the JV Newco Management Board. Treasury identifies, evaluates, mitigates and transfers/hedges financial risks. The Management Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.

458_2,Offerings 2020.md,100,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,100.208,Foreign currency risk,100.208.1,,"JV Newco assesses foreign currency risk by identifying and monitoring changes in exchange rate exposures that may adversely impact the income statement, cash flow and equity. JV Newco maintains risk management control systems to monitor foreign currency risk attributable to both outstanding foreign currency positions and commitments, as well as offsetting hedge positions. The risk management control systems involve the centralisation of JV Newco’s foreign currency exposure management, the netting and offsetting exposures from different group companies and the use of analytical techniques, including sensitivity analysis, to estimate the expected impact of changes in foreign currency rates. JV Newco group companies enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the group company concerned. Significant transactions and operations in foreign currency, that could materially impact JV Newco’s statement of financial position and profit and loss, occur mainly in USD and GBP. These transactions expose JV Newco to foreign currency results. By means of natural hedging as well as foreign currency forward contracts JV Newco minimises exchange results on receivables, payables and expected future cash-flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Financial derivatives can be used to economically hedge the net exchange results due to changes in foreign currency rates. Effective 8 January 2015, the Company entered into a EUR 350.0 million for USD 412 million Cross Currency Swap (CCS), at spot rate USD/EUR 1.177. The CCS partly off sets the mismatch between the currency mix of the external loans and borrowings and the currency mix of EBITDA and cash flow and in addition converts the company’s floating interest obligation in respect of 60% of the principal amount of the EUR-denominated loans to a fixed rate. Changes in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are reported in the income statement as fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments and (partially) offset the exchange results recognised as foreign exchange results on the assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. It is Endemol Shine’s policy to settle foreign currency forward contracts within the reporting period.

On 23 September 2016, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed (i.e., approved) the bankruptcy plan proposed by the CORE Debtors. The plan provides for a significant de-leveraging of the CORE Debtors pursuant to which, among other things, holders of equity interests in the CORE Debtors (including CORE Entertainment Holdings’ equity interest in CORE Entertainment, Inc.) did not receive any distribution on account thereof. Under the CORE Debtors’ bankruptcy plan, unsecured creditors are entitled to share pro rata in a distribution of cash (up to USD 2,375,000 in the aggregate and not to exceed 10% of its unsecured claim) and certain residual rights in respect of actions brought against parties not released from claims under the plan. On December 12, 2016, a litigation trust (the “Litigation Trust”) that was created in connection with the bankruptcy of CORE Media, Inc. and several of its affiliates (collectively, “Core”) filed a lawsuit in the State Courts in California in the United States, against certain Apollo companies, 21CF companies and Endemol Shine entities. As part of the Core’s plan of reorganization, the Litigation Trust was assigned the legal claims previously belonging to various entities which loaned money to Core. The complaint alleges that the defendants induced a breach of such loan agreements or intentionally interfered with such loan agreements. The Litigation Trust is seeking both compensatory and punitive damage in an undetermined amount against each of the 21 defendants it has named in the litigation, including MediArena Holding B.V. and Endemol USA Holding, Inc. The Company has indicated that it intends to vigorously defend its rights. In 2017 the court in California ruled in favour of a motion filed by the Company to dismiss the Core Litigation in California to force it to be refiled in New York. Based on management’s current consideration of the facts and circumstances, no provision has been recorded.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954

As part of that refocus, the decision was made to unwind the operations in Turkey and to liquidate the local operating company in Turkey because of the situation set out below. In relation to this decision the Company will incur restructuring and exceptional costs in 2017. In May 2017 group management of Endemol Shine discovered serious issues around the local management of Endemol Shine Turkey. Group management has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the business in Istanbul which included an investigation by a local law firm and assistance and advice from independent financial consultants. These investigations revealed certain project-related write-downs of which EUR 11 million was accounted for in 2016 and included in the exceptional items. Group management concluded, following the investigation by the law firm, that local management in Turkey did not comply with governance requirements and while every effort was made to find an alternative solution, the only viable option was to file for insolvency of Endemol Shine Turkey. The first hearing in the bankruptcy process took place last year and at the end of last year Audit Administrators were appointed to approve all payments made by Endemol Shine Turkey. The next hearing in the bankruptcy process is on 25 January 2018 and we expect that an expert will be appointed to consider the bankruptcy imminently. The Court has made decisions on disbursement of distribution income from exploitation of titles owned by Endemol Shine Turkey, which will reduce outstanding liabilities over time. Following the decision to liquidate, further assets impairments, amounting to EUR 17 million, will be recorded in the 2017 financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,954
